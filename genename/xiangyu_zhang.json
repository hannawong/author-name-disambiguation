        "title": "Fault location via precise dynamic slicing",
        "abstract": "Developing automated techniques for identifying a fault candidate set (i.e., subset of executed statements that contains the faulty code responsible for the failure during a program run), can greatly reduce the effort of debugging. Over 15 years ago precise dynamic slicing was proposed to identify a fault candidate set as consisting of all executed statements that influence the computation of an incorrect value through a chain of data and/or control dependences. However, the challenge of making precise dynamic slicing practical has not been addressed. This dissertation addresses this challenge and makes precise dynamic slicing useful for debugging realistic applications. First, the cost of computing precise dynamic slices is greatly reduced. Second, innovative ways of using precise dynamic slicing are identified to produce small failure candidate sets. The key cause of high space and time cost of precise dynamic slicing is the very large size of dynamic dependence graphs that are constructed and traversed for computing dynamic slices. By developing a novel series of optimizations the size of the dynamic dependence graph is greatly reduced leading to a compact representation that can be rapidly traversed. Average space needed is reduced from 2 Gigabytes to 94 Megabytes for dynamic dependence graphs corresponding to executions with average lengths of 130 Million instructions. The precise dynamic slicing time is reduced from up to 20 minutes for a demand-driven algorithm to 16 seconds. A compression algorithm is developed to further reduce dependence graph sizes. The resulting representation achieves the space efficiency such that the dynamic execution history of executing a couple of billion instructions can be held in a Gigabyte of memory. To further scale precise dynamic slicing to longer program runs, a novel approach is proposed that uses checkpointing/logging to enable collection of dynamic history of only the relevant window of execution.Classical backward dynamic slicing can often produce fault candidate sets that contain thousands of statements making the task of identifying faulty code very time consuming for the programmer. Novel techniques are proposed to improve effectiveness of dynamic slicing for fault location. The merit of these techniques lies in identifying multiple forms of dynamic slices in a failed run and then intersecting them to produce smaller fault candidate sets. Using these techniques, the fault candidate set size corresponding to the backward dynamic slice is reduced by nearly a factor of 3. A fine-grained statistical pruning technique based on value profiles is also developed and this technique reduces the sizes of backward dynamic slices by a factor of 2.5. In conclusion, this dissertation greatly reduces the cost of precise dynamic slicing and presents techniques to improve its effectiveness for fault location.",

        "abstract": "Ajax becomes more and more important for web applications that care about client side user experience. It allows sending requests asynchronously, without blocking clients from continuing execution. Callback functions are only executed upon receiving the responses. While such mechanism makes browsing a smooth experience, it may cause severe problems in the presence of unexpected network latency, due to the non-determinism of asynchronism. In this paper, we demonstrate the possible problems caused by the asynchronism and propose a static program analysis to automatically detect such bugs in web applications. As client side Ajax code is often wrapped in server-side scripts, we also develop a technique that extracts client-side JavaScript code from server-side scripts. We evaluate our technique on a number of real-world web applications. Our results show that it can effectively identify real bugs. We also discuss possible ways to avoid such bugs.",

        "title": "Whole Execution Traces",
        "abstract": "Different types of program profiles (control flow, value, address, and dependence) have been collected and extensively studied by researchers to identify program characteristics that can then be exploited to develop more effective compilers and architectures. Due to the large amounts of profile data produced by realistic program runs, most work has focused on separately collecting and compressing different types of profiles. In this paper we present a unified representation of profiles called Whole Execution Trace (WET) which includes the complete information contained in each of the above types of traces. Thus WETs provide a basis for a next generation software tool that will enable mining of program profiles to identify program characteristics that require understanding of relationships among various types of profiles. The key features of our WET representation are: WET is constructed by labeling a static program representation with profile information such that relavent and related profile information can be directly accessed by analysis algorithms as they traverse the representation; a highly effective two tier strategy is used to significantly compress the WET; and compression techniques are designed such that they do not adversely affect the ability to rapidly traverse WET for extracting subsets of information corresponding to individual profile types as well as a combination of profile types (e.g., in form of dynamic slices of WETs). Our experimentation shows that on an average execution traces resulting from execution of 647 Million statements can be stored in 331 Megabytes of storage after compression. The compression factors range from 16 to 83. Moreover the rates at which different types of profiles can be individually or simultaneously extracted are high.",

        "abstract": "We aim to debug a single failing execution without the assistance from other passing/failing runs. In our context, debugging is a process with substantial uncertainty - lots of decisions have to be made such as what variables shall be inspected first. To deal with such uncertainty, we propose to equip machines with human-like intelligence. Specifically, we develop a highly automated debugging technique that aims to couple human-like reasoning (e.g., dealing with uncertainty and fusing knowledge) with program semantics based analysis, to achieve benefits from the two and mitigate their limitations. We model debugging as a probabilistic inference problem, in which the likelihood of each executed statement instance and variable being correct/faulty is modeled by a random variable. Human knowledge, human-like reasoning rules and program semantics are modeled as conditional probability distributions, also called probabilistic constraints. Solving these constraints identifies the most likely faulty statements. Our results show that the technique is highly effective. It can precisely identify root causes for a set of real-world bugs in a very small number of interactions with developers, much smaller than a recent proposal that does not encode human intelligence. Our user study also confirms that it substantially improves human productivity.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Logging and replay is important to reproducing software failures and recovering from failures. Replaying a long execution is time consuming, especially when replay is further integrated with runtime techniques that require expensive instrumentation, such as dependence detection. In this paper, we propose a technique to reduce a replay log while retaining its ability to reproduce a failure. While traditional logging records only system calls and signals, our technique leverages the compiler to selectively collect additional information on the fly. Upon a failure, the log can be reduced by analyzing itself. The collection is highly optimized. The additional runtime overhead of our technique, compared to a plain logging tool, is trivial (2.61% average) and the size of additional log is comparable to the original log. Substantial reduction can be cost-effectively achieved through a search based algorithm. The reduced log is guaranteed to reproduce the failure.",

Indeed, the emergence of tiny devices that sense environmental cues and trigger actuators after consulting logic and human preferences promises a more environmentally aware and less wasteful society.

        "abstract": " While smartphones and mobile apps have been an integral part of our life, modern mobile apps tend to contain a lot of rarely used functionalities. For example, applications contain advertisements and offer extra features such as recommended news stories in weather apps. While these functionalities are not essential to an app, they nonetheless consume power, CPU cycles and bandwidth. In this paper, we design a UI driven approach that allows customizing an Android app by removing its unwanted functionalities. In particular, our technique displays the UI and allows the user to select elements denoting functionalities that she wants to remove. Using this information, our technique automatically removes all the code elements related to the selected functionalities, including all the relevant background tasks. The underlying analysis is a type system, in which each code element is tagged with a type indicating if it should be removed. From the UI hints, our technique infers types for all other code elements and reduces the app accordingly. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on 10 real-world Android apps. The results show that our approach can accurately discover the removable code elements and lead to substantial resource savings in the reduced apps. \n\n",

        "abstract": "Studying the relative behavior of an application\u2019s threads is critical to identifying performance bottlenecks and understanding their root causes. We present context-sensitive parallel (CSP) execution profiles, that capture the relative behavior of threads in terms of the user selected code regions they execute. CSPs can be analyzed to compute execution times spent by the application in interesting behavior states. To capture execution context, code regions of interest can be given static and dynamic names using a versatile set of annotations. The CSP divides the execution time of a multithreaded application into a sequence of time intervals called frames, during which no thread transitions between code regions. By appropriate selection and naming of code regions, the user can obtain a CSP that captures all occurrences of arbitrary behavior states. We provide the user with a powerful query language to facilitate the analysis of CSPs. Our implementation for collection of CSPs of C++ programs has low overhead and high accuracy. Collection of CSPs of full executions of 12 Parsec programs incurred overhead of at most 7% in execution time. The accuracy of CSPs was validated in the context of common performance problems such as load imbalance in pipeline stages and the presence of straggler threads.",

        "abstract": "A future is a well-known programming construct used to introduce concurrency into sequential programs. Computations annotated as futures are executed asynchronously and run concurrently with their continuations. Typically, futures are not transparent annotations: a program with futures need not produce the same result as the sequential program from which it was derived. Safe futures guarantee that a future-annotated program produces the same result as its sequential counterpart. The safety property is trivially satisfied in languages without side-effects or exceptions. In the presence of mutable references and language abstractions, such as exceptions, which permit the expression of non-local control-flow, ensuring safety requires that the future-annotated program adhere to control and data dependences imposed by the program's sequential counterpart. In this paper, we present a formulation of safe futures for a higher-order functional language with first-class references and exceptions. Safety can be guaranteed at runtime by blocking a continuation from performing a potentially unsafe action before its futures have completed. To enable greater concurrency, we develop a static analysis and instrumentation and formalize the runtime behavior for instrumented programs that allows a continuation to proceed before its futures complete, as long as its actions are determined to be safe. A continuation's action is safe if it is not control or data dependent on actions that may subsequently be performed by its futures.",

        "abstract": "Fixing runtime bugs in long running programs using trace based analyses such as dynamic slicing was believed to be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we present a novel execution fast forwarding technique that makes this feasible. While a naive solution is to divide the entire execution by checkpoints, and then apply dynamic slicing enabled by tracing to one checkpoint interval at a time, it is still too costly even with state-of-the-art tracing techniques. Our technique is derived from two key observations. The first one is that long running programs are usually driven by events, which has been taken advantage of by checkpointing/replaying techniques to deterministically replay an execution from the event log. The second observation is that all the events are not relevant to replaying a particular part of the execution, in which the programmer suspects an error happened. We develop a slicing-like technique that can be used to prune irrelevant events from the event log. Driven by the reduced log, the replayed execution is now traced for fault location. This replayed execution has the effect of fast forwarding, i.e the amount of executed instructions is significantly reduced without losing the accuracy of reproducing a failure. Our evaluation shows that skipping irrelevant events can reduce the space requirement for dynamic slicing by factors ranging from 72 to 44490. We also describe how checkpointing and tracing enabled dynamic slicing are combined, which we believe is the first attempt to integrate these two techniques. Finally, the dynamic slices of a set of reported bugs for long running programs are studied to show the effectiveness of dynamic slicing.",

        "abstract": "With the wide existence of binary code, it is desirable to reuse it in many security applications, such as malware analysis and software patching. While prior approaches have shown that binary code can be extracted and reused, they are often based on static analysis and face challenges when coping with obfuscated binaries. This paper introduces trace-oriented programming (TOP), a general framework for generating new software from existing binary code by elevating the low-level binary code to C code with templates and inlined assembly. Different from existing work, TOP gains benefits from dynamic analysis such as resilience against obfuscation and avoidance of points-to analysis. Thus, TOP can be used for malware analysis, especially for malware function analysis and identification. We have implemented a proof-of-concept of TOP and our evaluation results with a range of benign and malicious software indicate that TOP is able to reconstruct source code from binary execution traces in malware analysis and identification, and binary function transplanting.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents Apex, a system that can automatically generate explanations for programming assignment bugs, regarding where the bugs are and how the root causes led to the runtime failures. It works by comparing the passing execution of a correct implementation (provided by the instructor) and the failing execution of the buggy implementation (submitted by the student). The technique overcomes a number of technical challenges caused by syntactic and semantic differences of the two implementations. It collects the symbolic traces of the executions and matches assignment statements in the two execution traces by reasoning about symbolic equivalence. It then matches predicates by aligning the control dependences of the matched assignment statements, avoiding direct matching of path conditions which are usually quite different. Our evaluation shows that Apex is every effective for 205 buggy real world student submissions of 4 programming assignments, and a set of 15 programming assignment type of buggy programs collected from stackoverflow.com, precisely pinpointing the root causes and capturing the causality for 94.5% of them. The evaluation on a standard benchmark set with over 700 student bugs shows similar results. A user study in the classroom shows that Apex has substantially improved student productivity.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, string solvers have become an essential component in many formal verification, security analysis, and bug-finding tools. Such solvers typically support a theory of string equations, the length function, and the regular-expression membership predicate. These enable considerable expressive power, which comes at the cost of slow solving time, and in some cases even non-termination. We present three techniques, designed for word-based SMT string solvers, to mitigate these problems: (1) detecting overlapping variables, which is essential to avoiding common cases of non-termination; (2) pruning of the search space via bi-directional integration between the string and integer theories, enabling new cross-domain heuristics; and (3) a binary search based heuristic, allowing the procedure to skip unnecessary string length queries and converge on consistent length assignments faster for large strings. We have implemented above techniques atop the Z3-str solver, resulting in a significantly more robust and efficient solver, dubbed Z3str2, for the quantifier-free theory of string equations, the regular-expression membership predicate, and linear arithmetic over the length function. We report on a series of experiments over four sets of challenging real-world benchmarks, where we compare Z3str2 with five different string solvers: S3, CVC4, Kaluza, PISA and Stranger. Each of these tools utilizes a different solving strategy and/or string representation (based e.g. on words, bit vectors or automata). The results point to the efficacy of our proposed techniques, which yield dramatic performance improvement. We also demonstrate performance improvements enabled by Z3str2 in the context of symbolic execution for string-manipulating programs. We observe that the techniques presented here are of broad applicability, and can be integrated into other string solvers to improve their performance.",

The extreme resource constraints inherent to WSNs, the in situ deployment in harsh environments and the lack of run-time support tools make debugging and maintaining WSN applications very challenging. In particular, run-time debugging tools are required to detect and diagnose complex run-time faults such as race-conditions, which occur due to unexpected interaction with the real-world environment. The ability to repeatedly reproduce the failure by replaying the execution from the trace of events that took place can play a crucial role in debugging such faults. Obtaining such a trace is made difficult due to tight resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a lightweight tracing tool for WSNs which uses a novel control flow tracing and encoding scheme to generate a highly compressed control-flow trace. In addition to the construction of the trace, our tracing tool supports storing the trace in non-volatile memory and querying interface that allows base station to retrieve the trace when needed. We show the effectiveness of our tracing tool through a case-study and illustrate its low overhead through measurements.",

        "title": "Pruning dynamic slices with confidence",
        "abstract": "Given an incorrect value produced during a failed program run (e.g., a wrong output value or a value that causes the program to crash), the backward dynamic slice of the value very frequently captures the faulty code responsible for producing the incorrect value. Although the dynamic slice often contains only a small percentage of the statements executed during the failed program run, the dynamic slice can still be large and thus considerable effort may be required by the programmer to locate the faulty code.In this paper we develop a strategy for pruning the dynamic slice to identify a subset of statements in the dynamic slice that are likely responsible for producing the incorrect value. We observe that some of the statements used in computing the incorrect value may also have been involved in computing correct values (e.g., a value produced by a statement in the dynamic slice of the incorrect value may also have been used in computing a correct output value prior to the incorrect value). For each such executed statement in the dynamic slice, using the value profiles of the executed statements, we compute a confidence value ranging from 0 to 1 - a higher confidence value corresponds to greater likelihood that the execution of the statement produced a correct value. Given a failed run involving execution of a single error, we demonstrate that the pruning of a dynamic slice by excluding only the statements with the confidence value of 1 is highly effective in reducing the size of the dynamic slice while retaining the faulty code in the slice. Our experiments show that the number of distinct statements in a pruned dynamic slice are 1.79 to 190.57 times less than the full dynamic slice. Confidence values also prioritize the statements in the dynamic slice according to the likelihood of them being faulty. We show that examining the statements in the order of increasing confidence values is an effective strategy for reducing the effort of fault location.",

        "abstract": "Recently, there has been much interest in developing analyzes to detect concurrency bugs that arise because of data races, atomicity violations, execution omission, etc. However, determining whether reported bugs are in fact real, and understanding how these bugs lead to incorrect behavior, remains a labor-intensive process. This paper proposes a novel dynamic analysis that automatically produces the causal path of a concurrent failure leading from the root cause to the failure. Given two schedules, one inducing the failure and the other not, our technique collects traces of the two executions, and compares them to identify salient differences. The causal relation between the differences is disclosed by leveraging a novel slicing algorithm called dual slicing that slices both executions alternatively and iteratively, producing a slice containing trace differences from both runs. Our experiments show that dual slices tend to be very small, often an order of magnitude or more smaller than the corresponding dynamic slices; more importantly, they enable precise analysis of real concurrency bugs for large programs, with reasonable overhead.",

        "abstract": "Diagnosis of performance problems is an essential part of software development and maintenance. This is in particular a challenging problem to be solved in the production environment where only program binaries are available with limited or zero knowledge of the source code. This problem is compounded by the integration with a significant number of third-party software in most large-scale applications. Existing approaches either require source code to embed manually constructed logic to identify performance problems or support a limited scope of applications with prior manual analysis. This paper proposes an automated approach to analyze application binaries and instrument the binary code transparently to inject and apply performance assertions on application transactions. Our evaluation with a set of large-scale application binaries without access to source code discovered 10 publicly known real world performance bugs automatically and shows that PerfGuard introduces very low overhead (less than 3% on Apache and MySQL server) to production systems.",

However, an increasing percent of both malicious and legitimate programs are equipped with anti-debugging and anti-instrumentation techniques, which render existing debuggers and instrumentation tools inadequate. In this paper, we present Spider, a stealthy program instrumentation framework which enables transparent, efficient and flexible instruction-level trapping based on hardware virtualization. Spider uses invisible breakpoint, a novel primitive we develop that inherits the efficiency and flexibility of software breakpoint, and utilizes hardware virtualization to hide its side-effects from the guest. We have implemented a prototype of Spider on KVM. Our evaluation shows that Spider succeeds in remaining transparent against state-of-the-art anti-debugging and anti-instrumentation techniques; the overhead of invisible breakpoint is comparable with traditional hardware breakpoint. We also demonstrate Spider's usage in various security applications.",

Brute force scanning requires effective, robust signatures of kernel data structures. Existing approaches often use the value invariants of certain fields as data structure signatures. However, they do not fully exploit the rich points-to relations between kernel data structures. In this work, we show that such points-to relations can be leveraged to generate graph-based structural invariant signatures. More specifically, we develop SigGraph, a framework that systematically generates non-isomorphic signatures for data structures in an OS kernel. Each signature is a graph rooted at a subject data structure with its edges reflecting the points-to relations with other data structures. Our experiments with a range of Linux kernels show that SigGraph-based signatures achieve high accuracy in recognizing kernel data structure instances via brute force scanning. We further show that SigGraph achieves better robustness against pointer value anomalies and corruptions, without requiring global memory mapping and object reachability. We demonstrate that SigGraph can be applied to kernel memory forensics, kernel rootkit detection, and kernel version inference.",

Given a potentially malicious binary executable, X-Force can force the binary to execute requiring no inputs or proper environment. It also explores different execution paths inside the binary by systematically forcing the branch outcomes of a very small set of conditional control transfer instructions. X-Force features a crash-free execution model that can detect and recover from exceptions. In particular, it can fix invalid memory accesses by allocating memory on-demand and setting the offending pointers to the allocated memory. We have applied X-Force to three security applications. The first is to construct control flow graphs and call graphs for stripped binaries. The second is to expose hidden behaviors of malware, including packed and obfuscated APT malware. X-Force is able to reveal hidden malicious behaviors that had been missed by manual inspection. In the third application, X-Force substantially improves analysis coverage in dynamic type reconstruction for stripped binaries.",

We focus on minimizing logging overhead as it only logs a subset of system calls and thread spawns. Replay is on a single core. During replay, our technique first tries to follow only the event order in the log. However, due to schedule differences, replay may fail. An exploration process is then triggered to search for a schedule that allows the replay to make progress. Exploration is performed within a window preceding the point of replay failure. During exploration, our technique first tries to reorder synchronized blocks. If that does not lead to progress, it further reorders shared variable accesses. The exploration is facilitated by a sophisticated caching mechanism.

        "abstract": "Reversing engineering of data structures involves two aspects: (1) given an application binary, infers the data structure definitions; and (2) given a memory dump, infers the data structure instances. These two capabilities have a number of security and forensics applications that include vulnerability discovery, kernel rootkit detection, and memory forensics. In this dissertation, we present an integrated framework for reverse engineering of data structures from binary. There are three key components in our framework: REWARDS, SigGraph and DIMSUM. REWARDS is a data structure definition reverse engineering component that can automatically uncover both the syntax and semantics of data structures. SigGraph and DIMSUM are two data structure instance reverse engineering components which can recognize the data structure instances in a memory dump. In particular, SigGraph can systematically generate non-isomorphic signatures for data structures in an OS kernel and enable the brute force scanning of kernel memory to find the data structure instances. SigGraph relies on memory mapping information, but DIMSUM, which leverages probabilistic inference techniques, can directly scan memory without memory mapping information. We have developed a number of enabling techniques in our framework that include (1) bi-directional (i.e., backward and forward) data flow analysis, (2) signature graph generation and comparison, and (3) belief propagation based probabilistic inference. We demonstrate how we integrate these techniques into our reverse engineering framework in this dissertation. We have obtained the following preliminary experimental results. REWARDS achieved high accuracy in revealing data structure definitions accessed during an execution. SigGraph recognized Linux kernel data structure instances with zero false negative and close-to-zero false positives, and had strong robustness in the presence of malicious pointer manipulations. DIMSUM achieved higher effectiveness than previous non-probabilistic approaches without memory mapping information.",

        "abstract": "Execution comparison has many applications in debugging, malware analysis, software feature identification, and intrusion detection. Existing comparison techniques have various limitations. Some can only compare at the system event level and require executions to take the same input. Some require storing instruction traces that are very space-consuming and have difficulty dealing with non-determinism. In this paper, we propose a novel dual execution technique that allows on-the-fly comparison at the instruction level. Only differences between the executions are recorded. It allows executions to proceed in a coupled mode such that they share the same input sequence with the same timing, reducing nondeterminism. It also allows them to proceed in a decoupled mode such that the user can interact with each one differently. Decoupled executions can be recoupled to share the same future inputs and facilitate further comparison. We have implemented a prototype and applied it to identifying functional components for reuse, comparative debugging with new GDB primitives, and understanding real world regression failures. Our results show that dual execution is a critical enabling technique for execution comparison.",

        "title": "Detecting Attacks Against Robotic Vehicles: A Control Invariant Approach.",
        "abstract": "Robotic vehicles (RVs), such as drones and ground rovers, are a type of cyber-physical systems that operate in the physical world under the control of computing components in the cyber world. Despite RVs' robustness against natural disturbances, cyber or physical attacks against RVs may lead to physical malfunction and subsequently disruption or failure of the vehicles' missions. To avoid or mitigate such consequences, it is essential to develop attack detection techniques for RVs. In this paper, we present a novel attack detection framework to identify external, physical attacks against RVs on the fly by deriving and monitoring Control Invariants (CI). More specifically, we propose a method to extract such invariants by jointly modeling a vehicle's physical properties, its control algorithm and the laws of physics. These invariants are represented in a state-space form, which can then be implemented and inserted into the vehicle's control program binary for runtime invariant check. We apply our CI framework to eleven RVs, including quadrotor, hexarotor, and ground rover, and show that the invariant check can detect three common types of physical attacks -- including sensor attack, actuation signal attack, and parameter attack -- with very low runtime overhead.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Program control dependence has substantial impact on applications such as dynamic information flow tracking and data lineage tracing (a technique tracking the set of inputs that affects individual outputs). Without considering control dependence, information can leak via implicit channels without being tracked; important inputs may be absent from output lineage. However, considering control dependence may lead to a large volume of false alarms in information flow tracking or undesirably large lineage sets. We identify a special type of control dependence called strict control dependence (SCD). The nature of SCDs highly resembles that of data dependences, reflecting strong correlations between statements and hence should be considered the same way as data dependences in various applications. We formally define the semantics. We also describe a cost-effective design that allows tracing only strict control dependence. Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed technique has very low overhead and it greatly improves the effectiveness of lineage tracing and taint analysis.",

        "abstract": "We develop a method for matching dynamic histories of program executions of two program versions. The matches produced can be useful in many applications including software piracy detection and several debugging scenarios. Unlike some static approaches for matching program versions, our approach does not require access to source code of the two program versions because dynamic histories can be collected by running instrumented versions of program binaries. We base our matching algorithm on comparison of rich program execution histories which include: control flow taken, values produced, addresses referenced, as well as data dependences exercised. In developing a matching algorithm we had two goals: producing an accurate match and producing it quickly. By using rich execution history, we are able to compare the program versions across many behavioral dimensions. The result is a fast and highly precise matching algorithm. Our algorithm first uses individual histories of instructions to identify multiple potential matches and then it refines the set of matches by matching the data dependence structure established by the matching instructions. To test our algorithm we attempted matching of execution histories of unoptimized and optimized program versions. Our results show that our algorithm produces highly accurate matches which are highly effective when used in comparison checking approach to debugging optimized code.",

By analyzing ETW log and critical parts of application executables, a model can be constructed to parse ETW log to units representing independent sub-executions in a process.

While increasingly studied in the area of databases, uncertain data processing is often carried out by software, and thus software based solutions are attractive. In particular, Monte Carlo (MC) methods execute software with many samples from the uncertain inputs and observe the statistical behavior of the output. In this paper, we propose a technique to improve the cost-effectiveness of MC methods. Assuming only part of the input is uncertain, the certain part of the input always leads to the same execution across multiple sample runs. We remove such redundancy by coalescing multiple sample runs in a single run. In the coalesced run, the program operates on a vector of values if uncertainty is present and a single value otherwise. We handle cases where control flow and pointers are uncertain. Our results show that we can speed up the execution time of 30 sample runs by an average factor of 2.3 without precision lost or by up to 3.4 with negligible precision lost.",

Despite these improvements, providing appropriate text inputs remains a prominent obstacle, which hinders the large-scale adoption of automated testing approaches. The key challenge is how to automatically produce the most relevant text in a use case context. For example, a valid website address should be entered in the address bar of a mobile browser app to continue the testing of the app; a singer's name should be entered in the search bar of a music recommendation app. Without the proper text inputs, the testing would get stuck. We propose a novel deep learning based approach to address the challenge, which reduces the problem to a minimization problem. Another challenge is how to make the approach generally applicable to both the trained apps and the untrained apps. We leverage the Word2Vec model to address the challenge.

        "abstract": "Predictive analysis, recently proposed for race detection, guarantees to report no false positives and achieves good coverage. Predictive analysis starts with the trace of an execution and mutates the schedule order of the trace to ``predict'' the executions that expose the hidden races. Ideally, the predictive analysis should allow the schedule mutation to change the memory location accessed by the field access, which helps meet the ``same memory location'' requirement of the data race. However, existing predictive approaches, including causality-preserving approaches and symbolic approaches, lack this capability. We propose the first predictive analysis that allows changing the accessed locations. The key challenge is that modeling of the field accesses relies on the location, which may however become unknown due to schedule mutation. We solve this challenge through a novel combination of predictive analysis and pointer analysis. Furthermore, unlike previous work, our analysis applies a hybrid encoding scheme to increase practical applicability. We have implemented our approach as a prototype IPA, and compared it against the most recent predictive analysis over a set of popular Java applications. Our experimental evaluation confirms the effectiveness of our approach:IPA is able to find close to 2X as many races as previous approaches.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an automated debugging technique that explains a failure by computing its causal path leading from the root cause to the failure. The technique assumes two executions, one passing and the other failing. The two executions could be directly available if the failure is caused by a regression fault. Otherwise, the passing run is auto- matically generated by searching for a dynamic patch. Fine- grained program state comparison between the two runs is performed to isolate the causal path. We identify that a key step is to align two executions before comparison. We propose to use a technique called execution indexing, whose goal is to establish a mapping between equivalent points in two different executions based on execution structure so that comparison can be meaningfully performed. We for- mally define the technique, identify and prove properties that are crucial to efficiency and efficacy. Experiments show that the proposed approach is able to compute high quality causal paths that explain failures, with reasonable cost.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of implicit information flow (IIF) on the Android bytecode is presented to identify all potential IIF forms, determine their exploitability, and mitigate the potential threat. By applying control-transfer-oriented semantic analysis of the bytecode language, we identify five IIF forms, some of which are not studied by existing IIF literature. We develop proof-of-concepts (PoCs) for each IIF form to demonstrate their exploitability. The experimental results show that all these PoCs can effectively and efficiently transmit sensitive data, as well as successfully evade the detection of a state-of-the-art privacy monitor TaintDroid. To mitigate the threat of IIF, we propose a solution to defending against IIF leveraging a special control dependence tracking technique and implement a prototype system. The evaluation shows that the prototype can effectively detect information leak by all the identified IIF forms and also real-world malware with an acceptable overhead. In summary, our study gives in-depth insight into Android IIF from both offensive and defensive perspectives, and provides a foundation for further research on Android IIF.",

They are highly valuable for forensic analysis that aims to identify the root cause of an attack, which may occur long ago, or to determine the ramifications of an attack for recovery from it. A key challenge of audit log-based forensics in practice is the sheer size of the log files generated, which could grow at a rate of Gigabytes per day. In this paper, we propose LogGC, an audit logging system with garbage collection (GC) capability. We identify and overcome the unique challenges of garbage collection in the context of computer forensic analysis, which makes LogGC different from traditional memory GC techniques. We also develop techniques that instrument user applications at a small number of selected places to emit additional system events so that we can substantially reduce the false dependences between system events to improve GC effectiveness. Our results show that LogGC can reduce audit log size by 14 times for regular user systems and 37 times for server systems, without affecting the accuracy of forensic analysis.",

Among them, some may require human interventions to operate, e.g., the manual specification of the parameters in the data processing programs, or otherwise, would behave poorly. We propose a novel framework called Autonomizer to autonomize these systems by installing the AI into the traditional programs. Autonomizeris general so it can be applied to many real-world applications. We provide the primitives and the run-time support, where the primitives abstract common tasks of autonomization and the runtime support realizes them transparently. With the support of Autonomizer, the users can gain the AI support with little engineering efforts. Like many other AI applications, the challenge lies in the feature selection, which we address by proposing multiple automated strategies based on the program analysis. Our experiment results on nine real-world applications show that the autonomization only requires adding a few lines to the source code.Besides, for the data-processing programs, Autonomizer improves the output quality by 161% on average over the default settings. For the interactive programs such as game/driving,Autonomizer achieves higher success rate with lower training time than existing autonomized programs.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Program input syntactic structure is essential for a wide range of applications such as test case generation, software debugging, and network security. However, such important information is often not available (e.g., most malware programs make use of secret protocols to communicate) or not directly usable by machines (e.g., many programs specify their inputs in plain text or other random formats). Furthermore, many programs claim they accept inputs with a published format, but their implementations actually support a subset or a variant. Based on the observations that input structure is manifested by the way input symbols are used during execution and most programs take input with top-down or bottom-up grammars, we devise two dynamic analyses, one for each grammar category. Our evaluation on a set of real-world programs shows that our technique is able to precisely reverse engineer input syntactic structure from execution. We apply our technique to hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) and network protocol reverse engineering. Our technique enables the complete automation of HDD, in which programmers were originally required to provide input grammars, and improves the runtime performance of HDD. Our client study on network protocol reverse engineering also shows that our technique supersedes existing techniques.",

        "abstract": "The machine representation of floating point values has limited precision such that errors may be introduced during execution. These errors may get propagated and magnified by the following operations, leading to instability problems, e.g., control flow path may be undesirably altered and faulty output may be emitted. In this paper, we develop an on-the-fly efficient monitoring technique that can predict if an execution is stable. The technique does not explicitly compute errors as doing so incurs high overhead. Instead, it detects possible places where an error becomes substantially inflated regarding the corresponding value, and then tags the value with one bit to denote that it has an inflated error. It then tracks inflation bit propagation, taking care of operations that may cut off such propagation. It reports instability if any inflation bit reaches a critical execution point, such as a predicate, where the inflated error may induce substantial execution difference, such as different execution paths. Our experiment shows that with appropriate thresholds, the technique can correctly detect that over 99.999996% of the inputs of all the programs we studied are stable while a traditional technique relying solely on inflation detection mistakenly classifies majority of the inputs as unstable for some of the programs. Compared to the state of the art technique that is based on high precision computation and causes several hundred times slowdown, our technique only causes 7.91 times slowdown on average and can report all the true unstable executions with the appropriate thresholds.",

        "abstract": "Many efforts have been paid to enhance the security of Android. However, less attention has been given to how to practically adopt the enhancements on off-the-shelf devices. In particular, securing Android devices often requires modifying their write-protected underlying system component files (especially the system libraries) by flashing or rooting devices, which is unacceptable in many realistic cases. In this paper, a novel technique, called reference hijacking, is presented to address the problem. By introducing a specially designed reset procedure, a new execution environment is constructed for the target application, in which the reference to the underlying system libraries will be redirected to the security-enhanced alternatives. The technique can be applicable to both the Dalvik and Android Runtime (ART) environments and to almost all mainstream Android versions (2.x to 5.x). To demonstrate the capability of reference hijacking, we develop three prototype systems, PatchMan, ControlMan, and TaintMan, to enforce specific security enhancements, involving patching vulnerabilities, protecting inter-component communications, and performing dynamic taint analysis for the target application. These three prototypes have been successfully deployed on a number of popular Android devices from different manufacturers, without modifying the underlying system. The evaluation results show that they are effective and do not introduce noticeable overhead. They strongly support that reference hijacking can substantially improve the practicability of many security enhancement efforts for Android.",

        "title": "Automatic Protocol Format Reverse Engineering through Context-Aware Monitored Execution",
        "abstract": "Protocol reverse engineering has often been a manual process that is considered time-consuming, tedious and error-prone. To address this limitation, a number of solu- tions have recently been proposed to allow for automatic protocol reverse engineering. Unfortunately, they are ei- ther limited in extracting protocol fields due to lack of pro- gram semantics in network traces or primitive in only re- vealing the flat structure of protocol format. In this paper, we present a system called AutoFormat that aims at not only extracting protocol fields with high accuracy, but also re- vealing the inherently \"non-flat\", hierarchical structures of protocol messages. AutoFormat is based on the key insight that different protocol fields in the same message are typi- cally handled in different execution contexts (e.g., the run- time call stack). As such, by monitoring the program exe- cution, we can collect the execution context information for every message byte (annotated with its offset in the entire message) and cluster them to derive the protocol format. We have evaluated our system with more than 30 protocol mes- sages from seven protocols, including two text-based proto- cols (HTTP and SIP), three binary-based protocols (DHCP, RIP, and OSPF), one hybrid protocol (CIFS/SMB), as well as one unknown protocol used by a real-world malware. OurresultsshowthatAutoFormatcannotonlyidentifyindi- vidual message fields automatically and with high accuracy (an average 93.4% match ratio compared with Wireshark), but also unveil the structure of the protocol format by re- vealing possible relations (e.g., sequential, parallel, and hi- erarchical) among the message fields.",

However, such important information is often not available (e.g., most malware programs make use of secret protocols to communicate) or not directly usable by machines (e.g., many programs specify their inputs in plain text or other random formats). Furthermore, many programs claim they accept inputs with a published format, but their implementations actually support a subset or a variant. Based on the observations that input structure is manifested by the way input symbols are used during execution and most programs take input with top-down or bottom-up grammars, we devise two dynamic analyses, one for each grammar category. Our evaluation on a set of real-world programs shows that our technique is able to precisely reverse engineer input syntactic structure from execution.",

Doing so, the space complexity is bounded by memory footprint instead of execution length. Moreover, presenting dependences between memory locations is often more desirable for human inspection during debugging as redundant dependences are suppressed.

It has a wide range of applications in debugging, regression testing, program comprehension, and security. Meaningful comparison demands that executions are aligned before they are compared, otherwise the resulting differences do not reflect semantic differences. Prior work has focused on aligning executions along the control flow dimension. In this paper, we observe that the memory dimension is also critical and propose a novel solution to align memory locations across different executions. We introduce a canonical representation for memory locations and pointer values called memory indexing. Aligned memory locations across runs share the same index. We formally define the semantics of memory indexing and present a cost-effective design. We also show that memory indexing overcomes an important challenge in automated debugging by enabling robust state replacement across runs.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in automated reasoning about programming assignments at scale is clustering student submissions based on their underlying algorithms. State-of-the-art clustering techniques are sensitive to control structure variations, cannot cluster buggy solutions with similar correct solutions, and either require expensive pair-wise program analyses or training efforts. We propose a novel technique that can cluster small imperative programs based on their algorithmic essence: (A) how the input space is partitioned into equivalence classes and (B) how the problem is uniquely addressed within individual equivalence classes. We capture these algorithmic aspects as two quantitative semantic program features that are merged into a program's vector representation. Programs are then clustered using their vector representations. The computation of our first semantic feature leverages model counting to identify the number of inputs belonging to an input equivalence class. The computation of our second semantic feature abstracts the program's data flow by tracking the number of occurrences of a unique pair of consecutive values of a variable during its lifetime. The comprehensive evaluation of our tool SemCluster on benchmarks drawn from solutions to small programming assignments shows that SemCluster (1) generates far fewer clusters than other clustering techniques, (2) precisely identifies distinct solution strategies, and (3) boosts the performance of clustering-based program repair, all within a reasonable amount of time.\n\n",

        "abstract": "While smartphones and mobile apps have been an essential part of our lives, privacy is a serious concern. Previous mobile privacy related research efforts have largely focused on predefined known sources managed by smartphones. Sensitive user inputs through UI (User Interface), another information source that may contain a lot of sensitive information, have been mostly neglected. In this paper, we examine the possibility of scalably detecting sensitive user inputs from mobile apps. In particular, we design and implement SUPOR, a novel static analysis tool that automatically examines the UIs to identify sensitive user inputs containing critical user data, such as user credentials, finance, and medical data. SUPOR enables existing privacy analysis approaches to be applied on sensitive user inputs as well. To demonstrate the usefulness of SUPOR, we build a system that detects privacy disclosures of sensitive user inputs by combining SUPOR with off-the-shelf static taint analysis We apply the system to 16,000 popular Android apps, and conduct a measurement study on the privacy disclosures. SUPOR achieves an average precision of 97.3% and an average recall of 97.3% for sensitive user input identification. SUPOR finds 355 apps with privacy disclosures and the false positive rate is 8.7%. We discover interesting cases related to national ID, username/password, credit card and health information.",

        "title": "Locating faults through automated predicate switching",
        "abstract": "Typically debugging begins when during a program execution a point is reached at which an obviously incorrect value is observed. A general and powerful approach to automated debugging can be based upon identifying modifications to the program state that will bring the execution to a successful conclusion. However, searching for arbitrary changes to the program state is difficult due to the extremely large search space. In this paper we demonstrate that by forcibly switching a predicate's outcome at runtime and altering the control flow, the program state can not only be inexpensively modified, but in addition it is often possible to bring the program execution to a successful completion (i.e., program produces the desired output). By examining the switched predicate, also called the critical predicate, the cause of the bug can then be identified. Since the outcome of a branch can only be either true or false, the number of modified states resulting by predicate switching is far less than those possible through arbitrary state changes. Thus, it is possible to automatically search through modified states to find one that leads to the correct output. We have developed an implementation based upon dynamic instrumentation to perform this search through program re-execution -- the program is executed from the beginning and a predicate's outcome is switched to produce the desired change in control flow. To evaluate our approach, we tried our technique on several reported bugs for a number of UNIX utility programs. Our technique was found to be practical (i.e., acceptable in time taken) and effective (i.e., we were able to automatically identify critical predicates). Moreover we show that bidirectional dynamic slices of critical predicates capture the faulty code.",

        "abstract": "Tracing the lineage of data is an important requirement for establishing the quality and validity of data. Recently, the problem of data provenance has been increasingly addressed in database research. Earlier work has been limited to the lineage of data as it is manipulated using relational operations within an RDBMS. While this captures a very important aspect of scientific data processing, the existing work is incapable of handling the equally important, and prevalent, cases where the data is processed by non-relational operations. This is particularly common in scientific data where sophisticated processing is achieved by programs that are not part of a DBMS. The problem of tracking lineage when non-relational operators are used to process the data is particularly challenging since there is potentially no constraint on the nature of the processing. In this paper we propose a novel technique that overcomes this significant barrier and enables the tracing of lineage of data generated by an arbitrary function. Our technique works directly with the executable code of the function and does not require any high-level description of the function or even the source code. We establish the feasibility of our approach on a typical application and demonstrate that the technique is able to discern the correct lineage. Furthermore, it is shown that the method can help identify limitations in the function itself.",

        "abstract": "An Android app's graphical user interface (GUI) displays rich semantic and contextual information about the smartphone's owner and app's execution. Such information provides vital clues to the investigation of crimes in both cyber and physical spaces. In real-world digital forensics however, once an electronic device becomes evidence most manual interactions with it are prohibited by criminal investigation protocols. Hence investigators must resort to \\\"image-and-analyze\\\" memory forensics (instead of browsing through the subject phone) to recover the apps' GUIs. Unfortunately, GUI reconstruction is still largely impossible with state-of-the-art memory forensics techniques, which tend to focus only on individual in-memory data structures. An Android GUI, however, displays diverse visual elements each built from numerous data structure instances. Furthermore, whenever an app is sent to the background, its GUI structure will be explicitly deallocated and disintegrated by the Android framework. In this paper, we present GUITAR, an app-independent technique which automatically reassembles and redraws all apps' GUIs from the multitude of GUI data elements found in a smartphone's memory image. To do so, GUITAR involves the reconstruction of (1) GUI tree topology, (2) drawing operation mapping, and (3) runtime environment for redrawing. Our evaluation shows that GUITAR is highly accurate (80-95% similar to original screenshots) at reconstructing GUIs from memory images taken from a variety of Android apps on popular phones. Moreover, GUITAR is robust in reconstructing meaningful GUIs even when facing GUI data loss.",

        "abstract": "Performance bugs are frequently observed in commodity software. While profilers or source code-based tools can be used at development stage where a program is diagnosed in a well-defined environment, many performance bugs survive such a stage and affect production runs. OS kernel-level tracers are commonly used in post-development diagnosis due to their independence from programs and libraries; however, they lack detailed program-specific metrics to reason about performance problems such as function latencies and program contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel performance inference system, called IntroPerf, that generates fine-grained performance information -- like that from application profiling tools -- transparently by leveraging OS tracers that are widely available in most commodity operating systems. With system stack traces as input, IntroPerf enables transparent context-sensitive performance inference, and diagnoses application performance in a multi-layered scope ranging from user functions to the kernel. Evaluated with various performance bugs in multiple open source software projects, IntroPerf automatically ranks potential internal and external root causes of performance bugs with high accuracy without any prior knowledge about or instrumentation on the subject software. Our results show IntroPerf's effectiveness as a lightweight performance introspection tool for post-development diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "ARM is the leading processor architecture in the emerging mobile and embedded market. Unfortunately, there has been a myriad of security issues on both mobile and embedded systems. While many countermeasures of such security issues have been proposed in recent years, a majority of applications still cannot be patched or protected due to run-time and space overhead constraints and the unavailability of source code. More importantly, the rapidly evolving mobile and embedded market makes any platform-specific solution ineffective. In this paper, we propose RevARM, a binary rewriting technique capable of instrumenting ARM-based binaries without limitation on the target platform. Unlike many previous binary instrumentation tools that are designed to instrument binaries based on x86, RevARM must resolve a number of new, ARM-specific binary rewriting challenges. Moreover, RevARM is able to handle stripped binaries, requires no symbolic/semantic information, and supports Mach-O binaries, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of RevARM in solving real-world security challenges. Our evaluation results across a variety of platforms, including popular mobile and embedded systems, show that RevARM is highly effective in instrumenting ARM binaries with an average of 3.2% run-time and 1.3% space overhead.",

        "abstract": "Currently cyber infrastructures are facing increasingly stealthy attacks that implant malicious payloads under the cover of benign programs. Existing attack detection approaches based on statistical learning methods may generate misleading decision boundaries when processing noisy data with such a mixture of benign and malicious behaviors. On the other hand, attack detection based on formal program analysis may lack completeness or adaptivity when modelling attack behaviors. In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data. Our extensive evaluation shows that, compared with pure statistical learning models, LEAPS achieves consistently higher accuracy when detecting real-world camouflaged attacks with benign program cover-up.",

        "abstract": "The Android research community has long focused on building an Android API permission specification, which can be leveraged by app developers to determine the optimum set of permissions necessary for a correct and safe execution of their app. However, while prominent existing efforts provide a good approximation of the permission specification, they suffer from a few shortcomings. Dynamic approaches cannot generate complete results, although accurate for the particular execution. In contrast, static approaches provide better coverage, but produce imprecise mappings due to their lack of path-sensitivity. In fact, in light of Android's access control complexity, the approximations hardly abstract the actual co-relations between enforced protections. To address this, we propose to precisely derive Android protection specification in a path-sensitive fashion, using a novel graph abstraction technique. We further showcase how we can apply the generated maps to tackle security issues through logical satisfiability reasoning. Our constructed maps for 4 Android Open Source Project (AOSP) images highlight the significance of our approach, as ~41% of APIs' protections cannot be correctly modeled without our technique.\n\n",

Traditional methods tend to treat a program as a blackbox. In this paper, we show that through program analysis, we can expose the internals of sample executions so that the process can become more selective and focused. In particular, we develop a sampling runtime that can selectively sample in input error bounds to expose discontinuity in output functions. It identifies all the program factors that can potentially lead to discontinuity and hash the values of such factors during execution in a cost-effective way. The hash values are used to guide the sampling process. Our results show that the technique is very effective for real-world programs.

        "abstract": "Debugging concurrent programs is difficult. This is primarily because the inherent non-determinism that arises because of scheduler interleavings makes it hard to easily reproduce bugs that may manifest only under certain interleavings. The problem is exacerbated in multi-core environments where there are multiple schedulers, one for each core. In this paper, we propose a reproduction technique for concurrent programs that execute on multi-core platforms. Our technique performs a lightweight analysis of a failing execution that occurs in a multi-core environment, and uses the result of the analysis to enable reproduction of the bug in a single-core system, under the control of a deterministic scheduler. More specifically, our approach automatically identifies the execution point in the re-execution that corresponds to the failure point. It does so by analyzing the failure core dump and leveraging a technique called execution indexing that identifies a related point in the re-execution. By generating a core dump at this point, and comparing the differences betwen the two dumps, we are able to guide a search algorithm to efficiently generate a failure inducing schedule. Our experiments show that our technique is highly effective and has reasonable overhead.",

Most applications perform expensive stack walking to recover contexts. The resulting contexts are often explicitly represented as a sequence of call sites and hence bulky. We propose a technique to encode the current calling context of any point during an execution. In particular, an acyclic call path is encoded into one number through only integer additions. Recursive call paths are divided into acyclic subsequences and encoded independently. We leverage stack depth in a safe way to optimize encoding: if a calling context can be safely and uniquely identified by its stack depth, we do not perform encoding. We propose an algorithm to seamlessly fuse encoding and stack depth based identification. The algorithm is safe because different contexts are guaranteed to have different IDs. It also ensures contexts can be faithfully decoded. Our experiments show that our technique incurs negligible overhead (1.89% on average). For most medium-sized programs, it can encode all contexts with just one number. For large programs, we are able to encode most calling contexts to a few numbers.",

        "abstract": "Since their introduction, path profiles have been used toguide the application of aggressive code optimizations andperforming instruction scheduling. However, for optimizationand scheduling, it is often desirable to obtain frequencycounts of paths that extend across loop iterations and crossprocedure boundaries. These longer paths, referred to asinteresting paths in this paper, account for over 75% of theflow in a subset of SPEC benchmarks. Although the frequencycounts of interesting paths can be estimated frompath profiles, the degree of imprecision of these estimates isvery high. We extend Ball Larus (BL) paths to create slightlylonger overlapping paths and develop an instrumentationalgorithm to collect their frequencies. While these pathsare slightly longer than BL paths, they enable very preciseestimation of frequencies of potentially much longer interestingpaths. Our experiments show that the average cost ofcollecting frequencies of overlapping paths is 86.8% whichis 4.2 times that of BL paths. However, while the averageimprecision in estimated total flow of interesting paths derivedfrom BL path frequencies ranges from -38 % to +138%, the average imprecision in flow estimates derived fromoverlapping path frequencies ranges only from -4% to +8%.",

It determines whether an event e is causally dependent on a preceding event c during execution. We develop a new causality inference engine LDX. Given an execution, it spawns a slave execution, in which it mutates c and observes whether any change is induced at e. To preclude non-determinism, LDX couples the executions by sharing syscall outcomes. To handle path differences induced by the perturbation, we develop a novel on-the-fly execution alignment scheme that maintains a counter to reflect the progress of execution. The scheme relies on program analysis and compiler transformation. LDX can effectively detect information leak and security attacks with an average overhead of 6.08% while running the master and the slave concurrently on separate CPUs, much lower than existing systems that require instruction level monitoring. Furthermore, it has much better accuracy in causality inference.",

        "abstract": "Remote code execution (RCE) attacks are one of the most prominent security threats for web applications. It is a special kind of cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack that allows client inputs to be stored and executed as server side scripts. RCE attacks often require coordination of multiple requests and manipulation of string and non-string inputs from the client side to nullify the access control protocol and induce unusual execution paths on the server side. We propose a path- and context-sensitive interprocedural analysis to detect RCE vulnerabilities. The analysis features a novel way of analyzing both the string and non-string behavior of a web application in a path sensitive fashion. It thoroughly handles the practical challenges entailed by modeling RCE attacks. We develop a prototype system and evaluate it on ten real-world PHP applications.

        "title": "Supporting fine-grained database lineage tracking",
        "abstract": "Lineage, which records the origin of the data and the process by which the data are derived, is critical for many applications. This dissertation addresses several shortcomings of databases for supporting fine-grained lineage. First, frequent updates complicate lineage tracing. Since the data derivation may be expensive, changes in base data are not always propagated to the derived data immediately. This leads to an inconsistent state in the data and to stale lineage. We propose tracing lineage with multiple versions of data. Maintaining multiple versions of the data and their fine-grained lineage ensures that the lineage is always correct. Moreover, current methods trace lineage backward at users' requests and the lineage then, is not stored. To enable ad hoc queries over lineage, we advocate tracing lineage for all data and storing lineage in databases. Unfortunately, the current backward tracing approach is not efficient for tracing lineage for all data. To address this problem, we formally define forward lineage and prove its properties. We propose new query rewriting algorithms for Selection-Projection-Join (SPJ) and Aggregation-Selection-Projection (ASPJ) queries. In addition, our technique handles bag semantics, aggregations and nested sub-queries efficiently. Further, most current techniques focus on tracing internal fine-grained lineage where data is produced by a set of well-defined relational operators. As data is often processed outside databases, tracing lineage of the data produced by a black box function is inherently difficult. We propose a novel approach that instruments the binary code to enable external lineage tracing. This method is superior to prior work in that it is automatic and does not require any domain knowledge. We have implemented our techniques based on PostgreSQL and established the validity of the methods by testing with real data: We support new queries through materialized lineage; the forward method for tracing internal lineage incurs a low overhead for tracing all data lineage; the external lineage tracing technique has been used in a real scientific application and was found to be highly beneficial to our collaborators. Our techniques have broadened the scope of lineage, improved the quality of lineage, and enhanced the efficiency of tracing lineage.",

We propose three detection schemes that rely on syntactic fingerprinting to detect plagiarized applications under different levels of obfuscation used by the attacker.

        "abstract": "Effectively migrating sequential applications to take advantage of parallelism available on multicore platforms is a well-recognized challenge. This paper addresses important aspects of this issue by proposing a novel profiling technique to automatically detect available concurrency in C programs. The profiler, called Alchemist, operates completely transparently to applications, and identifies constructs at various levels of granularity (e.g., loops, procedures, and conditional statements) as candidates for asynchronous execution. Various dependences including read-after-write (RAW), write-after-read (WAR), and write-after-write (WAW), are detected between a construct and its continuation, the execution following the completion of the construct. The time-ordered distance between program points forming a dependence gives a measure of the effectiveness of parallelizing that construct, as well as identifying the transformations necessary to facilitate such parallelization. Using the notion of post-dominance, our profiling algorithm builds an execution index tree at run-time. This tree is used to differentiate among multiple instances of the same static construct, and leads to improved accuracy in the computed profile, useful to better identify constructs that are amenable to parallelization. Performance results indicate that the profiles generated by Alchemist pinpoint strong candidates for parallelization, and can help significantly ease the burden of application migration to multicore environments.",

In the event that adversaries have gained access to a system storing classified data, such crucial systems should actively protect the integrity of this data. To purposely deceive an attacker, we propose that accesses to sensitive data can be  dynamically partitioned  to prevent malicious tampering. In this paper, we present G emini , a virtualization-based system to transparently redirect accesses to classified files based on the context of the access (e.g., process, user, time-of-day, etc.). If an access violates preconfigured data-use policies then it will be rerouted to a  honey  version of the file, specifically crafted to be manipulated by the adversary. Thus, G emini  transforms static, sensitive files into moving targets and provides strong transparency and tamper-resistance as it is located at the hypervisor level. Our evaluation shows that G emini  effectively neutralizes several real-world attacks on various sensitive files and can be integrated seamlessly into current cloud environments.",

        "abstract": "Android smartphones are becoming increasingly popular. The open nature of Android allows users to install miscellaneous applications, including the malicious ones, from third-party marketplaces without rigorous sanity checks. A large portion of existing malwares perform stealthy operations such as sending short messages, making phone calls and HTTP connections, and installing additional malicious components. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to detect such stealthy behavior. We model stealthy behavior as the program behavior that mismatches with user interface, which denotes the user's expectation of program behavior. We use static program analysis to attribute a top level function that is usually a user interaction function with the behavior it performs. Then we analyze the text extracted from the user interface component associated with the top level function. Semantic mismatch of the two indicates stealthy behavior. To evaluate AsDroid, we download a pool of 182 apps that are potentially problematic by looking at their permissions. Among the 182 apps, AsDroid reports stealthy behaviors in 113 apps, with 28 false positives and 11 false negatives.",

        "abstract": "Advanced cyber attacks consist of multiple stages aimed at being stealthy and elusive. Such attack patterns leave their footprints spatio-temporally dispersed across many different logs in victim machines. However, existing log-mining intrusion analysis systems typically target only a single type of log to discover evidence of an attack and therefore fail to exploit fundamental inter-log connections. The output of such single-log analysis can hardly reveal the complete attack story for complex, multi-stage attacks. Additionally, some existing approaches require heavyweight system instrumentation, which makes them impractical to deploy in real production environments. To address these problems, we present HERCULE, an automated multi-stage log-based intrusion analysis system. Inspired by graph analytics research in social network analysis, we model multi-stage intrusion analysis as a community discovery problem. HERCULE builds multi-dimensional weighted graphs by correlating log entries across multiple lightweight logs that are readily available on commodity systems. From these, HERCULE discovers any \\\"attack communities\\\" embedded within the graphs. Our evaluation with 15 well known APT attack families demonstrates that HERCULE can reconstruct attack behaviors from a spectrum of cyber attacks that involve multiple stages with high accuracy and low false positive rates.",

The perturbations are safe as they respect the semantics of the program. We use a checkpointing/logging mechanism to capture a program execution to an event log. If the execution results in a failure, the framework automatically searches for perturbation of the execution by altering the event log and replaying the execution using the altered log to avoid the failure. If found, the perturbation is recorded as a dynamic patch, which is later applied by all future executions of this application to prevent the failure from occurring again. Our experiments show that the proposed framework is very effective in avoiding concurrency faults, heap memory overflow faults, and malicious requests. The entailed overhead for normal execution is very low (2-18%).",

In this work, we purpose a generic security framework, termed BlueBox, capable of detecting and handling a variety of cyber-physical attacks. To demonstrate an application of BlueBox in practice, we retrofitted an off-the-shelf quadcopter. A series of attacks were then launched by embedding malicious code in the control software and by altering the vehicleu0027s hardware with the specific targeting of sensors, controller, motors, vehicle dynamics, and operating system. Experimental results verified that BlueBox was capable of both detecting a variety of cyber-physical attacks, while also providing the means in which to recover from such attacks.",

        "abstract": "Program variables used in robotic and cyber-physical systems often have implicit physical units that cannot be determined from their variable types. Inferring an abstract physical unit type for variables and checking their physical unit type consistency is of particular importance for validating the correctness of such systems. For instance, a variable with the unit of \u2018meter\u2019 should not be assigned to another variable with the unit of \u2018degree-per-second\u2019. Existing solutions have various limitations such as requiring developers to annotate variables with physical units and only handling variables that are directly or transitively used in popular robotic libraries with known physical unit information. We observe that there are a lot of physical unit hints in these softwares such as variable names and specific forms of expressions. These hints have uncertainty as developers may not respect conventions. We propose to model them with probability distributions and conduct probabilistic inference. At the end, our technique produces a unit distribution for each variable. Unit inconsistencies can then be detected using the highly probable unit assignments. Experimental results on 30 programs show that our technique can infer units for 159.3% more variables compared to the state-of-the-art with more than 88.7% true positives, and inconsistencies detection on 90 programs shows that our technique reports 103.3% more inconsistencies with 85.3% true positives.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Software vulnerabilities are the root cause of a wide range of attacks. Existing vulnerability scanning tools are able to produce a set of suspects. However, they often suffer from a high false positive rate. Convicting a suspect and vindicating false positives are mostly a highly demanding manual process, requiring a certain level of understanding of the software. This limitation significantly thwarts the application of these tools by system administrators or regular users who are concerned about security but lack of understanding of, or even access to, the source code. It is often the case that even developers are reluctant to inspect/fix these numerous suspects unless they are convicted by evidence. In this paper, we propose a lightweight dynamic approach which generates evidence for various security vulnerabilities in software, with the goal of relieving the manual procedure. It is based on data lineage tracing, a technique that associates each execution point precisely with a set of relevant input values. These input values can be mutated by an offline analysis to generate exploits. We overcome the efficiency challenge by using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD). Our tool successfully generates exploits for all the known vulnerabilities we studied. We also use it to uncover a number of new vulnerabilities, proved by evidence.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing concern of the security on high performance multiprocessor enterprise servers, more and more effort is being invested into defending against various kinds of attacks. This paper proposes a security enhancement model called SENSS, that allows programs to run securely on a symmetric shared memory multiprocessor (SMP) environment. In SENSS, a program, including both code and data, is stored in the shared memory in encrypted form but is decrypted once it is fetched into any of the processors. In contrast to the traditional uniprocessor XOM model (Lie et al., 2000), the main challenge in developing SENSS lies in the necessity for guarding the clear text communication between processors in a multiprocessor environment. In this paper we propose an inexpensive solution that can effectively protect the shared bus communication. The proposed schemes include both encryption and authentication for bus transactions. We develop a scheme that utilizes the cipher block chaining mode of the advanced encryption standard (CBC-AES) to achieve ultra low latency for the shared bus encryption and decryption. In addition, CBC-AES can generate integrity checking code for the bus communication over time, achieving bus authentication. Further, we develop techniques to ensure the cryptographic computation throughput meets the high bandwidth of gigabyte buses. We performed full system simulation using Simics to measure the overhead of the security features on a SMP system with a snooping write invalidate cache coherence protocol. Overall, only a slight performance degradation of 2.03% on average was observed when the security is provided at the highest level.",

Analyzing them is as important as analyzing the software itself. However, analyzing libraries is highly challenging due to the lack of source code, implementation in different languages, and complex optimizations. We observe that many Java library functions provide excellent documentation, which concisely describes the functionalities of the functions. We develop a novel technique that can construct models for Java API functions by analyzing the documentation. These models are simpler implementations in Java compared to the original ones and hence easier to analyze. More importantly, they provide the same functionalities as the original functions.

        "title": "Locating faulty code by multiple points slicing",
        "abstract": "Dynamic slicing has long been considered as a useful tool for debugging programs as it effectively identifies a reduced fault candidate set which captures the faulty code in the program. Traditionally, a backward dynamic slice is computed starting from an incorrect value observed by the programmer during a failed program run. This incorrect value is either an incorrect output value or an incorrect address whose dereferencing causes the program to crash. Recently we proposed two additional types of dynamic slices, a forward dynamic slice of a minimal failure inducing input difference and a bidirectional dynamic slice of a critical predicate. We have built a dynamic slicing tool that computes dynamic slices by instrumenting program binaries and executing them to build dynamic dependence graphs. In this paper, through experiments, we demonstrate that supporting three different types of dynamic slices has the following advantages. First, we observe that for each type of dynamic slice there are distinct situations in which it is not applicable. Therefore, we should support multiple types of slices to handle a wide range of situations. Second, supporting multiple types of dynamic slices enables us to compute a multiple points dynamic slice which is the intersection of different type of available slices. Our experiments show that multiple points dynamic slices are significantly smaller than any of the three kinds of individual dynamic slices. Copyright \u00a9 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Disassembling stripped binaries is a prominent challenge for binary analysis, due to the interleaving of code segments and data, and the difficulties of resolving control transfer targets of indirect calls and jumps. As a result, most existing disassemblers have both false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN). We observe that uncertainty is inevitable in disassembly due to the information loss during compilation and code generation. Therefore, we propose to model such uncertainty using probabilities and propose a novel disassembly technique, which computes a probability for each address in the code space, indicating its likelihood of being a true positive instruction. The probability is computed from a set of features that are reachable to an address, including control flow and data flow features. Our experiments with more than two thousands binaries show that our technique does not have any FN and has only 3.7% FP. In comparison, a state-of-the-art superset disassembly technique has 85% FP. A rewriter built on our disassembly can generate binaries that are only half of the size of those by superset disassembly and run 3% faster. While many widely-used disassemblers such as IDA and BAP suffer from missing function entries, our experiment also shows that even without any function entry information, our disassembler can still achieve 0 FN and 6.8% FP.\n\n",

Consequently, during execution, errors are introduced, propagated, and accumulated, leading to unreliable outputs. We call this the instability problem.

RAIVE transforms every floating point value to a vector of multiple values \u2013 the values added to create the vector are obtained by introducing artifi- cial errors that are upper bounds of actual errors. The propagation of artificial errors models the propagation of actual errors. When values in vectors result in discrete execution differences (e.g., following different paths), the execution is forked to capture the resulting output variations. Our evaluation shows that RAIVE can precisely capture output variations. Its overhead (340%) is 2.43 times lower than the state of the art",

        "abstract": "Several diagnostic tracing techniques (e.g., event, power, and control-flow tracing) have been proposed for run-time debugging and postmortem analysis of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Traces generated by such techniques can become large, defying the harsh resource constraints of WSNs. Compression is a straightforward candidate to reduce trace sizes, yet is challenged by the same resource constraints. Established trace compression algorithms perform unsatisfactorily under these constraints. We propose Prius, a novel hybrid (offline/online) trace compression technique that enables application of established trace compression algorithms for WSNs and achieves high compression rates and significant energy savings. We have implemented such hybrid versions of two established compression techniques for TinyOS and evaluated them on various applications. Prius respects the resource constraints of WSNs (5% average program memory overhead) whilst reducing energy consumption on average by 46% and 49% compared to straightforward online adaptations of established compression algorithms and the state-of-the-art trace-specific compression algorithm respectively.",

Given two executions and some observed differences between them, the technique reasons about the causes of such differences. The technique does so by state replacement, i.e. replacing part of the program state at an earlier point to observe whether the target differences can be induced. It makes a number of key advances: it features a novel execution model that avoids undesirable entangling of the replaced state and the original state; it properly handles differences of omission by symmetrically analyzing both executions; it also leverages a recently developed slicing technique to limit the scope of causality testing while ensuring that no relevant state causes can be missed. The application of the technique on automated debugging shows that it substantially improves the precision and efficiency of causal inference compared to state of the art techniques. \n\n",

Existing techniques either rely on recording very fine grained execution information and hence have high runtime overhead, or strive to log as little information as possible but provide no guarantee in reproducing a bug. We present Light, a technique that features much lower overhead compared to techniques based on fine grained recording, and that guarantees to reproduce concurrent bugs. We leverage and formally prove that recording flow dependences is the necessary and sufficient condition to reproduce a concurrent bug. The flow dependences, together with the thread local orders that can be automatically inferred (and hence not logged), are encoded as scheduling constraints. An SMT solver is used to derive a replay schedule, which is guaranteed to exist even though it may be different from the original schedule. Our experiments show that Light has only 44% logging overhead, almost one order of magnitude lower than the state of the art techniques relying on logging memory accesses. Its space overhead is only 10% of those techniques. Light can also reproduce all the bugs we have collected whereas existing techniques miss some of them.",

        "abstract": "Adversarial sample attacks perturb benign inputs to induce DNN misbehaviors. Recent research has demonstrated the widespread presence and the devastating consequences of such attacks. Existing defense techniques either assume prior knowledge of specific attacks or may not work well on complex models due to their underlying assumptions. We argue that adversarial sample attacks are deeply entangled with interpretability of DNN models: while classification results on benign inputs can be reasoned based on the human perceptible features/attributes, results on adversarial samples can hardly be explained. Therefore, we propose a novel adversarial sample detection technique for face recognition models, based on interpretability. It features a novel bi-directional causality inference between attributes and internal neurons to identify neurons critical for individual attributes. The activation values of critical neurons are enhanced to amplify the reasoning part of the computation and the values of other neurons are weakened to suppress the gut-feeling part. The classification results after such transformation are compared with those of the original model to detect adversaries. Results show that our technique can achieve 94% detection accuracy for 7 different kinds of attacks with 9.91% false positives on benign inputs. In contrast, a state-of-the-art feature squeezing technique can only achieve 55% accuracy with 23.3% false positives.",

        "abstract": "Test adequacy criteria are fundamental in software testing. Among them, code coverage criterion is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, in dynamic web application testing, merely covering server-side script code is inadequate because it neglects client-side execution, which plays an important role in triggering client-server interactions to reach important execution states. Similarly, a criterion aiming at covering the UI elements on client-side pages ignores the server-side execution, leading to insufficiency. In this paper, we propose Virtual DOM (V-DOM) Coverage, a novel criterion, for effective web application testing. With static analysis, we first aggregate all the DOM objects that may be produced by a piece of server script to construct a V-DOM tree. The tree models execution on both the client- and server-sides such that V-DOM coverage is more effective than existing coverage criteria in web application testing. We conduct an empirical study on five real world dynamic web applications. We find that V-DOM tree can model much more DOM objects than a web crawling based technique. Test selection based on V-DOM tree criterion substantially outperforms the existing code coverage and UI element coverage, by detecting more faults.",

        "abstract": "Different types of program profiles (control flow, value, address, and dependence) have been collected and extensively studied by researchers to identify program characteristics that can then be exploited to develop more effective compilers and architectures. Because of the large amounts of profile data produced by realistic program runs, most work has focused on separately collecting and compressing different types of profiles. In this paper, we present a unified representation of profiles called Whole Execution Trace (WET), which includes the complete information contained in each of the above types of traces. Thus, WETs provide a basis for a next-generation software tool that will enable mining of program profiles to identify program characteristics that require understanding of relationships among various types of profiles. The key features of our WET representation are: WET is constructed by labeling a static program representation with profile information such that relevant and related profile information can be directly accessed by analysis algorithms as they traverse the representation; a highly effective two-tier strategy is used to significantly compress the WET; and compression techniques are designed such that they minimally affect the ability to rapidly traverse WET for extracting subsets of information corresponding to individual profile types as well as a combination of profile types. Our experimentation shows that on, an average, execution traces resulting from execution of 647 million statements can be stored in 331 megabytes of storage after compression. The compression factors range from 16 to 83. Moreover the rates at which different types of profiles can be individually or simultaneously extracted are high. We present two applications of WETs, dynamic program slicing and dynamic version matching, which make effective use of multiple kinds of profile information contained in WETs.",

        "abstract": "Data provenance tracking determines the set of inputs related to a given output. It enables quality control and problem diagnosis in data engineering. Most existing techniques work by tracking program dependencies. They cannot quantitatively assess the importance of related inputs, which is critical to machine learning algorithms, in which an output tends to depend on a huge set of inputs while only some of them are of importance. In this paper, we propose LAMP, a provenance computation system for machine learning algorithms. Inspired by automatic differentiation (AD), LAMP quantifies the importance of an input for an output by computing the partial derivative. LAMP separates the original data processing and the more expensive derivative computation to different processes to achieve cost-effectiveness. In addition, it allows quantifying importance for inputs related to discrete behavior, such as control flow selection. The evaluation on a set of real world programs and data sets illustrates that LAMP produces more precise and succinct provenance than program dependence based techniques, with much less overhead. Our case studies demonstrate the potential of LAMP in problem diagnosis in data engineering.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are hard to program due to unconventional programming models used to satisfy stringent resource constraints. The common event-driven concurrent programming model and lack of kernel protection in these systems introduce the possibility of several subtle faults such as race conditions. These faults are often triggered by unexpected interleavings of events in the real world, and can occur long after their causes. Reproducing a fault from the trace of the past events can play a crucial role in debugging such faults. The same tight constraints that motivate the specific programming model however make tracing challenging. This paper proposes an efficient intra-procedural and inter-procedural control-flow tracing algorithm that generates the traces of all interleaving concurrent events. Our approach enables reproducing faults at a later stage, allowing the programmer to identify them effectively. We argue for the accuracy of our approach through case studies, and illustrate its low overhead through measurements and simulations.",

        "abstract": "Calling contexts (CCs) are very important for a wide range of applications such as profiling, debugging, and event logging. Most applications perform expensive stack walking to recover contexts. The resulting contexts are often explicitly represented as a sequence of call sites and hence are bulky. We propose a technique to encode the current calling context of any point during an execution. In particular, an acyclic call path is encoded into one number through only integer additions. Recursive call paths are divided into acyclic subsequences and encoded independently. We leverage stack depth in a safe way to optimize encoding: If a calling context can be safely and uniquely identified by its stack depth, we do not perform encoding. We propose an algorithm to seamlessly fuse encoding and stack depth-based identification. The algorithm is safe because different contexts are guaranteed to have different IDs. It also ensures contexts can be faithfully decoded. Our experiments show that our technique incurs negligible overhead (0-6.4 percent). For most medium-sized programs, it can encode all contexts with just one number. For large programs, we are able to encode most calling contexts to a few numbers. We also present our experience of applying context encoding to debugging crash-based failures.",

        "abstract": "Execution comparison is becoming more common as a means of debugging faulty programs or simply explaining program behavior. Often, such as when debugging, the goal is to understand particular aspects of a single execution, and it is not immediately clear against what we should compare this execution. Prior work has led to approaches for acquiring a second execution, or peer, with which to compare the first. The earliest of these searched test suites for suitable candidates. More recent work focuses on synthesizing a new execution, either by generating new input for the program or by directly mutating the execution itself. In spite of these proposals, it is unclear what advantages these different techniques for finding peers might have over each other. In this paper, we implement five different existing techniques and examine their impact on 20 real bugs. These bugs represent the full set of reported bugs for three programs during one year. We present a metric to evaluate the quality of the peers. It is based on the similarity of the peers to the executions of the patched programs. We also discuss in detail the different scenarios where these techniques hold advantages.",

        "title": "Automated failure explanation through execution comparison",
        "abstract": "When fixing a bug in software, developers must build an understanding or explanation of the bug and how the bug flows through a program. The effort that developers must put into building this explanation is costly and laborious. Thus, developers need tools that can assist them in explaining the behavior of bugs. Dynamic slicing is one technique that can effectively show how a bug propagates through an execution up to the point where a program fails. However, dynamic slices are large because they do not just explain the bug itself; they include extra information that explains any observed behavior that might be connected to the bug. Thus, the explanation of the bug is hidden within this other tangentially related information. This dissertation addresses the problem and shows how a failing execution and a correct execution may be compared in order to construct explanations that include only information about what caused the bug. As a result, these automated explanations are significantly more concise than those explanations produced by existing dynamic slicing techniques. To enable the comparison of executions, we develop new techniques for dynamic analyses that identify the commonalities and differences between executions. First, we devise and implement the notion of a point within an execution that may exist across multiple executions. We also note that comparing executions involves comparing the state or variables and their values that exist within the executions at different execution points. Thus, we design an approach for identifying the locations of variables in different executions so that their values may be compared. Leveraging these tools, we design a system for identifying the behaviors within an execution that can be blamed for a bug and that together compose an explanation for the bug. These explanations are up to two orders of magnitude smaller than those produced by existing state of the art techniques. We also examine how different choices of a correct execution for comparison can impact the practicality or potential quality of the explanations produced via our system.",

        "abstract": "The ubiquity of modern smartphones means that nearly everyone has easy access to a camera at all times. In the event of a crime, the photographic evidence that these cameras leave in a smartphone's memory becomes vital pieces of digital evidence, and forensic investigators are tasked with recovering and analyzing this evidence. Unfortunately, few existing forensics tools are capable of systematically recovering and inspecting such in-memory photographic evidence produced by smartphone cameras. In this paper, we present VCR, a memory forensics technique which aims to fill this void by enabling the recovery of all photographic evidence produced by an Android device's cameras. By leveraging key aspects of the Android framework, VCR extends existing memory forensics techniques to improve vendor-customized Android memory image analysis. Based on this, VCR targets application-generic artifacts in an input memory image which allow photographic evidence to be collected no matter which application produced it. Further, VCR builds upon the Android framework's existing image decoding logic to both automatically recover and render any located evidence. Our evaluation with commercially available smartphones shows that VCR is highly effective at recovering all forms of photographic evidence produced by a variety of applications across several different Android platforms.",

        "abstract": "Kernel drivers are usually provided in the form of loadable kernel extensions, which can be loaded/unloaded dynamically at runtime and execute with the same privilege as the core operating system kernel. The unrestricted security access from the drivers to the kernel is nevertheless a double-edged sword that makes them susceptible targets of trojan attacks. Given a benign driver, it is now easy to implant malicious logic with existing hacking tools. Once implanted, such malicious logic is difficult to detect. In this paper we propose DRIP, a framework for detecting and eliminating malicious logic embedded in a kernel driver through iteratively eliminating unnecessary kernel API invocations from the driver. When provided with the binary of a trojaned driver, DRIP generates a purified driver with benign functionalities preserved and malicious ones eliminated. Our evaluation shows that DRIP successfully eliminates malicious effects of trojaned drivers in the system, with the purified drivers maintaining or even improving their performance over the trojaned drivers.",

        "abstract": "With the continuing evolution of sophisticated APT attacks, provenance tracking is becoming an important technique for efficient attack investigation in enterprise networks. Most of existing provenance techniques are operating on system event auditing that discloses dependence relationships by scrutinizing syscall traces. Unfortunately, such auditing-based provenance is not able to track the causality of another important dimension in provenance, the shared libraries. Different from other data-only system entities like files and sockets, dynamic libraries are linked at runtime and may get executed, which poses new challenges in provenance tracking. For example, library provenance cannot be tracked by syscalls and mapping; whether a library function is called and how it is called within an execution context is invisible at syscall level; linking a library does not promise their execution at runtime. Addressing these challenges is critical to tracking sophisticated attacks leveraging libraries. In this paper, to facilitate fine-grained investigation inside the execution of library binaries, we develop Lprov, a novel provenance tracking system which combines library tracing and syscall tracing. Upon a syscall, Lprov identifies the library calls together with the stack which induces it so that the library execution provenance can be accurately revealed. Our evaluation shows that Lprov can precisely identify attack provenance involving libraries, including malicious library attack and library vulnerability exploitation, while syscall-based provenance tools fail to identify. It only incurs 7.0% (in geometric mean) runtime overhead and consumes 3 times less storage space of a state-of-the-art provenance tool.",

        "abstract": "Modern browsers have a highly concurrent page rendering process in order to be more responsive. However, such a concurrent execution model leads to various race issues. In this paper, we present ARROW, a static technique that can automatically, safely, and cost effectively patch certain race issues on client side pages. It works by statically modeling a web page as a causal graph denoting happens-before relations between page elements, according to the rendering process in browsers. Races are detected by identifying inconsistencies between the graph and the dependence relations intended by the developer. Detected races are fixed by leveraging a constraint solver to add a set of edges with the minimum cost to the causal graph so that it is consistent with the intended dependences. The input page is then transformed to respect the repair edges. ARROW has fixed 151 races from 20 real world commercial web sites.",

Such errors, often referred to as Heisenbugs, are difficult to detect, prevent, and repair. In this paper, we present a new technique to increase program robustness against Heisenbugs. We profile correct executions from provided test suites to infer fine-grained atomicity properties. Additional deadlock-free locking is injected into the program to guarantee these properties hold on production runs. Notably, our technique does not rely on witnessing or analyzing erroneous executions. The end result is a scheme that only permits executions which are guaranteed to preserve the atomicity properties derived from the profile. Evaluation results on large, real-world, open-source programs show that our technique can effectively suppress subtle concurrency bugs, with small runtime overheads (typically less than 15%).",

To perform a malicious action, such a trojan identifies and reuses an existing function in a legal binary program instead of implementing the function itself. Furthermore, this trojan is stealthy in that the malicious invocation of a targeted function usually takes place in a location where it is legal to do so, closely mimicking a legal invocation. At the network level, the victim binary can still follow its communication protocol without exhibiting any anomalous behavior. Meanwhile, many close-source shareware binaries are rich in functions that can be maliciously \u201creused\u201d, making them attractive targets of this type of attack. In this paper, we present a framework to determine if a given binary program is vulnerable to this attack and to construct a concrete trojan if so. Our experiments with a number of real-world software binaries demonstrate that the reuse-oriented camouflaging trojans are a real threat and vulnerabilities of this type in legal binaries can be effectively revealed and confirmed.",

Existing solutions have largely focused on whole-system profiling - generating a globally minimum kernel image that is being shared by all applications. However, since different applications use only part of the kernel's code base, the minimized kernel still includes an unnecessarily large attack surface. Furthermore, once the static minimized kernel is generated, it is not flexible enough to adapt to an altered execution environment (e.g., new workload). FACE-CHANGE is a virtualization-based system to facilitate dynamic switching at runtime among multiple minimized kernels, each customized for an individual application. Based on precedent profiling results, FACE-CHANGE transparently presents a customized kernel view for each application to confine its reach ability of kernel code. In the event that the application exceeds this boundary, FACE-CHANGE is able to recover the missing code and back trace its attack/exception provenance to analyze the anomalous behavior.",

        "abstract": "To scale to today's complex distributed software systems, debugging and replaying techniques mostly focus on single facets of software, e.g., local concurrency, distributed messaging, or data representation. This forces developers to tediously combine different technologies such as instruction-level dynamic tracing, event log analysis, or global state reconstruction to gradually explain non-trivial defects. This paper proposes Recon, a debugging system that provides iterative and interactive homogeneous debugging services. As related systems, Recon promotes SQL-like queries for debugging distributed systems. Unlike other approaches, however, Recon allows for all system artifacts including nodes, communication channels, events, or instructions to be uniformly described by relations. Also, an application in Recon originally runs with a lightweight logger that only collects replay logs for individual nodes. Developers debug a complete program by replaying the execution with fine-grained instrumentation that is capable of exposing instruction-level information. We illustrate the effectiveness of Recon on programs as diverse as BerkeleyDB, i3/Chord, RandTree, and Pastry. Our evaluation includes executions in local clusters as well as in Amazon EC2 and exhibits an unreported bug in RandTree.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic slicing algorithms have been considered to aid in debugging for many years. However, as far as we know, no detailed studies on evaluating the benefits of using dynamic slicing for locating real faults present in programs have been carried out. In this paper we study the effectiveness of fault location using dynamic slicing for a set of real bugs reported in some widely used software programs. Our results show that of the 19 faults studied, 12 faults were captured by data slices, 7 required the use of full slices, and none of them required the use of relevant slices. Moreover, it was observed that dynamic slicing considerably reduced the subset of program statements that needed to be examined to locate faulty statements. Interestingly, we observed that all of the memory bugs in the faulty versions were captured by data slices. The dynamic slices that captured faulty code included 0.45 to 63.18% of statements that were executed at least once.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic slicing algorithms can greatly reduce the debuggingeffort by focusing the attention of the user on a relevantsubset of program statements. Recently algorithms forforward computation of dynamic slices have beenproposed which maintain dynamic slices of all variables asthe program executes. An advantage of this approach is thatwhen a request for a slice is made, it is already available.The main disadvantage of using such an algorithm for slicingrealistic programs is that the space and time requiredto maintain a large set of dynamic slices corresponding toall program variables can be very high. In this paper weanalyze the characteristics of dynamic slices and identifyproperties that enable space efficient representation of a setof dynamic slices. We show that by using reduced orderedbinary decision diagrams (roBDDs) to represent a set ofdynamic slices, the space and time requirements of maintainingdynamic slices are greatly reduced. In fact not onlycan the latest dynamic slices of all variables be easilymaintained, but rather all dynamic slices of all variablesthroughout a program\u00fds execution can be maintained. Ourexperiments show that our roBDD based algorithm for forwardcomputation of dynamic slices can maintain 107-217million dynamic slices arising during long program runs usingonly 28-392 megabytes of storage. In addition, the performanceof the roBDD based forward computation methodcompares favorably with the performance of the LP backwardcomputation algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Smartphone apps have changed the way we interact with online services, but highly specialized apps come at a cost to privacy. In this paper we will demonstrate that a passive eavesdropper is capable of identifying finegrained user activities within the wireless network traffic generated by apps. Despite the widespread use of fully encrypted communication, our technique, called NetScope, is based on the intuition that the highly specific implementation of each app leaves a fingerprint on its traffic behavior (e.g., transfer rates, packet exchanges, and data movement). By learning the subtle traffic behavioral differences between activities (e.g., \\\"browsing\\\" versus \\\"chatting\\\" in a dating app), NetScope is able to perform robust inference of users' activities, for both Android and iOS devices, based solely on inspecting IP headers. Our evaluation with 35 widely popular app activities (ranging from social networking and dating to personal health and presidential campaigns) shows that NetScope yields high detection accuracy (78.04% precision and 76.04% recall on average).",

Desirable execution indices reveal correlations between points in an execution and establish correspondence between points across multiple executions. Therefore, execution indexing is essential for a wide variety of dynamic program analyses, for example, it can be used to organize program profiles; it can precisely identify the point in a re-execution that corresponds to a given point in an original execution and thus facilitate debugging or dynamic instrumentation. In this paper, we formally define the concept of execution index and propose an indexing scheme based on execution structure and program state. We present a highly optimized online implementation of the technique. We also perform a client study, which targets producing a failure inducing schedule for a data race by verifying the two alternative happens-before orderings of a racing pair. Indexing is used to precisely locate corresponding points across multiple executions in the presence of non-determinism so that no heavyweight tracing/replay system is needed.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence models are becoming an integral part of modern computing systems. Just like software inevitably has bugs, models have bugs too, leading to poor classification/prediction accuracy. Unlike software bugs, model bugs cannot be easily fixed by directly modifying models. Existing solutions work by providing additional training inputs. However, they have limited effectiveness due to the lack of understanding of model misbehaviors and hence the incapability of selecting proper inputs. Inspired by software debugging, we propose a novel model debugging technique that works by first conducting model state differential analysis to identify the internal features of the model that are responsible for model bugs and then performing training input selection that is similar to program input selection in regression testing. Our evaluation results on 29 different models for 6 different applications show that our technique can fix model bugs effectively and efficiently without introducing new bugs. For simple applications (e.g., digit recognition), MODE improves the test accuracy from 75% to 93% on average whereas the state-of-the-art can only improve to 85% with 11 times more training time. For complex applications and models (e.g., object recognition), MODE is able to improve the accuracy from 75% to over 91% in minutes to a few hours, whereas state-of-the-art fails to fix the bug or even degrades the test accuracy.\n\n",

        "abstract": "With modern multi-core architectures, web applications are usually configured to serve multiple requests simultaneously by spawning multiple instances. These instances may access the same external resources such as database tables and files. Such contentions may become severe during peak time, leading to violations of atomic business logic. In this paper, we propose a novel static analysis that detects atomicity violations of external operations for server side scripts. The analysis differs from traditional atomicity violation detection techniques by focusing on external resources instead of shared memory. It consists of three components. The first one is an interprocedural and path-sensitive resource identity analysis that determines whether multiple operations access the same external resource, which is critical to identifying contentions. The second component infers pairs of external operations that should be executed atomically. Finally, violations are detected by reasoning about serializability of interleaved atomic pairs. Experimental results show that the analysis is highly effective in detecting atomicity violations in real-world web apps.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an automated debugging technique that explains a failure by computing its causal path leading from the root cause to the failure. Given a failing execution, the technique first searches for a dynamic patch. Fine-grained execution comparison be- tween the failing run and the patched run is performed to isolate the causal path. We introduce a formal sys- tem, wherein the corrected version of a faulty program is assumed so that the concept of ideal failure inducing chain (FIC) can be defined by comparing the failing run and the run on the corrected program using the same input. Properties of such chains are studied. A product of the formal system is a metric that serves in the ob- jective evaluation of the proposed technique. We iden- tify a key enabling technique called execution indexing, whose goal is to establish a mapping between equivalent points in two different executions so that comparison can be meaningfully performed. We show that a control structure based indexing scheme, when integrated into the formal system, demonstrates very nice properties that can be exploited to develop an effective and effi- cient debugging algorithm. The evaluation shows that the metric lives up to its promise, computing desired FICs, and the proposed approach is able to compute high quality FICs. The results of our technique signif- icantly supercede the state of the art.",

        "abstract": "Traditional sensitive data disclosure analysis faces two challenges: to identify sensitive data that is not generated by specific API calls, and to report the potential disclosures when the disclosed data is recognized as sensitive only after the sink operations. We address these issues by developing BidText, a novel static technique to detect sensitive data disclosures. BidText formulates the problem as a type system, in which variables are typed with the text labels that they encounter (e.g., during key-value pair operations). The type system features a novel bi-directional propagation technique that propagates the variable label sets through forward and backward data-flow. A data disclosure is reported if a parameter at a sink point is typed with a sensitive text label. BidText is evaluated on 10,000 Android apps. It reports 4,406 apps that have sensitive data disclosures, with 4,263 apps having log based disclosures and 1,688 having disclosures due to other sinks such as HTTP requests. Existing techniques can only report 64.0% of what BidText reports. And manual inspection shows that the false positive rate for BidText is 10%.",

        "abstract": "Although dynamic program slicing was first introduced to aid in user level debugging, applications aimed at improving software quality, reliability, security, and performance have since been identified as candidates for using dynamic slicing. However, the dynamic dependence graph constructed to compute dynamic slices can easily cause slicing algorithms to run out of memory for realistic program runs. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a cost effective dynamic program slicing algorithm. This algorithm is based upon a dynamic dependence graph representation that is highly compact and rapidly traversable. Thus, the graph can be held in memory and dynamic slices can be quickly computed. A compact representation is derived by recognizing that all dynamic dependences (data and control) need not be individually represented. We identify sets of dynamic dependence edges between a pair of statements that can share a single representative edge. We further show that the dependence graph can be transformed in a manner that increases sharing and sharing can be performed even in the presence of aliasing. Experiments show that transformed dynamic dependence graphs explicitly represent only 6% of the dependence edges present in the full dynamic dependence graph. When the full graph sizes range from 0.84 to 1.95 Gigabytes in size, our compacted graphs range from 20 to 210 Megabytes in size. Average slicing times for our algorithm range from 1.74 to 36.25 seconds across several benchmarks from SPECInt2000/95.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art memory forensics involves signature-based scanning of memory images to uncover data structure instances of interest to investigators. A largely unaddressed challenge is that investigators may not be able to interpret the content of data structure fields, even with a deep understanding of the data structure's syntax and semantics. This is very common for data structures with application-specific encoding, such as those representing images, figures, passwords, and formatted file contents. For example, an investigator may know that a buffer field is holding a photo image, but still cannot display (and hence understand) the image. We call this the data structure content reverse engineering challenge. In this paper, we present DSCRETE, a system that enables automatic interpretation and rendering of in-memory data structure contents. DSCRETE is based on the observation that the application in which a data structure is defined usually contains interpretation and rendering logic to generate human-understandable output for that data structure. Hence DSCRETE aims to identify and reuse such logic in the program's binary and create a \\\"scanner+renderer\\\" tool for scanning and rendering instances of the data structure in a memory image. Different from signature-based approaches, DSCRETE avoids reverse engineering data structure signatures. Our evaluation with a wide range of real-world application binaries shows that DSCRETE is able to recover a variety of application data -- e.g., images, figures, screenshots, user accounts, and formatted files and messages -- with high accuracy. The raw contents of such data would otherwise be unfathomable to human investigators.",

        "abstract": "Modern Android malwares tend to use advanced techniques to cover their malicious behaviors. They usually feature multi-staged, condition-guarded and environment-specific payloads. An increasing number of them utilize WebView, particularly the two-way communications between Java and JavaScript, to evade detection and analysis of existing techniques. We propose Dual-Force, a forced execution technique which simultaneously forces both Java and JavaScript code of WebView applications to execute along various paths without requiring any environment setup or providing any inputs manually. As such, the hidden payloads of WebView malwares are forcefully exposed. The technique features a novel execution model that allows forced execution to suppress exceptions and continue execution. Experimental results show that Dual-Force precisely exposes malicious payload in 119 out of 150 WebView malwares. Compared to the state-of-the-art, Dual-Force can expose 23% more malicious behaviors.\n\n",

Our experiments show that the LP algorithm is a fast and practical precise data slicing algorithm.

        "abstract": "Migrating sequential programs to effectively utilize next generation multicore architectures is a key challenge facing application developers and implementors. Languages like Java that support complex control- and dataflow abstractions confound classical automatic parallelization techniques. On the other hand, introducing multithreading and concurrency control explicitly into programs can impose a high conceptual burden on the programmer, and may entail a significant rewrite of the original program. In this paper, we consider a new technique to address this issue. Our approach makes use of futures, a simple annotation that introduces asynchronous concurrency into Java programs, but provides no concurrency control. To ensure concurrent execution does not yield behavior inconsistent with sequential execution (i.e., execution yielded by erasing all futures), we present a new interprocedural summary-based dataflow analysis. The analysis inserts lightweight barriers that block and resume threads executing futures if a dependency violation may ensue. There are no constraints on how threads execute other than those imposed by these barriers. Our experimental results indicate futures can be leveraged to transparently ensure safety and profitably exploit parallelism; in contrast to earlier efforts, our technique is completely portable, and requires no modifications to the underlying JVM.",

In order to leverage their testing efforts, failure reporting components have been widely deployed in released software. Many utilities of the collected failure data depend on an effective failure indexing technique, which, at the optimal case, would index all failures due to the same bug together. Unfortunately, the problem of failure proximity, which underpins the effectiveness of an indexing technique, has not been systematically studied. This article presents the first systematic study of failure proximity. A failure proximity consists of two components: a fingerprinting function that extracts signatures from failures, and a distance function that calculates the likelihood of two failures being due to the same bug. By considering different instantiations of the two functions, we study an array of six failure proximities (two of them are new) in this article. These proximities range from the simplest approach that checks failure points to the most sophisticated approach that utilizes fault localization algorithms to extract failure signatures. Besides presenting technical details of each proximity, we also study the properties of each proximity and tradeoffs between proximities. These altogether deliver a systematic view of failure proximity.",

        "title": "Enabling tracing Of long-running multithreaded programs via dynamic execution reduction",
        "abstract": "Debugging long running multithreaded programs is a very challenging problem when using tracing-based analyses. Since such programs are non-deterministic, reproducing the bug is non-trivial and generating and inspecting traces for long running programs can be prohibitively expensive. We propose a framework in which, to overcome the problem of bug reproducibility, a lightweight logging technique is used to log the events during the original execution. When a bug is encountered, it is reproduced using the generated log and during the replay, a fine-grained tracing technique is employed to collect control-flow/dependence traces that are then used to locate the root cause of the bug. In this paper, we address the key challenges resulting due to tracing, that is, the prohibitively high expense of collecting traces and the significant burden on the user who must examine the large amount of trace information to locate the bug in a long-running multithreaded program. These challenges are addressed through execution reduction that realizes a combination of logging and tracing such that traces collected contain only the execution information from those regions of threads that are relevant to the fault. This approach is highly effective because we observe that for long running multithreaded programs, many threads that execute are irrelevant to the fault. Hence, these threads need not be replayed and traced when trying to reproduce the bug. We develop a novel lightweight scheme that identifies such threads by observing all the interthread data dependences and removes their execution footprint in the replay run. In addition, we identify regions of thread executions that need not be replayed or, if they must be replayed, we determine if they need not be traced. Following execution reduction, the replayed execution takes lesser time to run and it produces a much smaller trace than the original execution. Thus, the cost of collecting traces and the effort of examining the traces to locate the fault are greatly reduced.",

Different inputs often have different optimal settings. Program tuning is hence of great importance. Existing tuning techniques treat the the program as a black-box and hence cannot leverage the internal program states to achieve better tuning. We propose a white-box tuning technique that is implemented as a library. The user can compose complex program tuning tasks by adding a small number of library calls to the original program and providing a few callback functions. Our experiments on 13 widely-used real-world programs show that our technique substantially improves data processing results and outperforms OpenTuner, the state-of-the-art black-box tuning technique.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Dynamic taint analysis (DTA), as a mainstream information flow tracking technique, has been widely used in mobile security. On the Android platform, the existing DTA approaches are typically implemented by instrumenting the Dalvik virtual machine (DVM) interpreter or the Android emulator with taint enforcement code. The most prominent problem of the interpreter-based approaches is that they cannot work in the new Android RunTime (ART) environment introduced since the 5.0 release. For the emulator-based approaches, the most prominent problem is that they cannot be deployed on real devices. In addition, almost all the existing Android DTA approaches only concern the explicit information flow caused by data dependence, while completely ignore the impact of implicit information flow caused by control dependence. These problems limit their adoption in the latest Android system and make them ineffective in detecting the state-of-the-art malware whose privacy-breaching behaviors are inactivated in the analyzed environment (e.g., the emulator) or conducted via implicit information flow. In this paper, we present TaintMan, an ART-compatible DTA framework that can be deployed on unmodified and non-rooted Android devices. In TaintMan, the taint enforcement code is statically instrumented into both the target application and the system class libraries to track data flow and common control flow. A specially designed execution environment reconstruction technique, named reference hijacking, is proposed to force the target application to reference the instrumented system class libraries. By enforcing on-demand instrumentation and on-demand tracking, the performance overhead is significantly reduced. We have developed TaintMan and deployed it on two popular stock smartphones (HTC One S equipped with Android-4.0 and Motorola MOTO G equipped with Android-5.0). The evaluation with malware samples and real-world applications shows that TaintMan can effectively detect privacy leakage behaviors with an acceptable performance overhead.",

        "title": "Towards locating execution omission errors",
        "abstract": "Execution omission errors are known to be difficult to locate using dynamic analysis. These errors lead to a failure at runtime because of the omission of execution of some statements that would have been executed if the program had no errors. Since dynamic analysis is typically designed to focus on dynamic information arising from executed statements, and statements whose execution is omitted do not produce dynamic information, detection of execution omission errors becomes a challenging task. For example, while dynamic slices are very effective in capturing faulty code for other types of errors, they fail to capture faulty code in presence of execution omission errors. To address this issue relevant slices have been defined to consider certain static dependences (called potential dependences) in addition to dynamic dependences. However, due to the conservative nature of static analysis, overly large slices are produced. In this paper, we propose a fully dynamic solution to locating execution omission errors using dynamic slices. We introduce the notion of implicit dependences which are dependences that are normally invisible to dynamic slicing due to the omission of execution of some statements. We design a dynamic method that forces the execution of the omitted code by switching outcomes of relevant predicates such that those implicit dependences are exposed and become available for dynamic slicing. Dynamic slices can be computed and effectively pruned to produce fault candidate sets containing the execution omission errors. We solve two main problems: verifying the existence of a single implicit dependence through predicate switching, and recovering the implicit dependences in a demand driven manner such that a small number of verifications are required before the root cause is captured. Our experiments show that the proposed technique is highly effective in capturing execution omission errors.",

We present parallel execution profiles (PEPs), which capture the relative behavior of parallel threads in terms of the user selected code regions they execute. The user annotates the program to identify code regions of interest. The PEP divides the execution time of a multithreaded application into time intervals or a sequence of frames during which the code regions being executed in parallel by application threads remain the same. PEPs can be easily analyzed to compute execution times spent by the application in interesting behavior states. This helps user understand the severity of common performance problems such as excessive waiting on events by threads, threads contending for locks, and the presence of straggler threads.",

This representation is motivated by the observation that typically a significant fraction of data dependence history can be recovered from the control flow trace. To capture the remainder of the data dependence history we introduce disambiguation checks in the program whose control flow signatures capture the results of the checks. The resulting extended control flow trace enables the recovery of otherwise unrecoverable data dependences. The code for the checks is designed to minimize the increase in the program execution time and the extended control flow trace size when compared to directly collecting control flow and dependence traces. Our experiments show that compressed eWPPs are only 4% of the size of combined compressed control flow and dependence traces and their collection requires 20% more runtime overhead than overhead required for directly collecting the control flow and dependence traces.",

Prior techniques to locate faulty code either use program analysis techniques such as backward dynamic program slicing or exclusively use delta debugging to analyze the state changes during program execution. In this paper, we present a new approach that integrates the potential of delta debugging algorithm with the benefit of forward and backward dynamic program slicing to narrow down the search for faulty code. Our approach is to use delta debugging algorithm to identify a minimal failure-inducing input, use this input to compute a forward dynamic slice and then intersect the statements in this forward dynamic slice with the statements in the backward dynamic slice of the erroneous output to compute a failure-inducing chop. We implemented our technique and conducted experiments with faulty versions of several programs from the Siemens suite to evaluate our technique. Our experiments show that failure-inducing chops can greatly reduce the size of search space compared to the dynamic slices without significantly compromising the capability to locate the faulty code. We also applied our technique to several programs with known memory related bugs such as buffer overflow bugs. The failure-inducing chop in several of these cases contained only 2 to 4 statements which included the code causing memory corruption.",

In this paper, we propose to extend program synthesis techniques to construct models for system and library functions. The technique samples the behavior of the original implementation of a function. The samples are used as the specification to synthesize the model, which is a C program. The generated model is iteratively refined. We have developed a prototype that can successfully construct models for a pool of system and library calls from their real world complex binary implementations.

We have used the above framework to implement three variants of dynamic slicing algorithms including: data slicing, full slicing, and relevant slicing algorithms. We have carried out detailed experiments to evaluate these algorithms.

        "abstract": "GitHub, a popular social-software-development platform, has fostered a variety of software ecosystems where projects depend on one another and practitioners interact with each other. Projects within an ecosystem often have complex inter-dependencies that impose new challenges in bug reporting and fixing. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on cross-project correlated bugs, i.e., causally related bugs reported to different projects, focusing on two aspects: 1) how developers track the root causes across projects; and 2) how the downstream developers coordinate to deal with upstream bugs. Through manual inspection of bug reports collected from the scientific Python ecosystem and an online survey with developers, this study reveals the common practices of developers and the various factors in fixing cross-project bugs. These findings provide implications for future software bug analysis in the scope of ecosystem, as well as shed light on the requirements of issue trackers for such bugs.",

In this paper, we present a Python predictive analysis. It first collects the trace of an execution, and then encodes the trace and unexecuted branches to symbolic constraints.

Solving the constraints identifies bugs and their triggering inputs. Our evaluation shows that the technique is highly effective in analyzing real-world complex programs with a lot of dynamic features and external library calls, due to its sophisticated encoding design based on traces.

To mitigate sophisticated code reuse attacks, we proposed a light-weight virtual machine, ReRanz, which deployed a novel continuous binary code re-randomization to mitigate memory disclosure oriented attacks. In order to meet security and performance goals, costly code randomization operations were outsourced to a separate process, called the \\\"shuffling process\\\". The shuffling process continuously flushed the old code and replaced it with a fine-grained randomized code variant. ReRanz repeated the process each time an adversary might obtain the information and upload a payload. Our performance evaluation shows that ReRanz Virtual Machine incurs a very low performance overhead. The security evaluation shows that ReRanz successfully protect the Nginx web server against the Blind-ROP attack.",

        "abstract": "With the booming sale of iOS devices, the number of iOS applications has increased significantly in recent years. To protect the security of iOS users, Apple requires every iOS application to go through a vetting process called App Review to detect uses of private APIs that provide access to sensitive user information. However, recent attacks have shown the feasibility of using private APIs without being detected during App Review. To counter such attacks, we propose a new iOS application vetting system, called iRiS, in this paper. iRiS first applies fast static analysis to resolve API calls. For those that cannot be statically resolved, iRiS uses a novel iterative dynamic analysis approach, which is slower but more powerful compared to static analysis. We have ported Valgrind to iOS and implemented a prototype of iRiS on top of it. We evaluated iRiS with 2019 applications from the official App Store. From these, iRiS identified 146 (7%) applications that use a total number of 150 different private APIs, including 25 security-critical APIs that access sensitive user information, such as device serial number. By analyzing iOS applications using iRiS, we also identified a suspicious advertisement service provider which collects user privacy information in its advertisement serving library. Our results show that, contrary to popular belief, a nontrivial number of iOS applications that violate Apple's terms of service exist in the App Store. iRiS is effective in detecting private API abuse missed by App Review.",

Existing string solvers either ignore non-string program behavior or support limited set of string operations. In this paper, we develop a general purpose string solver, called Z3-str, as an extension of the Z3 SMT solver through its plug-in interface. Z3-str treats strings as a primitive type, thus avoiding the inherent limitations observed in many existing solvers that encode strings in terms of other primitives. The logic of the plug-in has three sorts, namely, bool, int and string. The string-sorted terms include string constants and variables of arbitrary length, with functions such as concatenation, sub-string, and replace. The int-sorted terms are standard, with the exception of the length function over string terms. The atomic formulas are equations over string terms, and (in)-equalities over integer terms. Not only does our solver have features that enable whole program symbolic, static and dynamic analysis, but also it performs better than other solvers in our experiments. The application of Z3-str in remote code execution detection shows that its support of a wide spectrum of string operations is key to reducing false positives.",

        "abstract": "Fuzzing is an important technique to detect software bugs and vulnerabilities. It works by mutating a small set of seed inputs to generate a large number of new inputs. Fuzzers' performance often substantially degrades when valid seed inputs are not available. Although existing techniques such as symbolic execution can generate seed inputs from scratch, they have various limitations hindering their applications in real-world complex software. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzing technique that features the capability of generating valid seed inputs. It piggy-backs on AFL to identify input validity checks and the input fields that have impact on such checks. It further classifies these checks according to their relations to the input. Such classes include arithmetic relation, object offset, data structure length and so on. A multi-goal search algorithm is developed to apply class-specific mutations in order to satisfy inter-dependent checks all together. We evaluate our technique on 20 popular benchmark programs collected from other fuzzing projects and the Google fuzzer test suite, and compare it with existing fuzzers AFL and AFLFast, symbolic execution engines KLEE and S2E, and a hybrid tool Driller that combines fuzzing with symbolic execution. The results show that our technique is highly effective and efficient, out-performing the other tools.\n\n",

In this paper we present a novel approach for preventing the creation of unauthorized copies of software. Our approach splits software modules into open and hidden components. The open components are installed (executed) on an unsecure machine while the hidden components are installed (executed) on a secure machine. We assume that while open components can be stolen, to obtain a fully functioning copy of the software, the hidden components must be recovered. We describe an algorithm that constructs hidden components by slicing the original software components. We argue that recovery of hidden components constructed through slicing, in order to obtain a fully functioning copy of the software, is a complex task. We further develop security analysis to capture the complexity of recovering hidden components. Finally we apply our technique to several large Java programs to study the complexity of recovering constructed hidden components and to measure the runtime overhead introduced by splitting of software into open and hidden components.",

Many of them are difficult to apply in practice because their system and library requirements are incompatible with those of the subject software. We propose a technique called platform independent executable trace. Our technique traces and virtualizes a regular program execution that is platform dependent, and generates a stand-alone program called the trace program. Running the trace program re-generates the original execution. More importantly, trace program execution is completely independent of the underlying operating system and libraries such that it can be compiled and executed on arbitrary platforms. As such, it can be analyzed by a third party tool on a platform preferred by the tool. We have implemented the technique on x86 and sensor platforms. We show that buggy executions of 10 realworld Windows and sensor applications can be traced and virtualized, and later analyzed by existing Linux tools. We also demonstrate how the technique can be used in cross-platform malware analysis.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Integer-Overflow-to-Buffer-Overflow (IO2BO) vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to cause severe damages to computer systems. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of IntTracker, an efficient dynamic tracking technique for detecting IO2BO vulnerabilities in C/C++ programs. IntTracker utilizes a static taint analysis to select potential overflow sites that are integer operations along critical paths, from sources that are program points reading values from users, to sinks that are memory allocation sites. It then instruments overflow checks at the selected sites. Instead of producing warnings once integer overflows occur, IntTracker replaces the overflown value with a very large and rarely used integer value (dirty value), and treats such the value as an overflow tag. Tag propagation is performed by the existing program operations without any instrumentation as operations on dirty values often produce dirty values. Propagation can be automatically cut off by sanitization routines as they could prevent dirty values from affecting further program execution. IntTracker monitors whether any dirty value is used at a sink to detect IO2BO vulnerabilities. We evaluate IntTracker on 3444 programs of the NIST's SAMATE reference dataset, the SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks and 34 IO2BO bugs in real world. The experimental results show that IntTracker is effective in detecting harmful IO2BO vulnerabilities while bypassing false positives introduced by sanitization routines. Meanwhile, the runtime overhead is negligible, averaging about 0.69%. In contrast, IntPatch, the state of the art, produces a lot more false positives and has a higher overhead.",

        "abstract": "Despite significant recent advances, the effectiveness of symbolic execution is limited when used to test complex, real-world software. One of the main scalability challenges is related to constraint solving: large applications and long exploration paths lead to complex constraints, often involving big arrays indexed by symbolic expressions. In this paper, we propose a set of semantics-preserving transformations for array operations that take advantage of contextual information collected during symbolic execution. Our transformations lead to simpler encodings and hence better performance in constraint solving. The results we obtain are encouraging: we show, through an extensive experimental analysis, that our transformations help to significantly improve the performance of symbolic execution in the presence of arrays. We also show that our transformations enable the analysis of new code, which would be otherwise out of reach for symbolic execution.",

This paper discusses the reason of instability in software development process, and presents a toolchain that not only detects the potential instability in software, but also diagnoses the reason for such instability. We classify the reason of instability into two categories. When it is introduced by software requirements, we call the instability  caused by problem  . In this case, it cannot be avoided by improving software development, but requires inspecting the requirements, especially the underlying mathematical properties. Otherwise, we call the instability  caused by practice . We design our toolchain as four loosely-coupled tools, which combine stochastic arithmetic with infinite-precision testing. Each tool in our toolchain can be configured with different strategies according to the properties of the analyzed software. We evaluate our toolchain on subjects from literature. The results show that it effectively detects and separates the instabilities caused by problems from others. We also conduct an evaluation on the latest version of GNU Scientific Library, and the toolchain finds a few real bugs in the well-maintained and widely deployed numerical library.

        "abstract": "The sensory system of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) plays an important role in flight safety. Thus, any sensor fault/failure can have potentially catastrophic effects on vehicle control. The recent advance in adversarial studies demonstrated successful sensing fault generation by targeting the physical vulnerabilities of the sensors. It poses new security challenges for sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) and fault recovery (FR) research because the conventional redundancy-based fault-tolerant design is not effective against such faults. To address these challenges, we present a redundancy-free method for UAV sensor FDI and FR. In the FDI design, we used a basic state estimator for a rough early warning of faults. We then refine the design by considering the unmeasurable actuator state and modeling uncertainties. Under such novel strategies, the proposed method achieves fine-grained fault isolation. Based on this method, we further designed a redundancy-free FR method by using complementary sensor estimations. In particular, position and attitude feedback can provide backup feedback for each other through geometric correlation. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through simulation of several challenging sensor failure scenarios. The recovery performance is experimentally demonstrated by a challenging flight tasks-restoring control after completely losing attitude sensory feedback. With the protection of FDI and FR, flight safety is ensured. This UAV security enhancement method is promising to be generalized for other types of vehicles and can serve as a compensation to other fault-tolerant methodologies.",

        "abstract": "Integer overflow (IO) vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to compromise computer systems. In the mean time, IOs can be used intentionally by programmers for benign purposes such as hashing and random number generation. Hence, differentiating exploitable and harmful IOs from intentional and benign ones is an important challenge. It allows reducing the number of false positives produced by IO vulnerability detection techniques, helping developers or security analysts to focus on fixing critical IOs without inspecting the numerous false alarms. The difficulty of recognizing benign IOs mainly lies in inferring the intent of programmers from source code. In this paper, we present a novel technique to recognize benign IOs via equivalence checking across multiple precisions. We determine if an IO is benign by comparing the effects of an overflowed integer arithmetic operation in the actual world (with limited precision) and the same operation in the ideal world (with sufficient precision to evade the IO). Specifically, we first extract the data flow path from the overflowed integer arithmetic operation to a security-related program point (i.e., sink) and then create a new version of the path using more precise types with sufficient bits to represent integers so that the IO can be avoided. Using theorem proving we check whether these two versions are equivalent, that is, if they yield the same values at the sink under all possible inputs. If so, the IO is benign. We implement a prototype, named IntEQ, based on the GCC compiler and the Z3 solver, and evaluate it using 26 harmful IO vulnerabilities from 20 real-world programs, and 444 benign IOs from SPECINT 2000, SPECINT 2006, and 7 real-world applications. The experimental results show that IntEQ does not misclassify any harmful IO bugs (no false negatives) and recognizes 355 out of 444 (about 79.95%) benign IOs, whereas the state of the art can only recognize 19 benign IOs.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has been created a number of new platforms recently. Unfortunately, such variety of IoT devices causes platform fragmentation which makes software development on such devices challenging. In particular, existing programs cannot be simply reused on such devices as they rely on certain underlying hardware and software interfaces which we call platform dependencies. In this paper, we present CPR, a novel technique that synthesizes a platform independent program from a platform dependent program. Specifically, we leverage an existing system called PIEtrace which can generate a platform independent trace program. The generated trace program is platform independent while it can only reproduce a specific execution path. Hence, we develop an algorithm to merge a set of platform independent trace programs and synthesize a general program that can take multiple inputs. The synthesized platform-independent program is representative of the merged trace programs and the results produced by the program is correct if no exceptions occur. Our evaluation results on 15 real-world applications show that CPR is highly effective on reusing existing binaries across platforms.",

        "abstract": " In the current online advertisement delivery, an ad slot on a publisher's website may go through multiple layers of bidding and reselling until the final ad content is delivered. The publishers have little control on the ads being displayed on their web pages. As a result, website visitors may suffer from unwanted ads such as malvertising, intrusive ads, and information disclosure ads. Unfortunately, the visitors often blame the publisher for their unpleasant experience and switch to competitor websites. In this paper, we propose a novel programming support system for ad delivery, called PAD, for publisher programmers, who specify their policies on regulating third-party ads shown on their websites. PAD features an expressive specification language and a novel persistent policy enforcement runtime that can self-install and self-protect throughout the entire ad delegation chain. It also provides an ad-specific memory protection scheme that prevents malvertising by corrupting malicious payloads. Our experiments show that PAD has negligible runtime overhead. It effectively suppresses a set of malvertising cases and unwanted ad behaviors reported in the real world, without affecting normal functionalities and regular ads. \n\n",

        "abstract": "Virtual Machine (VM) migration is an appealing technique on nowadays cloud platforms to achieve high availability, load balancing and power saving. Unfortunately, migration of VM involves transferring a large amount of data, thereby imposing high overheads on network traffic, and consequently results in significant application performance degradation. In this paper, we propose an introspection-based memory pruning method for fast and effective live VM migration. Firstly, we classify memory pages into five categories including anonymous, inode, kernel, free and cache pages, according to how they are used by OS. Then, upon migration, we drop the free pages which are insignificant and cache pages which are redundant. In this way, a large amount of unnecessary data are precluded, so that the migration time is reduced as well. Our system can classify memory pages into specific categories precisely using introspection. Besides cache pages, we also eliminate the pages that are ever used but are freed later which is different from most of the works that only eliminate free pages which are marked as zero pages by OS. Experiments show that our work achieves preferable reduction (72% on average ) in terms of the total migration time compared with the original pre-copy algorithm within QEMU/KVM.",

        "abstract": "Existing mutation based fuzzers tend to randomly mutate the input of a program without understanding its underlying syntax and semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel on-the-fly probing technique (called ProFuzzer) that automatically recovers and understands input fields of critical importance to vulnerability discovery during a fuzzing process and intelligently adapts the mutation strategy to enhance the chance of hitting zero-day targets. Since such probing is transparently piggybacked to the regular fuzzing, no prior knowledge of the input specification is needed. During fuzzing, individual bytes are first mutated and their fuzzing results are automatically analyzed to link those related together and identify the type for the field connecting them; these bytes are further mutated together following type-specific strategies, which substantially prunes the search space. We define the probe types generally across all applications, thereby making our technique application agnostic. Our experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world applications show that ProFuzzer substantially outperforms AFL and its optimized version AFLFast, as well as other state-of-art fuzzers including VUzzer, Driller and QSYM. Within two months, it exposed 42 zero-days in 10 intensively tested programs, generating 30 CVEs.",

        "abstract": "Recent paradigm shifts in distributed computing such as the advent of cloud computing pose new challenges to the analysis of distributed executions. One important new characteristic is that the management staff of computing platforms and the developers of applications are separated by corporate boundaries. The net result is that once applications go wrong, the most readily available debugging aids for developers are the visible output of the application and any log files collected during their execution. In this paper, we propose the concept of task graphs as a foundation to represent distributed executions, and present a low overhead algorithm to infer task graphs from event log files. Intuitively, a task represents an autonomous segment of computation inside a thread. Edges between tasks represent their interactions and preserve programmers\u2019 notion of data and control flows. Our technique leverages existing logging support where available or otherwise augments it with aspect-based instrumentation to collect events of a set of predefined types. We show how task graphs can improve the precision of anomaly detection in a request-oriented analysis of field software and help programmers understand the running of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).",

The concentration of Ag in the sputtering-deposited AgTi layer on pure titanium was 13.9wt.%. The MAO coatings were prepared on the AgTi layers under different oxidation duration of 2, 5 and 8min. The size of the well-separated pores increased by increasing the oxidation duration. Metal Ag existed as Ag0 state was mainly distributed homogeneously inside the pores and the concentrations were 2.36, 2.05 and 1.50wt.%, respectively. The main TiO2 phases bearing Ca and P species appeared within the structure of the coatings were rutile and anatase. The Ag-containing coating oxidation for 5min showed excellent antibacterial activity of Escherichia coli (E.coli) within 24h and the antibacterial rate gradually raised with increasing contact time. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays can significantly enhance the functions of many cell types including osteoblasts thus having promising applications in orthopedics, orthodontics, as well as other biomedical fields. In this study, TiO2 NT arrays with Ag2O nanoparticle embedded in the nanotube wall (NT-Ag2O arrays) are prepared on titanium (Ti) by TiAg magnetron sputtering and anodization. Well-defined NT arrays containing Ag concentrations in a wide range from 0 to 15 at % are formed. Ag incorporation has little influence on the NT diameter, but significantly decreases the tube length. Crystallized Ag2O nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 5 nm to 20 nm are embedded in the amorphous TiO2 nanotube wall and this unique structure leads to controlled release of Ag(+) that generates adequate antibacterial activity without showing cytotoxicity. The NT-Ag2O arrays can effectively kill Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus even after immersion for 28 days, demonstrating the long lasting antibacterial ability. Furthermore, the NT-Ag2O arrays have no appreciable influence on the osteoblast viability, proliferation, and differentiation compared to the Ag free TiO2 NT arrays. Ag incorporation even shows some favorable effects on promoting cell spreading. The technique reported here is a versatile approach to develop biomedical coatings with different functions.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial adhesion to stainless steel surfaces is one of the major reason causing the cross-contamination and infection in many practical applications. An approach to solve this problem is to enhance the antibacterial properties on the surface of stainless steel. In this paper, novel antibacterial stainless steel surfaces with different copper content have been prepared by a plasma surface alloying technique at various gas pressures. The microstructure of the alloyed surfaces was investigated using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The viability of bacteria attached to the antibacterial surfaces was tested using the spread plate method. The antibacterial mechanism of the alloyed surfaces was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that gas pressure has a great influence on the surface elements concentration and the depth of the alloyed layer. The maximum copper concentration in the alloyed surface obtained at the gas pressure of 60 Pa is about 7.1 wt.%. This alloyed surface exhibited very strong antibacterial ability, and an effective reduction of 98% of Escherichia coli (E. coli) within 1 h was achieved by contact with the alloyed surface. The maximum thickness of the copper alloyed layer obtained at 45 Pa is about 6.5 \u03bcm. Although the rate of reduction for E. coli of this alloyed surface was slower than that of the alloyed surface with the copper content about 7.1 wt.% over the first 3 h, few were able to survive more than 12 h and the reduction reached over 99.9%. The XPS analysis results indicated that the copper ions were released when the copper alloyed stainless steel in contact with bacterial solution, which is an important factor for killing bacteria. Based on an overall consideration of bacterial killing rate and durability, the alloyed surface with the copper content of 2.5 wt.% and the thickness of about 6.5 \u03bcm obtained at the gas pressure of 45 Pa is expected to be useful as antimicrobial materials that may have a promising future in antimicrobial applications. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To prevent bacterial adhesion, a series of porous TiO2 coatings with different concentrations of silver (designated as M0, M1, M2 and M3) were prepared on pure titanium substrates by a duplex-treatment technique combining magnetron sputtering with micro-arc oxidation. All coatings are porous with pore size less than 5 \u03bcm and the concentrations of silver in the M0, M1, M2 and M3 are 0, 0.95, 1.36 and 1.93 wt.%, respectively. Silver is found to be distributed throughout the thickness of the coatings by scanning electron microscopy. The release of silver from the TiO2 coatings was confirmed by an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The antibacterial effects of these coatings were tested against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli), and the cytotoxicity was evaluated using the mouse pre-osteoblast cells. The results indicate that the antibacterial activities of TiO2 coatings are greatly improved due to the incorporation of silver. No cytotoxic effect is found for the M1 surfaces from the observation of pre-osteoblast cell by MTT assay and fluorescence microscopy. Although the M2 and M3 coatings appeared to be toxic for pre-osteoblast cells after 1 day in culture, the cell viability on M2 and M3 surfaces was greatly raised after culturing for 2 days. Our results suggested that the TiO2 coatings incorporated with an optimum amount of silver can possess excellent antibacterial activities without cytotoxic effect, which has promising applications in biomedical devices.",

XRD analysis of the Mo modified layer reveals that a Mo phase exists in the modified layer with <110> and <211> orientations in the subsurface. Corrosion-wear behaviors of Ti6Al4V substrate and Mo modified Ti6Al4V alloy sliding against corundum are investigated with the wear-electrochemical noise technique in a 0.5 mol/L NaCl solution.

        "abstract": "A Cu modified layer on AISI304 stainless steel was obtained using plasma surface alloying technique. Microstructure and composition of the modified layer were investigated by SEM and XRD. Friction and wear behavior of the modified layer sliding against different counterparts was investigated using a ball-on-disc tester in ambient air. Results show that the surface modified layer with the thickness of about 26 \u03bcm is uniform and dense. The layer is mainly composed of pure Cu, expanded austenite phase and a few Fe3O4 phase. Wear test results indicate that the tribological behavior of the modified layer depends on the counterparts. The Cu modified layer significantly improves the tribological properties of stainless steel sliding against GCr15, while higher wear rate and friction coefficient are obtained for sliding friction of the modified layer against Al2O3.",

        "abstract": "Using traditional methods to evaluate mechanical properties of bulk materials is not applicable for metal surface studying and metals with very small volume. Nanoindentation testing at very low load is a new successful technique for study of mechanical properties on small scales or near surfaces. However, so far there is not a robust approach to determine plastic properties of metal materials using nanoindentation test. The aim of this paper is to present a method for determining the plastic properties, e.g. the true plastic stress-true plastic strain relation of metals combining nanonindentation test and finite element simulation. This methodology contains three main parts. Firstly considering the special case of metals without strain hardening, the representative stress \u03c3r is determined by varying assumed representative stress over a wide range until the reverse and forward loading curves are consistent. Then, also by comparing the reverse and forward loading curves, the representative strain \u03b5r is obtained, but with different values of strain hardening exponent n, which are in the range of 0-0.6. Secondly, a series of simulations are performed for 124 combinations of each parameter (E,\u03c3y,n,v) expressing the elastic-plastic behaviors of the universal engineering metals. From the computational results, a dimensionless function \u03a0u is constructed, and then the strain hardening exponent is determined. At last, substituting the strain hardening exponent n into the power law constitution, the yield stress \u03c3y of metals is acquired. The examination of 5 kinds of metals from the forward analysis metal materials indicates that the dimensionless function \u03a0u has generality and the strain hardening exponent has stability and uniqueness. The accuracy of this method is also examined by comparing the elasto-plastic properties of practical metal AISI 304 steel obtained from nanoindentation test and finite element simulation with the tensile test results. In order to make the reverse analysis results get higher precision, in the practical application of this technique, the test error of nanoindentation should be maximally reduced. \u00a9 Copyright.",

        "abstract": "A multifaceted coating for hard tissue implants, with favorable osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and osteoimmunomodulation abilities, would be of great value since it could improve osseointegration and alleviate prosthesis loosening. However, to date there are few coatings that fully satisfy these criteria. Herein we describe a microporous TiO2 coating decorated with hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles that is generated by micro-arc oxidation of pure titanium (Ti) and followed annealing. By altering the annealing temperature, it is possible to simultaneously tune the coating's physical (morphology and wettability) and chemical (composites and crystallinity) properties. A coating produced with micro-arc oxidization (MAO) with an annealing temperature of 650\u202f\u00b0C (MAO-650) exhibits numerous favorable physicochemical properties, such as hybrid micro-nano morphology, superhydrophilicity, and highly crystalline HA nanoparticles. In vitro experiments reveal that the MAO-650 coating not only supports proliferation and differentiation of both osteoblasts and endothelial cells, but also inhibits the inflammatory response of macrophages and enables a favorable osteoimmunomodulation to facilitate osteo/angio-genesis. In vivo evaluation mirrors these results, and shows that the MAO-650 coating results in ameliorative osseointegration when compared with the pristine MAO coating. These data highlight the profound effect of surface physicochemical properties on the regulation of osteo/angio-genesis and osteoimmunomodulation in the enhancement of osseointegration.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory reactions and the functionality of endothelial cells (ECs) on the surfaces of coronary stents are critical in the prevention of in-stent restenosis and subsequent neoatherosclerosis. However, the interactions between immune cells and ECs on modified coronary stent surfaces have long been underestimated. In the present study, silicon (Si)-doped titania nanotube arrays (TNA-Sis) were obtained via the facile anodization of magnetron-sputtered Ti-Si coatings. The synergetic effects of titania nanotube arrays (TNAs) and chemical cues (Si) on the functionality of macrophages (M\u03a6s)/ECs and their cross-talk were investigated. The results indicated that TNA-Sis specimens, in comparison with TNAs alone, not only promoted the initial vitality of ECs, enhanced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO), and activated multiple cell signaling pathways (vWF, PECAM, eNOS), but also induced a favorable immune response through the polarization of M\u03a6s to a pro-healing M2 phenotype via the activation of cell autophagy, resulting in the downregulation of inflammatory reactions. This beneficial immune response further facilitated cross-talk between ECs and M\u03a6s, resulting in profoundly increased functionality of ECs on TNA-Sis surfaces. This study demonstrated that using TNA-Sis surface coatings for coronary stents may be a promising strategy to prevent in-stent restenosis.",

Our results show amorphous and highly ordered NTs with diameter of 50nm, length of 800nm, and Ni/Ti ratio (at %) of 0.35 can be fabricated in ethylene glycol electrolyte supplemented with 0.2 wt.% NH4F and 0.5 vol.% H2O at 30\u00b0C and 25V for 1h. Electrochemical experiments indicate that at an applied potential of 0.60V vs. Ag/AgCl, the electrode exhibits a linear response window for glucose concentrations from 0.002mM to 0.2mM with a response time of 10s, detection limit of 0.13\u03bcM (S/N=3), and sensitivity of 83\u03bcAmM(-1)cm(-2).

In this article, Cu-Ti-O nanotubes with different Cu contents are fabricated on sputtered TiCu films. Scanning electron microscopy reveals the NTs can be formed on sputtered TiCu films when the Cu content is less than 14.6 at %. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate the NTs are consist of CuO mixed with TiO2 and the Cu content in NTs decreases dramatically compared with that in TiCu films. Biological experiments show that although these NTs have poor release antibacterial activity, their contact antibacterial activity has proven to be excellent, indicating the NT surface can effectively inhibit biomaterial-associated infections. The cytocompatibility of the NTs is closely related to the Cu content and when its content is relatively low (1.01 at %), there is no appreciable cytotoxicity. So Cu-Ti-O NTs with 1 at % Cu may be suitable to achieve proper antibacterial activity and desired cytocompatibility. The Cu-Ti-O NTs integrate the favorable antibacterial activity of Cu and excellent biological properties of TiO2 NTs therefore have potential applications in orthopedics, dentistry, and other biomedical fields.",

In the microindentation process, acoustic emission testing was adopted in order to investigate cracking of the Mo modified layer. Nanoindentation tests were performed not only on the cross section of the Mo modified Ti, but on the surface of the untreated Ti plate (before alloying treatment). The experimental results indicate that the whole Mo modified layer possesses higher hardness, elastic modulus and remains relatively fine plasticity.

In the present work, we systemically investigated the influence of various anodization parameters on the formation and structure of Ni-Ti-O NTAs and their potential applications. Our results show that well controlled NTAs can be fabricated during relatively wide ranges of the anodization voltage (5-90\u2005V), electrolyte temperature (10-50\u00b0C) and electrolyte NH4F content (0.025-0.8\u2005wt%) but within a narrow window of the electrolyte H2O content (0.0-1.0\u2005vol%). Through modulating these parameters, the Ni-Ti-O NTAs with different diameter (15-70\u2005nm) and length (45-1320\u2005nm) can be produced in a controlled manner. Regarding potential applications, the Ni-Ti-O NTAs may be used as electrodes for electrochemical energy storage and non-enzymic glucose detection, and may constitute nanoscaled biofunctional coating to improve the biological performance of NiTi based biomedical implants.",

Based on this definition, a good approach was proposed to extract the plastic properties or constitutive equations of metals from nanoindentation test combining finite element simulation. Firstly, without consideration of strain hardening, the representative stress was determined by varying assumed representative stress over a wide range until a good agreement was reached between the computed and experimental loading curves. Similarly, the corresponding representative strain was determined with different hypothetical values of strain hardening exponent in the range of 0-0.6. Through modulating assumed strain hardening exponent values to make the computed unloading curve coincide with that of the experiment,the real strain hardening exponent was acquired. Once the strain hardening exponent was determined, the initial yield stress \u03c3y of metals could be obtained by the power law constitution. The validity of the proposed methodology was verified by three real metals:AISI 304 steel, Fe and Al alloy.",

One attractive application of clean hydrogen is to be utilized as a fuel in hydrogen fuel cells. Due to the better stability of earth-abundant electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions and the emerging hydroxide-exchange membranes, hydrogen fuel cells utilizing alkaline electrolytes become an appealing alternative to proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline condition has hindered its rapid commercialization. Herein, we report a low-cost Ni/NiO/C catalyst with abundant Ni/NiO interfacial sites as a competent HOR electrocatalyst in alkaline media. Ni/NiO/C exhibits an HOR activity one order of magnitude higher than that of its parent Ni/C counterpart measured under the same conditions. Moreover, Ni/NiO/C also shows better stability and CO tolerance than commercial Pt/C in alkaline media which renders it a very promising HOR electrocatalyst for hydrogen fuel cell applications. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to shed light on the enhanced HOR performance of Ni/NiO/C and our DFT results indicate that both hydrogen and hydroxide achieve optimal binding energies at the Ni/NiO interface, resulting from the balanced electronic and oxophilic effects at the Ni/NiO interface.",

However, the lack of antibacterial advantage has limited their use in practical application. In this paper, antibacterial stainless steel surfaces with different Cu contents have been prepared by plasma surface alloying technology (PSAT). The steel surface with Cu content 90 wt.% (Cu-SS) exhibits strong bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) within 3 h. Although the Cu-containing surface with Cu content 2.5 wt.% (CuNi-SS) can also kill all tested bacteria, this process needs 12 h. SEM observation of the bacterial morphology and an agarose gel electrophoresis were performed to study the antibacterial mechanism of Cu-containing stainless steel surfaces against E. coli. The results indicated that Cu ions are released when the Cu-containing surfaces are in contact with bacterial and disrupt the cell membranes, killing the bacteria. The toxicity of Cu-alloyed surfaces does not cause damage to the bacterial DNA. These results provide a scientific explanation for the antimicrobial applications of Cu-containing stainless steel. The surfaces with different antibacterial abilities could be used as hygienic surfaces in healthcare-associated settings according to the diverse requirement of bactericidal activities. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The results show rhombohedral NiTiO nanosheets with thickness of 6\u202fnm can be grown at 200\u202f\u00b0C. Hydrothermal treatment enhances the corrosion resistance of the NiTi alloy. 30\u202fmin of the treatment significantly reduces Ni ion release, while prolonged hydrothermal time results in increased Ni ion release because of the growth of the nanosheets with large specific surface area. Excitingly, the nanosheets can well support cell growth, which suggests the release amount can be well tolerated. Good corrosion resistance and cytocompatibility combined with large specific surface area render the nanosheets promising as safe and efficient drug carriers of the biomedical NiTi alloy.",

The microstructure, chemical composition and the change of the chemical state of copper on the surface of the duplex treated stainless steel were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), glow discharge optical emission spectroscope (GDOES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS). The results show that the antibacterial rates gradually rise with increase of the contact time between the bacteria and the copper-alloyed stainless steel, and the alloyed surface exhibits excellent antibacterial properties against both E.coli and S.aureus within 12 h. The copper concentration on the alloyed surface reaches to 5.7wt% and the thickness of the alloyed layer is about 2.7 \u03bcm. XPS analysis indicated that Cu ions was released when the copper-alloyed surface contacted with bacterial solution, which led to death of the bacteria.",

        "abstract": "We describe a strategy to fabricate a hydrogel-based microvascular construct by direct writing alginate bioink inside the viscous pre-polymer of hydrogels, which acts as a support bath. As the print needle translates through the polymers, the extruded alginate instantaneously forms calcium alginate hydrogel (Ca-Alg) templates deposited within the bath. This phase change allows the formed templates to be anchored within the pre-polymers, while maintaining their structure. After the printing process, the pre-polymers are solidified to form a mechanically robust hydrogel. Finally, a hydrogel construct with embedded microchannels is generated by liquefying and removing the Ca-Alg templates. Using this method, not only the alginate ink alone can be directly printed within the engineered constructs, but also the size and shape of the formed microchannels are controllable. Furthermore, a confluent endothelial layer for the generation of vascular networks can be constructed by adhering and proliferating endothelial cells on the channel linings. This strategy demonstrates a promising technique for rapid construction of in vitro vasculatures, which would provide a versatile platform for a wide array of applications such as tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip and drug screening.",

Length-dependent corrosion behavior, nickel ion (Ni) release, cytocompatibility, and antibacterial ability were investigated by electrochemical, analytical chemistry, and biological methods. The results show constructing nanoporous structure on the NiTi alloy improve its corrosion resistance. However, the anodized samples release more Ni than that of the bare NiTi alloy, suggesting chemical dissolution of the nanopores rather than electrochemical corrosion governs the Ni release. In addition, the Ni release amount increases with nanopore length. The anodized samples show good cytocompatibility when the nanopore length is <11\u202f\u03bcm. Encouragingly, the length scale covers the one (1-11\u202f\u03bcm) that the nanopores showing favorable antibacterial ability. Consequently, the nanopores with length in the range of 1-11\u202f\u03bcm are promising as coatings of biomedical NiTi alloy for anti-infection, drug delivery, and other desirable applications.",

Recent advances unravel that immune response of macrophages and its manipulated osteoimmunomodulation also exerts a pivotal role to determine the fate of the implant. Surface nano-micro modification has evidenced to be efficient to influence osteogenesis, however, little is known links nano-microstructured surface to immune response, as well the osteoimmunomodulation. This study demonstrates that the nano-particles decorated micro-surface, compared with the nano-rods decorated micro-surface enables osteogenesis and angiogenesis concurrently that has not been investigated previously. This study also unravels that the immune response of macrophages can be manipulated by the nano-micro surface, especially the nano-dimension matters, leading to a differential effect on osteointegration.

        "abstract": "Bacterial infection and loosening of orthopedic implants remain two disastrously postoperative complications. Angiogenesis is critical important to facilitate implant osseointegration in vivo. TiO nanotubes arrays (NTAs) with proper dimensions possess good osseointegration ability. Accordingly, the present work incorporated copper (Cu) into TiO NTAs (Cu-Ti-O NTAs) to enhance their antibacterial ability and angiogenesis activity, which was realized through anodizing magnetron-sputtered TiCu coatings with different Cu contents on pure titanium (Ti). Our results show ordered Cu-Ti-O NTAs can be produced under proper Cu content (<15.14%) in TiCu coatings. The NTAs possess excellent long-term antibacterial ability against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which may be ascribed to sustained release of Cu. The cytotoxicity of Cu-Ti-O NTAs to endothelial cells (ECs) could be negligible and can even promote cell proliferation as revealed by live/dead staining and MTT. Meanwhile, Cu-Ti-O NTAs can up-regulate nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) secretion of ECs on the sample surfaces compared with that of pure TiO NTAs (control). Furthermore, the angiogenic activity is also enhanced in ionic extracts of Cu-Ti-O NTAs compared with the control. The excellent long-term antibacterial ability and favorable angiogenic activity render Cu-Ti-O NTAs to be promising implant coatings.",

        "abstract": "Biomedical titanium (Ti) implants with good anti-infective, osteogenic, and angiogenic properties are in great demand. SrTiO nanotubes (NTs) are embedded with silver oxide (AgO) nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as NT-Sr-Ag) by a hydrothermal treatment of TiO NTs containing AgO NPs (denoted as NT-Ag) in a Sr(OH) solution. The morphology, composition, microstructure, ion release phenomenon, as well as antibacterial, osteogenic, and angiogenic activities are investigated in details. During the hydrothermal treatment, the amorphous TiO in the NTs morphs into cubic SrTiO gradually and the ordered nanotubular architecture is preserved. Some AgO NPs are incorporated into the structure although some of them dissolve in the solution. Long-term bacterial resistance against Staphylococcus aureus is observed as a result of the prolonged and controllable Ag release. NT-Sr-Ag can also release Sr similarly to stimulate osteoblasts to secrete the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Both the released Sr and secreted VEGF upregulate the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and extracellular matrix mineralization of osteoblasts. Furthermore, better angiogenic activity is observed when endothelial cells are cultured in NT-Sr-Ag conditioned media when compared with that in NT-Ag conditioned media, which is believed to be ascribed to the positive regulation of VEGF secretion of Sr. NT-2Sr-Ag and NT-3Sr-Ag (Hydrothermal treatment for 2 and 3h, respectively) exhibit excellent antibacterial, osteogenic, and angiogenic activities and are promising in biomedical implants.",

Developing silicon (Si) doped TiO2 nanotube array (TNA-Si) coatings shall be a promising strategy to yield favorable implant osseointegration with the combined effects of TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) and Si in the enhancement of both osteogenic and angiogenic activities. To achieve this purpose, TNA-Sis are fabricated through the unique strategy of anodization of magnetron-sputtered TiSi coatings. Under optimized conditions, a highly ordered nanotubular structure with even dispersion of Si throughout the nanotubes in the form of SiO2 can be obtained. Si incorporation has little influence on the nanotube length, but slightly decreases the diameter, thickens the nanotube wall, and increases the hydrophilicity. TNA-Sis show good cytocompatibility to both osteoblasts and endothelial cells (ECs). TNA-Sis show enhanced proliferation, spreading, alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen secretion, and matrix mineralization of osteoblasts. Meanwhile, TNA-Sis induce better EC proliferation, and the conditioned culture media from TNA-Sis generate better angiogenic ability, nitric oxide production, and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion from ECs. In particular, TNA-Si4.6 with the strongest osteogenic and angiogenic activities in the context of the present study is highly promising as the next-generation hard tissue implant coating.",

By applying an anodization voltage of 10\u00a0V to the EG solutions containing 5.0\u201311.0\u00a0vol% H 2 O and 0.125\u20130.75\u00a0M HCl, Ni-Ti-O nanopores with a diameter of about 70\u00a0nm are produced. The nanopore length increases almost linearly with anodization time and by optimizing the experimental conditions, nanopores with a length of 160\u00a0\u03bcm can be prepared.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We report on a new electrolyte system to fabricate Ni-Ti-O nanopores with small diameter and high Ni content by anodizing nearly equiatomic NiTi alloy. In the electrolyte composed of ethylene glycol, 5\u202fvol% H 2 O, and 0.23\u20130.9\u202fwt% Na 2 CO 3 , uniform Ni-Ti-O nanopores with diameter of about 25\u202fnm and Ni/Ti atomic ratio exceeding 0.30 can be anodically grown on the NiTi alloy under proper applied voltage (20\u201340\u202fV). The small diameter (high specific surface area) and high Ni content enable the nanopores promising in electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis, gas/bio-sensing, and other emerging fields.",

The film fabricated in the NaCl-containing electrolyte are much thinner than those prepared in the HCl-containing electrolyte under similar experimental conditions, implying proper amount of H +  in the electrolyte accelerates formation of the nanopores. Moreover, the experimental conditions to grow Ni-Ti-O nanoporous film on NiTi are not proper for pure Ti and Ni. The film of 1.9\u00a0\u03bcm in thickness exhibits good cytocompatibility thus is suitable for biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This work provides an environmental friendly route to fabricate ternary silver/silver oxide/zinc oxide (Ag/Ag 2 O/ZnO) photocatalyst with assistance of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The structural analysis indicates that Ag/Ag 2 O/ZnO photocatalyst is a 3D-flowerlike architecture. Nanoparticles composed of Ag and Ag 2 O in diameter about 40\u2009nm attach on the surfaces of ZnO \u201cpetals\u201d and form a heterojunction structure with ZnO. The ultraviolet-visible (UV\u2013vis) spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra show that the obtained Ag/Ag 2 O/ZnO nanocomposite displays an enhanced visible-light absorption and a decreased fluorescence emission compared to that of ZnO. The photocatalytic performance of Ag/Ag 2 O/ZnO nanocomposite was evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under simulated visible light irradiation. The results indicate that Ag/Ag 2 O/ZnO nanocomposite exhibits better photocatalytic activity than that of single- and two-component photocatalysts including ZnO, Ag 2 O, TiO 2  and Ag/ZnO. Ag/Ag 2 O/ZnO nanocomposite also has a good recycling stability and still maintains a high degradation efficiency (85%) after four recycles. The improved photocatalytic activity is credited to the synergistic effect of Ag, Ag 2 O and ZnO nanophases in the Ag/Ag 2 O/ZnO heterojunction, which results in an effective charge separation and a low recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs.",

        "abstract": "Implant-associated infection and poor osseointegration remains a major clinical challenge in Ti-based implant materials. A versatile strategy to endow Ti-based implants with long-term antibacterial ability as well as better osteogenic activity is highly desirable for high quality implantation. Strontium (Sr) has been shown to be a significant element to favor bone growth by promoting new bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption. In this study, a novel duplex-treatment technique encompassing magnetron sputtering with micro-arc oxidation is utilized to fabricate porous Sr/Ag-containing TiO2 coatings loaded with different concentrations of Ag and Sr. All coatings are porous with pore size less than 5 \u00b5m. Ag is primarily distributed homogeneously inside the pores, and the concentrations of Ag in Sr/Ag-containing TiO2 coatings with low and high Ag contents are 0.40 at.% and 0.83 at.% respectively. We have demonstrated that this kind of coating displays long-lasting antibacterial ability even up to 28 d due to the incorporation of Ag. Further, Sr/Ag-containing TiO2 coatings with optimum Ag and Sr contents revealed good cytocompatibility, enhanced osteoblast spreading and osseointegration, which stemmed primarily from the synergistic effect exerted by the porous surface topography and the bioactive element Sr. However, this study has also identified, for the first time, that proper addition of Ag would further facilitate osteogenic effects. Besides, Sr may be able to alleviate the potential cytotoxic effect of excessive Ag. Thus, integration of optimum functional elements Ag and Sr into Ti-based implant materials would be expected to expedite osseointegration while simultaneously sustaining long-term antibacterial activity, which would provide new insights for relevant fundamental investigations and biomedical applications.

The element concentration, microstructure and elastoplastic properties are investigated with glow-discharge optical emission spectroscope (GDOES), scanning electron microscope, optical microscope (OM) and nanoindenter. Engaging with 41Cr4 steel gears, the wear resistances of the treated and untreated TC4 spur gears are evaluated through running-in and operation tests performed by a friction and wear tester under lubricated conditions. By finite element analysis, contact stress distributions in the TC4 and 41Cr4 spur gears pair are quantitatively determined. The results indicate that, being compact and uniform, the Mo-modified layer has higher hardness and retains relatively fine plasticity. The wear resistance of the treated TC4 spur gear is improved significantly.",

Silver is found to be doped into TiO2 nanowire evenly and mainly exists in the zerovalent state. The AgNW arrays show excellent efficient antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli), and all of the bacteria can be killed within 1 h. Additionally, the AgNW arrays can still kill E. coli after immersion for 60 days, suggesting the long-term antibacterial property.

In this work, an ZrO/TiO alloyed layer was prepared on TC4 by plasma surface alloying with Zr and subsequently annealed in the air for improved corrosion and wear resistant. To assess the corrosion performance of the alloyed layer, the specimens were measured by open circuit potential, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization in simulated body fluid solution. The result shows that the ZrO/TiO alloyed layer exhibits strikingly high polarization resistance, wide passive region and very low current density, indicating the excellent corrosion resistance. The layer also displays significant improvement of wear resistance. Furthermore, the alloyed layer restricts cell adhesion and spreading. We infer that the ZrO/TiO alloyed layer might be potentially useful implanted devices such as biosensors, bioelectronics or drug delivery devices.",

In this work, the behavior of osteoblasts and endothelial cells on nano-structured Zr and micro/nano-structured ZrO alloyed layers of Ti-6Al-4V (TC4) was investigated. Zr alloyed layer (Zr@TC4) decreases the hydrophilicity whereas ZrO alloyed layers (ZrO@TC4) is more hydrophilic than TC4 and more proteins adsorb on ZrO@TC4 followed by Zr@TC4. The cells proliferate steadily on the smooth TC4 and nano-structured Zr@TC4 surfaces and the osteoblast activity is more pronounced on Zr@TC4 than TC4. The micro/nano-structured surface on ZrO@TC4 restricts cellular adhesion and spreading independent of the surface wettability and protein adsorption. The findings provide insights into the design of micro/nano-structured biomaterials and interfaces with controlled tissue response.",

However, the antibacterial efficacy of medical device implants must necessarily be balanced by good corrosion resistance and the corrosion behavior of the antibacterial coatings has seldom been reported. In this work, Zn-incorporated antibacterial TiO 2  coating was produced on pure titanium (Ti) by micro-arc oxidization (MAO) and the electrochemical behavior was assessed. The results obtained from the antibacterial studies suggest that the Zn-incorporated TiO 2  coating provides bactericidal activity against both Gram-negative  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ) and Gram-positive  Staphylococcus aureus  ( S. aureus ) over 90%. The corrosion behavior of Zn-incorporated TiO 2  coating were investigated using a combination of complementary electrochemical measurement techniques such as open circuit potential (OCP), potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the Zn-incorporated TiO 2  coating move the OCP to the positive direction and increase the polarization resistance, thereby enhances the corrosion resistance of pure Ti. Collectively, the Zn-incorporated TiO 2  coating with both antibacterial ability and anti-corrosive properties might be more suitable for biomedical surfaces.",

To improve the antibacterial activity and bioactivity, many strategies have recently focused on the modification of the surface composition and topography of titanium. However, relatively few efforts have been made to further enhance the antibacterial activity of a hierarchical micro/nano-structure. In this work, Ag-containing hierarchical hybrid micro/nano-structure was formed on titanium surface by magnetron sputtering, micro-arc oxidation and hydrothermal treatment for the first time. The unique nanoscale petal-shaped structure was formed on the micro-structured TiO 2  coating surface after hydrothermal treatment and uniformly distributed on the porous titanium surface. The resulting surface displays good antibacterial property against  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ). The synthesis method is a viable approach for improving the surface property of titanium-based biomedical devices.",

Firstly, a Zr alloyed layer was prepared on 316L\u00a0SS by using plasma surface alloying technique. And then, a ZrO 2  alloyed layer was obtained on the Zr alloyed layer after annealing at 850\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h.

The microstructure, biocompatibility, corrosion resistance and antibacterial property of TiO 2 /CuO coating were investigated in comparison with pure Ti and TiO 2  coating. The results show that TiO 2 /CuO coating is mainly composed of TiO 2  and CuO. In vitro cytocompatibility evaluation suggests that no obvious toxicity appears on the TiO 2 /CuO coating, and the coating stimulates the osteoblast spreading and proliferation. Compared with Ti and TiO 2  coating, TiO 2 /CuO coating exhibits improved corrosion resistance and antibacterial ability against S.aureus. This study is the first attempt to apply the combination of magnetron sputtering and annealing treatment to introduce the Cu into TiO 2  coating for surface modification of Ti-based implant materials, which may provide a research foundation for further development of bioactive multifunctional coatings to meet the better clinical demand.",

        "abstract": "Osseointegration is crucial for early fixation as well as for long-term implantation success, hence numerous efforts have been made to tune the surface topography or chemical composition of biomedical implants to improve osseointegration. In this work, various nanostructures, including nanoflocs, nanobundles, nanorods, and nanoleaves, were introduced to the surface of silicon (Si)-incorporated microporous structure to form Si-incorporated micro-nano hierarchical structures on titanium (Ti)-based implants. The osseointegration of the implants were systemically assessed in vivo and in vitro. The in vitro evaluations showed that the nanostructures promoted the protein adsorption, thus modulating the early cellular responses, including the attachment and spreading of osteoblasts and human endothelial cells (HUVECs), and subsequent cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, compared with the single microporous structure, the nanostructures located over the microporous structure protected the Si ions from quick release and allowed the long-term sustained Si-ions release, which further contributed to the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion as well as the tube formation of HUVECs. Collectively, the favorable nano-surface structures, especially the nanoleaves structure, and the constant Si-ion release together led to robust osteogenic and angiogenic activities. More importantly, in vivo micro-CT evaluation and histological observations further verified that the Si-incorporated micro-nano hierarchical implant with nanoleaves structure could efficiently promote new bone formation, thus indicating it was an attractive candidate as a next-generation bone-implant material.",

The corrosion behavior of TiO 2 -Mg nanotubes was studied in simulated body fluid solution using open circuit potentials (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization tests. The high polarization resistance and open circuit potentials of TiO 2 -Mg nanotubes indicate the formation of highly stable TiO 2  layer in simulated body fluid than that of titanium layer on magnesium alloy (Ti-Mg).

In this work, an ZrO/TiO alloyed layer was prepared on TC4 by plasma surface alloying with Zr and subsequently annealed in the air for improved corrosion and wear resistant. To assess the corrosion performance of the alloyed layer, the specimens were measured by open circuit potential, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization in simulated body fluid solution. The result shows that the ZrO/TiO alloyed layer exhibits strikingly high polarization resistance, wide passive region and very low current density, indicating the excellent corrosion resistance. The layer also displays significant improvement of wear resistance. Furthermore, the alloyed layer restricts cell adhesion and spreading. We infer that the ZrO/TiO alloyed layer might be potentially useful implanted devices such as biosensors, bioelectronics or drug delivery devices.",

However, bacterial infection after implant placement is still one of the significant rising complications. Therefore, the application of the antimicrobial agents into implant surfaces to prevent implant-associated infection has attracted much attention. Scientific papers have shown that inorganic antibacterial metal elements (e.g., Ag, Cu, Zn) can be introduced into implant surfaces with the addition of metal nanoparticles or metallic compounds into an electrolyte via micro-arc oxidation (MAO) technology. In this review, the effects of the composition and concentration of electrolyte and process parameters (e.g., voltage, current density, oxidation time) on the morphological characteristics (e.g., surface morphology, bonding strength), antibacterial ability and biocompatibility of MAO antimicrobial coatings are discussed in detail. Anti-infection and osseointegration can be simultaneously accomplished with the selection of the proper antibacterial elements and operating parameters. Besides, MAO assisted by magnetron sputtering (MS) to endow Ti-based implant materials with superior antibacterial ability and biocompatibility is also discussed. Finally, the development trend of MAO technology in the future is forecasted.",

We report a facile and a highly efficient strategy to inhibit thrombosis and bacteria attachment, by immobilizing heparin (HA) and chitosan (CS) on titanium (Ti). Alkali-treatment was firstly performed on Ti to form nanoporous network structures containing hydroxyl radical (-OH), followed by immobilizing HA and CS on alkali-treated Ti in turn by layer-by-layer assembly. HA was immobilized on alkali-treated surface by covalent immobilization and CS was immobilized on heparinized surface by electrostatic bonding. The successful immobilization of both HA and CS on Ti was confirmed by analyses of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angles. The antithrombotic activities of the immobilized surfaces were demonstrated by a reduction in protein absorption, blood clot mass and platelet adhesion. Additionally, the immobilized surfaces also exhibited excellent antibacterial activities against both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The modified surfaces on Ti was established as an effective and promising method to simultaneous improve the hemocompatibility and antibacterial performances of blood contact medical device.",

In this study, we fabricated a Zn-incorporated micro/nano-textured surface by one-step high current anodization (HCA) in an aqueous solution with 10g/L of NaOH and different concentrations of Zn(NO) (4, 7, and 12g/L). The control group of Zn-free was fabricated in the electrolyte of 7g/L Zn(NO). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) were used to analyze the morphology, composition, microstructure, and Zn release kinetics of the micro/nano-textured coatings. The biological properties of the surface structure were evaluated by cytotoxicity assay, cell viability, cytoskeletal assembly and alkaline phosphatase activity. Our results show the micro/nano-textured surface is composed of TiO mesoporous arrays, into which the Zn is demonstrated to be incorporated in the form of ZnO. The Zn content in the surface and release level of Zn can be tailored through varying Zn(NO) concentration in the electrolyte. In addition, the surface oxide layers show good interfacial bonding strength to the substrate. Compared with pure Ti and anodized Zn-free samples, the Zn-incorporated surface can upregulate osteoblast functions such as proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity, which are assayed by MTT and ALP staining experiments, respectively. Collectively, this micro/nano-textured structure combined with high interfacial bonding strength and release of Zn render the material surface promising as orthopedic implant coatings.",

In this study, a biomimetic mesoporous coating imbedded with strontium (MPs-Sr) is prepared by the high current anodization (HCA) and hydrothermal treatment (HT). This coating provides a more stable mechanical performance than the conventional nanotube arrays. The Sr loading is regulated by the HT reaction time and the Sr is released in a controllable manner from the MPs-Sr surface. The hydrophilic performance of MPs-Sr are significantly improved. Furthermore, it is showed that the attachment and spreading of preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells are significantly up-regulated by the nanoscale topology of MPs and the doped Sr. The improved collagen secretion and matrix mineralization levels of cells are closely related with the Sr release. The excellent osteogenic properties of MPs-Sr samples highlight their promising potential for use in clinical application.",

        "abstract": "To mimic the hierarchical structure of bone tissues, a hybrid micro/nano-textured titanium surface with Si-doped TiO mesoporous arrays is fabricated by a one-step high current anodization (HCA). Specifically, the HCA is carried out in a electrolyte containing NO and SiO. The NO in the electrolyte is demonstrated to play a key role in mediating the formation of honeycombed TiO mesoporous arrays, which are different than the nanotubes formed by the mediating of F ion in the conventional anodization. This unique structure endows the coating with improved mechanical properties compared to the nanotube layer. In addition, the Si is incorporated into the coating in a concentration-dependent manner. With the increase of Si doping amount in the coating, both the hydrophilic properties and surface free energy of coatings are obviously enhanced. The cell culture test shows that the osteoblast behaviors on this surface are positively influenced by the doped Si. Therefore, this micro/nano-textured surface coating doped with Si may endow the Ti-based implants long-term stability and good osseointegration.",

This layer is composed of micro-pits and nano-porous arrays in the honeycomb structure. The results show that both the roughness and the layer thickness are related to the reaction time, whereas the size of nano-pores has little to do with the anodization duration. Compared to the nano-tubular arrays constructed by the conventional anodization, this nano-porous layer shows significantly improved mechanical stability. Furthermore, the in vitro assay of osteoblasts shows that cells behaviors on this surface can be modulated by the topology of this special layer. A suitable hierarchical structure composed of micro-pits and nano-porous structure can significantly stimulate osteoblasts attachment, activity, spreading and ALP function. Therefore, this hierarchical surface layer may provide a promising approach, which endows the Ti-based implants with better stability and osseointegration.",

In the impact test, four loads of 100, 300, 500, and 700\u00a0N and 10 impacts were adopted. The three-dimensional residual impact dents were examined using an optical microscope (Olympus-DSX500i), indicating that the impact resistance of the Ti surface was improved. Two failure modes cohesive and wearing were elucidated by electron backscatter diffraction and energy-dispersive spectrometer performed in a field-emission scanning electron microscope. Through finite element forward analysis performed at a typical impact load of 300\u00a0N, stress-strain distributions in the Mo-modified Ti were quantitatively determined. In addition, the failure behavior of the Mo-modified layer was determined and an ideal failure model was proposed for high-load impact, based on the experimental and finite element forward analysis results.",

The biological experiments indicate that Zn-ZrO/TiO coatings exhibit not only excellent antibacterial property against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), but also favorable cytocompatibility. In addition, the corrosion resistance of the coating is also appreciably improved in the simulated body fluids (SBF), which can ensure better biocompatibility in body fluids.",

The Cu NPs coated samples exhibit excellent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). In vitro cytocompatibility evaluation discloses that 0 Cu and 0.3 Cu have no toxicity to osteoblasts but 3.0 Cu shows cytotoxicity. 0.3 Cu promotes proliferation and adhesion of osteoblasts and enhances extracellular matrix mineralization (ECM), but has little effects on the alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and collagen secretion. Surprisingly, the Cu NPs coated samples show a different behavior with endothelial cells. Both 0.3 Cu and 3.0 Cu show no cytotoxicity on endothelial cells and promote cell proliferation. Production of nitric oxide (NO) and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the endothelial cells are observed from the Cu NPs doped TiO coatings.",

The content of water - insoluble glucan and water - soluble glucan were measured by anthrone method. The data was statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA using SAS9.0 software package. Results: The glucosyltransferase activity and the concentration of extra -cellular glucan decreased gradually with the increase of concentration of lemon peel extracts,and there were highly significant differences (P<0.01) in the groups of 0.078 \u03bcl/ml with 1.250 \u03bcl/ml lemon peel extracts. There were highly significant differences of extra-cellular glucan between each experimental group and control group (P <0.01), and between glucosyltransferase activity or specific activity of each experimental group and control group as well (P<0.01).There was positive correlation between glucosyltransferase activity and water- insoluble glucan content (r=0.825\uff5e0.963 P<0.01),and between glucosyltransferase activity and water- soluble glucan content as well(r=0.815\uff5e0.950,P<0.01), and there were highly significant differences of two correlations (t=4.37, P<0.01). Conclusion: Lemon peel extracts could inhibit the glucosyltransferase activity, extra - cellular synthesis of water - insoluble and water- soluble glucan of Streptococcus mutans.",

The LPE was used as the experimental group with concentrations ranging from 2.250 g/L to 0.281 g/L prepared with trypticase peptone yeast (TPY) culture medium, and TPY culture medium was used as the control group. Ss at the concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml was added to each group, and cultured for 6, 18, 24, 48 hours. Neson-Somogyi method was used to measure the content of reducing sugar, and glucosyltransferase (GTF) activity. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured by lactic acid and pyruvic acid continuous monitoring method. The content of water insoluble glucan (WIG) was measured by anthrone method, and the pH value of the culture solution was detected. The value of pH before the experiment and the time difference was alculated as \u0394pH.At the same time point, the activity of GTF and LDH and the concentration of WIG and the value \u0394pH decreased gradually with the increase of concentration of LPE. There were significant differences between each experimental group and control group (P < 0.01).

Sm was added to each group, which was then cultured for 6, 18, 24 and 48 hours in the anaerobic tank. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) was measured with the method of oxidation of reduction coenzymeIand the pH value of the culture solution was also detected. The activity of the sucrose was determined with the method of coloration of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid.The activity of LDH, sucrase and the changes of solution pH were decreased with the increase of the concentration of LPE (P < 0.01). The activity of LDH were declined from (0.8025 \u00b1 0.0913) \u00d7 10(3) U/L to (0.2099 \u00b1 0.0283) \u00d7 10(3) U/L; the activity of sucrase were declined from (-0.0107 \u00b1 0.0003) \u00d7 10(3) U/L to (-0.0078 \u00b1 0.0002) \u00d7 10(3) U/L; the \u0394pH were declined from (2.8067 \u00b1 0.0404) to (2.5033 \u00b1 0.0416) (24 h results). The differences were significant between experimental groups and the control group (P < 0.01), and there were also significant differences among experimental groups with different LPE concentration (P < 0.01). The inhibitory effect of acid generation and lactate dehydrogenas' activity of Sm were positively correlated (P < 0.01).LPE can inhibit the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, sucrase and the acid production capacity of the Sm in a dose dependent manner. The inhibitory effects in logarithmic phase is stronger than that in other phases of growth cycle.",

        "abstract": "Anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and is frequently treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating proteins (ESPs). Previous studies, however, have been relatively short in duration and have not provided conclusive data on the safety or clinical efficacy of ESP treatment. The aim of this study was to explore the safety and therapeutic effects of ESPs in patients with anemia and CHF. A systematic literature search in EMBASE and MEDLINE from their inception to July 2013 was performed, and clinical studies that evaluated the effects of ESPs among patients with CHF were identified. Randomized clinical trials comparing the effects of ESP treatment with those of placebo treatment or usual care regimes in anemic patients with CHF were included. Nine randomized, controlled trials were identified, comprising 750 patients with CHF and anemia receiving ESP treatment for between three months and one year. ESP treatment had a significantly lower risk of CHF hospitalization [relative risk (RR), 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.32-0.70; P=0.0002] and a moderate reduction in mortality risk (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.38-1.19; P=0.18). Treatment with ESPs in patients with symptomatic CHF and anemia resulted in significant improvements in hemoglobin, hematocrit and brain natriuretic peptide levels, as well as exercise capacity, renal function, New York Heart Association class and left ventricular ejection fraction. In conclusion, this study found that treatment with ESPs exerts beneficial effects against CHF and is not associated with a higher mortality rate or adverse effects. These outcomes support the instigation of a trial evaluating the treatment of anemia with ESPs in patients with chronic CHF.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the effects of hydrocloric fasudil on acute focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion(IR) injury in rats.Methods Male SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: group S(sham operation group,n=24),group IR(ischemia/reperfusion,n=24),group F(Fasudil treated group,n=24).In each group the rats were treated with 10 min ischemia and 3,12,24h cerebral reperfusion,respectively with 8 rats in each subgroup.The model of focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury was established by using Pulsinelli's method.Immunohistochemical SP method was performed to examine the release of cytochrome C(cytC)at different time points after reperfusion;The pathological changes of nerve cells and mitochondria ultrastructure at hippocampus CA1 region were observed at 24h after reperfusion by light microscope and electron microscope.Results The activation of cytC began to increase at 3h after reperfusion,reached to the peak at 12h and then gradually decreased.Compared with group S,the cytC levels in group IR and F were increased significantly(P<0.01).The pathological changes of nerve cells and mitochondria ultrastructure in hippocampus CA1 region were exacerbated at 24h after reperfusion.Compared with IR group,the cytC levels in group P were decreased significantly(P<0.05 or P<0.01).The pathological changes of nerve cells and mitochondria ultrastructure in hippocampus CA1 region were improved at 24h after reperfusion.Conclusion Hydrocloric Fasudil intervenes in mitochondria-mediated and CytC-dependent apoptosis pathway.Hydrocloric Fasudil attenuates apoptosis,and protects nerve cells by maintaining mitochondrial basic form,stabilizing mitochondrial membrane and inhibiting the release of cytC.",

In this work, we focus on evaluating delta debugging in practical settings from developers' perspectives. A collection of real regressions taken from medium-sized open source programs is used in our evaluation. Towards automated debugging in software evolution, a tool based on delta debugging is created and both the limitations and costs are discussed. We have evaluated two variants of delta debugging. Different from successful isolation in Zeller's initial studies, the results in our experiments vary wildly. Two thirds of isolated changes in studied programs provide direct or indirect clues in locating regression bugs. The remaining results are superfluous changes or even wrong isolations. In the case of wrong isolations, the isolated changes cause the same behaviour of the regression but are failure-irrelevant. Moreover, the hierarchical variant does not yield definite improvements in terms of the efficiency and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Spectra-based fault localization (SFL) techniques have brought encouraging results and a variety of program spectra have been proposed to locate faults. Different types of abnormal behaviors may be revealed by different kinds of spectra. Compared to techniques using single spectra type, techniques combining multiple types of spectra try to leverage the strengths of the constituent types. However, in the presence of multiple kinds of spectra, how to select adequate spectra type and build appropriate models need further investigation. In this paper, we propose an SFL technique LOUPE, which uses multiple spectra-specific models. Both control and data dependences are introduced to capture unusual behaviors of faults. In the stage of suspiciousness modeling, in contrast with previous studies, we build different models to evaluate the suspiciousness of statements for each spectra type respectively. Finally, since the fault type is unknown in advance, suspiciousness scores are calculated based on the two models. We evaluate LOUPE on the Siemens benchmark and experimental results show that our technique is promising.",

        "abstract": "During software evolution, new released versions still contain many bugs. One common scenario is that end users encounter regression faults and submit them to bug tracking systems. Different from in-house regression testing, typically only one test input is available, which passes the old version and fails the modified new version. To address the issue, delta debugging has been proposed for failure-inducing changes identification between two versions. Despite promising results, there are two practical factors that thwart the application of delta debugging: a large number of tests and misleading false positives. In this work, we present a combination of coverage analysis and delta debugging that automatically isolates failure-inducing changes. Evaluations on twelve real regression faults in GNU software demonstrate both the speed gain and effectiveness improvements. Moreover, a case study on libPNG and TCPflow indicates that our technique is comparable to peer techniques in debugging regressions faults.",

        "abstract": "Most object detectors contain two important components: a feature extractor and an object classifier. The feature extractor has rapidly evolved with significant research efforts leading to better deep convolutional architectures. The object classifier, however, has not received much attention and many recent systems (like SPPnet and Fast/Faster R-CNN) use simple multi-layer perceptrons. This paper demonstrates that carefully designing deep networks for object classification is just as important. We experiment with region-wise classifier networks that use shared, region-independent convolutional features. We call them \"Networks on Convolutional feature maps\" (NoCs). We discover that aside from deep feature maps, a deep and convolutional per-region classifier is of particular importance for object detection, whereas latest superior image classification models (such as ResNets and GoogLeNets) do not directly lead to good detection accuracy without using such a per-region classifier. We show by experiments that despite the effective ResNets and Faster R-CNN systems, the design of NoCs is an essential element for the 1st-place winning entries in ImageNet and MS COCO challenges 2015.",

In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66% [33]).

Faster R-CNN involves two fully connected layers for RoI recognition, while R-FCN produces a large score maps. Thus, the speed of these networks is slow due to the heavy-head design in the architecture. Even if we significantly reduce the base model, the computation cost cannot be largely decreased accordingly. We propose a new two-stage detector, Light-Head R-CNN, to address the shortcoming in current two-stage approaches. In our design, we make the head of network as light as possible, by using a thin feature map and a cheap R-CNN subnet (pooling and single fully-connected layer). Our ResNet-101 based light-head R-CNN outperforms state-of-art object detectors on COCO while keeping time efficiency. More importantly, simply replacing the backbone with a tiny network (e.g, Xception), our Light-Head R-CNN gets 30.7 mmAP at 102 FPS on COCO, significantly outperforming the single-stage, fast detectors like YOLO and SSD on both speed and accuracy.

In this work, we showed that a tunable red-to-green emission ratio can be achieved by rationally designing the depopulation mechanism of intermediate state via increasing pump power density, pulse duration, pulse interval and Yb 3+  concentration accompanied with the waveguide effect in a single Yb 3+ /Er 3+  codoped NaYF 4  microtube. We revealed that the red UC luminescence can be enhanced by three-photon process. As expected, three-photon and two-photon processes could be effectively switched by controlling pulse duration and power density. Compared with varying the power density, elevating the Yb concentration accompanied with the waveguide effect is more effective in modifying the color output. Our results provide insight into underlying physical mechanisms of intervening electronic population and present a general approach to constructing a new class of luminescent materials with tunable UC emissions.",

        "abstract": "Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a fixed-size (e.g., 224224) input image. This requirement is \u201cartificial\u201d and may reduce the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, \u201cspatial pyramid pooling\u201d, to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all CNN-based image classification methods. On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs. On the Pascal VOC 2007 and Caltech101 datasets, SPP-net achieves state-of-theart classification results using a single full-image representation and no fine-tuning. The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method is 24-102 faster than the R-CNN method, while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. In ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, our methods rank #2 in object detection and #3 in image classification among all 38 teams. This manuscript also introduces the improvement made for this competition.",

Although it is publicly known that there is a gap between the task of image classification and object detection, designing a suitable detector backbone is still manually exhaustive. In this paper, we propose DetNAS to automatically search neural architectures for the backbones of object detectors. In DetNAS, the search space is formulated into a supernet and the search method relies on evolution algorithm (EA). In experiments, we show the effectiveness of DetNAS on various detectors, the one-stage detector, RetinaNet, and the two-stage detector, FPN. For each case, we search in both training from scratch scheme and ImageNet pre-training scheme. There is a consistent superiority compared to the architectures searched on ImageNet classification. Our main result architecture achieves better performance than ResNet-101 on COCO with the FPN detector. In addition, we illustrate the architectures searched by DetNAS and find some meaningful patterns.",

Our central idea is to construct a simplified supernet, Single Path Supernet, which is trained by an uniform path sampling method. All underlying architectures (and their weights) get trained fully and equally. Once we have a trained supernet, we apply an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently search the best-performing architectures without any fine tuning. Comprehensive experiments verify that our approach is flexible and effective. It is easy to train and fast to search. It effortlessly supports complex search spaces (e.g., building blocks, channel, mixed-precision quantization) and different search constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency). It is thus convenient to use for various needs. It achieves start-of-the-art performance on the large dataset ImageNet.",

        "abstract": "Recent research on super-resolution has achieved great success due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). However, super-resolution of arbitrary scale factor has been ignored for a long time. Most previous researchers regard super-resolution of different scale factors as independent tasks. They train a specific model for each scale factor which is inefficient in computing, and prior work only take the super-resolution of several integer scale factors into consideration. In this work, we propose a novel method called Meta-SR to firstly solve super-resolution of arbitrary scale factor (including non-integer scale factors) with a single model. In our Meta-SR, the Meta-Upscale Module is proposed to replace the traditional upscale module. For arbitrary scale factor, the Meta-Upscale Module dynamically predicts the weights of the upscale filters by taking the scale factor as input and use these weights to generate the HR image of arbitrary size. For any low-resolution image, our Meta-SR can continuously zoom in it with arbitrary scale factor by only using a single model. We evaluated the proposed method through extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets on single image super-resolution. The experimental results show the superiority of our Meta-Upscale.",

However, in the field of semantic segmentation, where we need to perform dense per-pixel prediction, we find that the large kernel (and effective receptive field) plays an important role when we have to perform the classification and localization tasks simultaneously. Following our design principle, we propose a Global Convolutional Network to address both the classification and localization issues for the semantic segmentation. We also suggest a residual-based boundary refinement to further refine the object boundaries. Our approach achieves state-of-art performance on two public benchmarks and significantly outperforms previous results, 82.2% (vs 80.2%) on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and 76.9% (vs 71.8%) on Cityscapes dataset.",

        "abstract": "The development of object detection in the era of deep learning, from R-CNN [11], Fast/Faster R-CNN [10, 31] to recent Mask R-CNN [14] and RetinaNet [24], mainly come from novel network, new framework, or loss design. However, mini-batch size, a key factor for the training of deep neural networks, has not been well studied for object detection. In this paper, we propose a Large Mini-Batch Object Detector (MegDet) to enable the training with a large minibatch size up to 256, so that we can effectively utilize at most 128 GPUs to significantly shorten the training time. Technically, we suggest a warmup learning rate policy and Cross-GPU Batch Normalization, which together allow us to successfully train a large mini-batch detector in much less time (e.g., from 33 hours to 4 hours), and achieve even better accuracy. The MegDet is the backbone of our submission (mmAP 52.5%) to COCO 2017 Challenge, where we won the 1st place of Detection task.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   3D C f /ZrC\u2013SiC composites were prepared by a combination process of slurry infiltration and reactive melt infiltration. ZrO 2  powders and ZrSi 2  alloy, both of which reacted with amorphous carbon, were used as pore-making agent and infiltrator, respectively. After carbothermal reduction at 1650\u00a0\u00b0C, X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that ZrO 2  powders were completely converted into ZrC by reacting with amorphous carbon, and an in-situ formed submicron porous configuration was observed at the areas containing ZrO 2 . Results showed that the matrix in composites mainly consisted of SiC, ZrC and a small quantity of residual metal. SEM and TEM images revealed the formation of ZrC or SiC intergranular particles in the matrix and the characteristic around the residual resin carbon. The composites had a bending strength of 94.89\u00b116.7\u00a0MPa, fracture toughness of 11.0\u00b10.98\u00a0MPa\u00a0m 1/2 , bulk density of 3.36\u00b10.01\u00a0g/cm 3 , and open porosity of 4.64\u00b10.40%. The formation mechanisms of ZrC\u2013SiC dual matrix and intrabundles\u05f3 structure were discussed in the article.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Reaction bonded B 4 C-SiC composites were prepared by infiltrating silicon melt into porous B 4 C-SiC green preforms at 1500\u00a0\u00b0C in vacuum. The porous green preform was obtained from a mixture of polycarbosilane (PCS) and particle size graded B 4 C after pre-sintering at 1600\u00a0\u00b0C. For the first time, PCS was used to adjust the phase composition and microstructure of the reaction bonded boron carbide composites. It is indicated that the addition of PCS and its content has a significant influence on the microstructure as well as the mechanical properties of the subsequent reaction bonded B 4 C-SiC composites. For the B 4 C-SiC composite with 5\u00a0wt% PCS added, a flexural strength of 319\u00b112\u00a0MPa, and an elastic modulus of 402\u00b118\u00a0GPa can be achieved, which is 23% and 15% higher than those of the composite without PCS addition, respectively. While, with the higher content of PCS addition, the mechanical properties of the composites are decreased drastically due to the large amount of residual Si agglomeration in the composites. The reaction mechanisms as well as their microstructure evolution processes correlated with the mechanical properties of the reaction bonded B 4 C-SiC composites are further discussed in our work.",

Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was used to combine the reactants to form a suitable precursor for ZrC.

The formed precursor can be converted to ZrC by carbothermal reduction reaction at 1600\u20131650 \u00b0C. Thanks to a limited amount of residual free carbon, the as-synthesized ZrC powder had an ultra-fine particle size (50\u2013100 nm) and a low oxygen content less than 1.0 wt%. The conversion mechanisms from as-synthesized pre-ceramic precursor to ZrC powder were investigated systematically and revealed by means of FTIR, TG-DSC, XRD, Raman, SEM and TEM.",

Results showed that Al 2 O 3  was enriched in the oxidized layer, and impeded the crystallization of oxide (cristobalite) during cooling. Denser oxidized layer and less weigh change were observed. Infrared spectra indicated that the addition of Al 2 O 3  could weaken the tendency of bridged oxygen atoms (Si-O-Si, Si-O-Al) to become non-bridged oxygen atoms (Si-O-H) and enhance the degree of interconnection of the structural units. The above phenomenon was attributed to the fact that the bridging oxygen bond between Al and Si was not broken but protonated. The protonated bridging oxygen (Al-O(H)-Si) still acts as a linkage in the glass network, which results in higher viscosity of the aluminosilicates melt and lower reaction activity with steam, thereby significantly improving the oxidation resistance of Si-B-C in O 2 /H 2 O atmosphere.",

A novel strategy to prepare printable graphene ink is reported first, and three-dimensional scaffolds with high content (50\u202fwt %) and aligned graphene are achieved by three-dimensional printing. Adequate shear thinning and rheology behavior are required for printable graphene ink to flow through the nozzle smoothly and self-support during the printing process. The scaffolds with different contents and printing parameters exhibit good resolution and good bonding between layers. The alignment of graphene sheets along the direction of flowing can be observed due to the shear stress in the nozzle. When the temperature rises up to 450\u202f\u00b0C, electrical conductivities along transvers and longitudinal directions of 50\u202fwt % are enhanced to 479.2 and 425.6\u202fS/m, which are 6.7 and 8.4 times higher than that at room temperature, respectively. The alignment can contribute to the electrical anisotropy of three-dimensional graphene scaffolds. The electrical resistance variations under compression and electrical anisotropy demonstrate the potential application of the graphene scaffolds in electrical device, sensor, especially combined with three-dimensional printing.",

        "abstract": "Layer-structured interphase, existing between carbon fiber and ultrahigh-temperature ceramics (UHTCs) matrix, is an indispensable component for carbon fiber reinforced UHTCs matrix composites (Cf/UHTCs). For Cf/UHTCs fabricated by reactive melt infiltration (RMI), the interphase inevitably suffers degradation due to the interaction with the reactive melt. Here, Cf/SiC\u2013ZrC\u2013ZrB2 composite was fabricated by reactive infiltration of ZrSi2 melt into sol-gel prepared Cf/B4C\u2013C preform. (PyC\u2013SiC)2 interphase was deposited on the fiber to investigate the degradation mechanism under ZrSi2 melt. It was revealed that the degraded interphase exhibited typical features of Zr aggregation and SiC residuals. Moreover, the Zr species diffused across the interphase and formed nanosized ZrC phase inside the fiber. A hybrid mechanisms of chemical reaction and physical melting were proposed to reveal the degradation mechanism according to characterization results and heat conduction calculations. Based on the degradation mechanism, a potential solution to mitigate interphase degradation is also put forward.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A graphene-based elastomer for sensors with tunable and high sensitivity was fabricated by using three-dimensional printing, in which a printable ink was developed by homogenizing graphene and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). To make the elastomer tunable and highly sensitive, different microstructures of three-dimensional graphene-PDMS (3DGP) can be formed. Attributed to its well-interconnected scaffolds and designed microstructures, 3DGP demonstrates a series of multifunctional properties, such as excellent stability and a large gauge factor (up to 448\u202fat 30% strain). 3DGP has continuously stable piezoresistive behavior, even after 100 compress-release cycles under 10% strain. By considering the essential properties of 3DGP scaffolds, such as filament diameter, interaxial angle and interlayer space, the printed 3DGP structure can be tunable and highly sensitive. The controllable design and scalable fabrication of the 3DGP advanced functional material suggests that tunable strain sensors and wearable devices have great potential for different applications, which is a finding that can be referenced by future studies on 3D graphene-based sensors.",

Blood compatibility assays and complement activation tests revealed that FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles did not induce blood hemolysis, blood clotting, or complement activation. The results also indicated that FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles had no biotoxic effects, the drug delivery system allowed controlled release of the cargo molecules, and the co-delivery of cisplatin and paclitaxel efficiently induces cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle retardation. In addition, co-delivery of cisplatin and paclitaxel showed the ability to suppress xenograft lung cancer growth and prolong the survival time of xenografted mice. These results implied that FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles can function as effective carriers of cisplatin and paclitaxel, and that co-delivery of cisplatin and paclitaxel by FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles results in more effective antitumor effects than the combination of free-drugs or single-drug-loaded nanoparticles.",

In this work, mPEG-PE (polyethylene glycol-L-\u03b1-phosphatidylethanolamine) was synthesized and used to prepare nanoparticles composed of mPEG-PE and calcium phosphate for siRNA delivery. Calcium phosphate and mPEG-PE formed the stable hybrid nanoparticles through self-assembly resulting from electrostatic interaction in water. The average size of the hybrid nanoparticles was approximately 53.2 nm with a negative charge of approximately -16.7 mV, which was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. The nanoparticles exhibited excellent stability in serum and could protect siRNA from ribonuclease (RNase) degradation. The cellular internalization of siRNA-loaded nanoparticles was evaluated in SMMC-7721 cells using a laser scanning confocal microscope (CLSM) and flow cytometry. The hybrid nanoparticles could efficiently deliver siRNA to cells compared with free siRNA. Moreover, the in vivo distribution of Cy5-siRNA-loaded hybrid nanoparticles was observed after being injected into tumor-bearing nude mice. The nanoparticles concentrated in the tumor regions through an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect based on the fluorescence intensities of tissue distribution. A safety evaluation of the nanoparticles was performed both in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that the hybrid nanoparticle delivery system had almost no toxicity. These results indicated that the mPEG-PE/CaP hybrid nanoparticles could be a stable, safe and promising siRNA nanocarrier for anticancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "An amphiphilic copolymer, folic acid (FA) modified poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (FA-PEG-PLGA) was prepared and explored as a nanometer carrier for the co-delivery of cisplatin (cis-diaminodichloroplatinum, CDDP) and paclitaxel (PTX). CDDP and PTX were encapsulated inside the hydrophobic inner core and chelated to the middle shell, respectively. PEG provided the outer corona for prolonged circulation. An in vitro release profile of the CDDP + PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles revealed that the PTX chelation cross-link prevented an initial burst release of CDDP. After an incubation period of 24 hours, the CDDP+PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles exhibited a highly synergistic effect for the inhibition of A549 (FA receptor negative) and M109 (FA receptor positive) lung cancer cell line proliferation. Pharmacokinetic experiment and distribution research shows that nanoparticles have longer circulation time in the blood and can prolong the treatment times of chemotherapeutic drugs. For the in vivo treatment of A549 cells xeno-graft lung tumor, the CDDP+PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles displayed an obvious tumor inhibiting effect with an 89.96% tumor suppression rate (TSR). This TSR was significantly higher than that of free chemotherapy drug combination or nanoparticles with a single drug. For M109 cells xeno-graft tumor, the TSR was 95.03%. In vitro and in vivo experiments have all shown that the CDDP+PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles have better targeting and antitumor effects in M109 cells than CDDP+PTX-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (p < 0.05). In addition, more importantly, the enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of the CDDP+PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles came with reduced side-effects. No obvious body weight loss or functional changes occurred within blood components, liver, or kidneys during the treatment of A549 and M109 tumor-bearing mice with the CDDP+PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles. Thus, the FA modified amphiphilic copolymer-based combination of CDDP and PTX may provide useful guidance for effective and safe cancer chemotherapy, especially in tumors with high FA receptor expression.",

        "abstract": "Nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely used as carriers to deliver siRNA and chemotherapeutic agents. Bcl-2 siRNA has been widely used to induce cancer cell apoptosis, and doxorubicin (Dox) can destroy cancer cells by binding with cancer cell DNA.To investigate the therapeutic effect on lung cancer of simultaneously delivering Dox and Bcl-2-siRNA using epidermal growth factor (EGF) modified monomethoxy (polyethylene glycol)-poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide)-poly(L-lysine) (mPEG-PLGA-PLL, PEAL) NPs (EGF-PEAL).EGF-PEAL NPs were characterized with respect to size, zeta potential and morphology. Cytotoxicity and drug (or siRNA) loading capacity of EGF-PEAL NPs were analyzed. Cellular uptake, drug release profile, cell killing effects of Dox and Bcl-2-siRNA-loaded EGF-PEAL NPs were assessed. Biodistribution and therapeutic effects of Dox and Bcl-2-siRNA EGF-PEAL NPs were evaluated in H1299 tumor-bearing mice.EGF-PEAL NPs or PEAL NPs had nearly negligible cytotoxicity toward H1299 cells. Dox and Bcl-2-siRNA gradually released from EGF-PEAL NPs and exhibited sustained release patterns. Dox and Bcl-2-siRNA-loaded NPs were taken up by cells and induced the apoptosis of H1299 cells more effectively than using Dox or Bcl-2 siRNA alone. With the intravenous injection of PEAL NPs into H1299 xenografted mice, we found that combination treatment suppressed lung cancer growth and reduced Bcl-2 expression in tumor tissue, and EGF-PEAL NPs concentrated in lung tumor much more than non-targeted PEAL NPs.We conclude that co-delivery of Dox and Bcl-2-siRNA by tumor-targeted EGF-PEAL NPs could significantly inhibit lung cancer growth.",

        "abstract": " Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) accounts for the majority of prostate cancer deaths, and patients with CRPC are prone to developing drug resistance. Therefore, there is a need to develop effective therapeutics to treat CRPC, especially drug-resistant CRPC. Although various nanoparticles have been developed for drug or gene delivery and control release, approaches to reproducibly formulate the optimal treatment with nanoparticles that could effectively target CRPC and bone metastasis remain suboptimal. Recently, codelivery of a chemotherapeutic agent and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) has become a promising strategy for the treatment of drug-resistant prostate cancer.  In a previous study, we prepared a novel RGD-PEG-DSPE/CaP nanoparticle as an effective and biocompatible drug and gene delivery system. In this study, we further modify the nanoparticle to obtain the LCP-RGD nanoparticle, which contains a calcium phosphate (CaP) core, dioleoyl phosphatidic acid (DOPA) and RGD modified poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (RGD-PEG-DSPE). This drug delivery system was used for codelivery of GRP78 siRNA and docetaxel (DTXL) for the treatment of the PC-3 CRPC.  The nanoparticles contain the CaP core, which can effectively compress the negatively charged siRNA, while the DOPA and RGD-PEG-DSPE component can effectively carry DTXL. The arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) segment can target the prostate cancer site, as the cancer site is neovascularized. This novel nanoparticle has good stability, excellent biocompatibility, high drug and siRNA loading capacity, and an in vitro sustainable release profile.  Codelivery of DTXL and GRP78 siRNA has enhanced in vitro and in vivo anti-prostate cancer effects which are much greater than using free DTXL and free GRP78 siRNA together. Our study also indicated that codelivery of DTXL and GRP78 siRNA have an in vitro and in vivo combinational anti-prostate cancer effect and also could effectively sensitize the cell-killing effect of DTXL; this method may be especially suitable for drug-resistant CRPC treatment.",

Polyethylene glycol-poly-L-lysine/RGD-PD/phospholipid/calcium phosphate nanoparticles (PEG-PLL/RGD-PD/PL/CaP NPs or MNPs) were prepared using a novel, simple method conducted at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the MNPs were spheres of uniform size, with a diameter of \u223c30 nm, and smooth surface. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the PEG-PLL/RGD-PD/PL micelle was packed in the CaP shell. MNPs had little effect on hemolysis, coagulation, cardiac oxidative stress, inflammatory response and DNA damage, indicating negligible cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Experiments in Zebrafish indicated that the MNPs neither affected the survival rate and heartbeat rate, nor induced malformation and apoptosis during embryogenesis. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the newly-developed MNPs have good biocompatibility and a great potential as drug and gene carrier.",

        "abstract": "Triptolide has proven to possess anticancer potential and been widely used for anti-cancer research. However, the liver and kidney toxicity has limited its application in cancer treatment. In this study, a drug delivery system based on mPEG-DPPE/calcium phosphate was developed to co-load triptolide and curcumin (TP and Curc-NPs). The coefficient of drug interaction (CDI) was calculated to determine the optimal concentration of the two drugs. When the concentration of triptolide was 25.22 ng/mL and the concentration of curcumin was 6.62 \u03bcg/mL, the two drugs reached the maximum synergistic killing effects on SKOV-3 tumor cells. The TP and Curc-NPs was prepared using ultrasonic emulsification. Flow cytometry results revealed that the TP and Curc-NPs arrested cell-cycle in the S and G2/M phases and exhibited a strong ability to induce apoptosis. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) results indicated that curcumin could reduce the intracellular ROS level caused by triptolide. The mRNA levels of heat shock protein (HSP) were detected by qTR-PCR and the results showed that the TP and Curc-NPs could lower the HSP70 mRNA level while could not reduce the HSP90 mRNA level. The animal experiments demonstrated the favorable curative effects of the TP and Curc-NPs, and the tumor inhibition rate reached 68.78%. The results of the pathological examinations demonstrated that the nanoparticles had no significant toxic effects on important organs. In conclusion, the TP and Curc-NPs exerted synergistic effects on ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo, and the toxicity caused by triptolide may be reduced by curcumin through anti-oxidative stress effects. The TP and Curc-NPs could be a promising strategy for ovarian cancer.",

As demonstrated, the system has remarkable performance on controlling drug release, blocking TRPV6 cation channel, enhancing cell cycle arrest, elevating temperature and generating ROS, thus improving cellular toxicity along with apoptosis, enhancing tumor targeting, and achieving the therapy to ARPC with low toxicity on liver function and minimal side effects to normal organs. Notably, both PTT and PDT effect are generated under single irradiation situation because of the broad absorbance window, along with limited skin damages. As a specific synergistic platform creatively integrating multiple treatment protocols with negative toxicity, PTX-PP@Au NPs provide a facile, effective, and broadly applicable strategy to deadly ARPC.",

        "abstract": "In a previous study, amphiphilic copolymer, polypeptide K237 (HTMYYHHYQHHL) and folic acid (FA) modified poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (K237/FA-PEG-PLGA) nanoparticles were developed and studied as a drug carrier. To further promote the clinical application of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles and provide guidance for future research, we need to examine their specific biodistribution in vivo. In this study, K237/FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles were effectively labeled by a direct method with Technetium-99m (99mTc) using stannous chloride as a reducing agent. The optimal stability of the labeled nanoparticles was determined by evaluating their radiochemical purity in serum, physiological saline, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and cysteine solutions. The affinity of ligands and receptors was elicited by cell binding and blocking experiments in KDR/folate receptor high expressing SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. The nanoparticles biodistribution was studied after intravenous administration in healthy mice xenografted with SKOV-3 cells. A higher percent injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) was observed in liver, kidney, spleen, blood and tumor at 3 and 9 h post-injection. Scintigraphic images revealed that the radioactivity was mainly concentrated in tumor, liver, kidney and bladder; and in the heart, lung, and muscle was significantly lower at 3 h. The radioactivity distribution in the images is consistent with the in vivo biodistribution data. Our works demonstrated that K237/FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles have great potential as biodegradable drug carriers, especially for tumors expressing the folate and KDr receptor.",

Blood-vessel-embolic agents were essential in transarterial embolization (TAE). In this work, thermo-sensitive composite hydrogels based on poloxamer 407, sodium alginate, hydroxymethyl cellulose and iodixanol (PSHI), together with Ca2+ (PSHI-Ca2+) were prepared as liquid embolic agents for TAE therapy to liver cancer. With increasing temperature, PSHI exhibited two phase states: a flowing sol and a shrunken gel. Rheology tests showed good fluidity and excellent viscoelastic behavior with a gelation temperature (GT) of 26.5\u00b0C. The studies of erosion indicated that PSHI had calcium ion-related erosion characteristics and showed a slow erosion rate in an aqueous environment. When incubated with L929 cells, the thermo-sensitive composite hydrogels had low cytotoxicity in vitro. The results of analyzing the digital subtraction angiography and computed tomography images obtained from in vitro and in vivo assays indicated a good embolic effect in the renal arteries of normal rabbits. Angiography and histological studies on VX2 tumor-bearing rabbits indicated that PSHI-Ca2+ successfully occluded the tumors, including the peripheral vessels. In conclusion, PSHI-Ca2+ was a promising embolic agent for transarterial embolization therapy.",

We developed a polyethylene glycol-dipalmitoylphosphatidyle- thanoiamine (mPEG-DPPE) calcium phosphate nanoparticles (NPs) injectable thermoresponsive hydrogel (nanocomposite gel) that could provide a sustained and local delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and temozolomide (TMZ). In addition, the proportion of PTX and TMZ for the optimal synergistic antiglioma effect on C6 cells was determined to be 1:100 (w/w) by the Chou and Talalay method. Our results clearly indicated that the autophagy induced by PTX:TMZ NPs plays an important role in regulating tumor cell death, while autophagy inhibition dramatically reverses the antitumor effect of PTX:TMZ NPs, suggesting that antiproliferative autophagy occurs in response to PTX:TMZ NPs treatment. The antitumor efficacy of the PTX:TMZ NP-loaded gel was evaluated in situ using C6 tumor-bearing rats, and the PTX:TMZ NP-loaded gel exhibited superior antitumor performance. The antitumor effects of the nanocomposite gel in vivo were shown to correlate with autophagic cell death in this study. The in vivo results further confirmed the advantages of such a strategy. The present study may provide evidence supporting the development of nanomedicine for potential clinical application.",

As an alternative to conventional single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) solutions with massive parallelism for self-organizing-map (SOM) neural network models, we report resource-efficient hardware architecture for 1-chip implementation of the learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network algorithm, which is a variant of SOM. Dynamic configurability for two operation modes is realized through the same circuitry for recognition based on nearest-neighbor matching and on-chip learning based on error back-propagation. Switching between learning and recognition modes is carried out by a pipeline with multiplexers and parallel p-word input (P-MPPI). The multiplexers enable data-flow-path reconfiguration, resulting in a significant reduction of area and power consumption. Thus, the P-MPPI architecture achieves time-domain multiplexing between operation modes as well as area/energy-efficiency by reusing both memory arrays and arithmetic or logic units. Additionally, high flexibility for feature-vector dimension and reference-vector number allows the implementation of many different applications, including continuously adaptive neural systems, on the same hardware platform. A test chip in TSMC 65 nm CMOS has parallel 32-word inputs, 585 K-bit on-chip memory, and achieves high processing throughput of 76.8 Gbps and low power consumption of 27.92 mW (at 150 MHz, 1.0 V supply voltage).",

        "abstract": "The Hough Transform (HT) is a method for extracting straight lines from an edge image. The main limitations of the HT for usage in actual applications are computation time and storage requirements. This paper reports a hardware architecture for HT implementation on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with parallelized voting procedure. The 2-dimensional accumulator array, namely the Hough space in parametric form (\u03c1, \u03b8), for computing the strength of each line by a voting mechanism is mapped on a 1-dimensional array with regular increments of \u03b8. Then, this Hough space is divided into a number of parallel parts. The computation of (\u03c1, \u03b8) for the edge pixels and the voting procedure for straight-line determination are therefore executable in parallel. In addition, a synchronized initialization for the Hough space further increases the speed of straight-line detection, so that XGA video processing becomes possible. The designed prototype system has been synthesized on a DE4 platform with a Stratix-IV FPGA device. In the application of road-lane detection, the average processing speed of this HT implementation is 5.4ms per XGA-frame at 200 MHz working frequency.",

To improve the resource efficiency, we propose a hardware-efficient image compression circuit based on the vector quantization for a high-speed image sensor. In this circuit, a self-organizing map is implemented for the on-chip learning of codebook to flexibly satisfy the requirements of different applications. To reduce the hardware resources, we present a reconfigurable complete-binary-adder-tree, where the arithmetic units are reused completely. In addition, a mechanism of partial vector-component storage is adapted to make the compression ratio adjustable. Finally, a parallel-elementary-stream design ensures a high processing speed. The proposed circuit has been implemented on the field-programmable gate araray and also applied in a high-speed object tracking system. The experimental results indicate that it achieves an encoding speed of 722 frames/s with 128 weight vectors when working at 79.8 MHz, and the worst tracking error caused by the proposed circuit is merely 9 pixels. These results evince that our proposed circuit can be completely integrated with a high-speed image sensor and used in high-speed vision systems.",

        "abstract": "As an alternative to conventional single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) mode solutions with massive parallelism for self-organizing-map (SOM) neural network models, this paper reports a memory-based proposal for the learning vector quantization (LVQ), which is a variant of SOM. A dual-mode LVQ system, enabling both on-chip learning and classification, is implemented by using a reconfigurable pipeline with parallel p-word input (R-PPPI) architecture. As a consequence of the reuse of R-PPPI for solving the most severe computational demands in both modes, power dissipation and Si-area consumption can be dramatically reduced in comparison to previous LVQ implementations. In addition, the designed LVQ ASIC has high flexibility with respect to feature-vector dimensionality and reference-vector number, allowing the execution of many different machine-learning applications. The fabricated test chip in 180 nm CMOS with parallel 8-word inputs and 102 K-bit on-chip memory achieves low power consumption of 66.38 mW (at 75 MHz and 1.8 V) and high learning speed of clock cycles per d-dimensional sample vector where R is the reference-vector number.",

We report a hardware implementation of the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) algorithm for real-time object recognition, which is known to provide high efficiency and accuracy. The developed hardware-oriented algorithm exploits the cell-based scan strategy which enables image-sensor synchronization and extraction-speed acceleration. Furthermore, buffers for image frames or integral images are avoided. An image-size scalable hardware architecture with an effective bin-decoder and a parallelized voting element (PVE) is developed and used to verify the hardware-oriented HOG implementation with the application of human detection.

One 180 nm CMOS prototype can extract the 1680-dimensional Haar-like feature vectors, applied in the speeded up robust features (SURF) scheme, using an on-chip memory of only 96 kb (kilobit). Additionally, a low power dissipation of only 43.45 mW at 1.8 V supply voltage is achieved during VGA video procession at 120 MHz frequency with more than 325 fps. The Haar-like feature-extraction coprocessor is further evaluated by the practical application of vehicle recognition, achieving the expected high accuracy which is comparable to previous work.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a compact vector quantizer based on the self-organizing map (SOM), which can fulfill the data compression task for high-speed image sequence. In this vector quantizer, we solve the most severe computational demands in the codebook learning mode and the image encoding mode by a reconfigurable complete-binary-adder-tree (RCBAT), where the arithmetic units are thoroughly reused. In this way, the hardware efficiency of our proposed vector quantizer is greatly improved. In addition, by distributing the codebook into the multi-parallel processing sub-blocks, our design obtains a high compression speed successfully. Furthermore, a mechanism of partial vector-component storage (PVCS) is adopted to make the compression ratio adjustable. Finally, the proposed vector quantizer has been implemented on the field programmable gate array (FPGA). The experimental results indicate that it respectively achieves a compression speed of 500 frames/s and a million connections per second (MCPS) of 28,494 (compression ratio is 64) when working at 79.8 MHz. Besides, compared with the previous scheme, our proposed quantizer achieves a reduction of 8% in hardware usage and an increase of 33% in compression speed. This means the proposed quantizer is hardware-efficient and can be used for high-speed image compression.",

The conventional single instruction multiple data (SIMD) solution sufficiently exploits the massive intrinsic parallelism of artificial neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a parallel-elementary-stream (PES) architecture for nearest-neighbor-search (NNS) based SOM model as an alternative to SIMD. The PES defines p parallel units each of which can process one element per clock. Meanwhile, every d-dimensional neuron vector (NV) as well as the input vector is partially stored in p dual-port memory blocks. In particular, each memory block stores \u2308d/p\u2309 vector-components each of which is defined as an element. The distance between n NVs and one input vector for NNS can be sequentially calculated in n\u00d7\u2308d/p\u2309+\u03b1 clock cycles where \u03b1 is the pipeline delay. Furthermore, the processing unit for NNS is reconfigured to update the winner neurons. The experimental results show that the NNS performance is 3 times higher than the SIMD solution with the same working frequency and process technology but the core area is 4.3 times smaller than that of the SIMD solution.",

One way in which damaged components such as mitochondria, protein aggregates, or peroxisomes are degraded is through autophagy, a process in which a double-membrane vesicle encapsulates cargo and delivers it to the acidic lysosome for degradation. A diverse array of molecular mechanisms target the autophagic machinery specifically to damaged cargo and spare healthy components in a process called selective autophagy. Disruption of these processes leads to accumulation of unhealthy organelles, oxidative stress, inflammation, and disease progression. Conversely, stimulating the autophagy-lysosomal degradation system in disease states featuring overt accumulation of dysfunctional organelles provides an attractive avenue for therapies. In this Review, which contains 6 figures, 1 table, and 252 citations, we focus on emerging evidence and key questions about the role of selective autophagy in the cell biology and pathophysiology of cardiometabolic diseases.",

        "abstract": "In the atherosclerotic plaque, macrophages are the key catabolic workhorse responsible for clearing lipid and dead cell debris. To survive the highly proinflammatory and lipotoxic plaque environment, macrophages must adopt strategies for maintaining tight homeostasis and self-renewal. Macroautophagy/autophagy is a pro-survival cellular pathway wherein damaged or excess cellular cargoes are encapsulated by a double-membrane compartment and delivered to the lysosome for hydrolysis. Previously, macrophage-specific autophagy deficiency has been shown to be atherogenic through several complementary mechanisms including hyperactivation of the inflammasome, defective efferocytosis, accumulation of cytotoxic protein aggregates, and impaired lipid degradation. Conversely, in a recent study we hypothesized that enhancing the macrophage autophagy-lysosomal system through genetic or pharmacological means could protect against atherosclerosis. We demonstrated that TFEB, a transcription factor master regulator of autophagy and lysosome biogenesis, coordinately enhances the function of this system to reduce atherosclerotic plaque burden. Further, we characterized the disaccharide trehalose as a novel inducer of TFEB with similar atheroprotective effects. Overall, these findings mechanistically interrogate the importance and therapeutic promise of a functional autophagy-lysosome degradation system in plaque macrophage biology.",

        "abstract": "Peroxisomes perform essential functions in lipid metabolism, including fatty acid oxidation and plasmalogen synthesis. Here, we describe a role for peroxisomal lipid metabolism in mitochondrial dynamics in brown and beige adipocytes. Adipose tissue peroxisomal biogenesis was induced in response to cold exposure through activation of the thermogenic co-regulator PRDM16. Adipose-specific knockout of the peroxisomal biogenesis factor Pex16 (Pex16-AKO) in mice impaired cold tolerance, decreased energy expenditure, and increased diet-induced obesity. Pex16 deficiency blocked cold-induced mitochondrial fission, decreased mitochondrial copy number, and caused mitochondrial dysfunction. Adipose-specific knockout of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme acyl CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1-AKO) was not sufficient to affect adiposity, thermogenesis or mitochondrial copy number, but knockdown of the plasmalogen synthetic enzyme glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) recapitulated the effects of Pex16 inactivation on mitochondrial morphology and function. Plasmalogens are present in mitochondria and decreased with Pex16 inactivation. Their dietary supplementation increased mitochondrial copy number, improved mitochondrial function, and rescued thermogenesis in Pex16-AKO mice. These findings support a surprising interaction between peroxisomes and mitochondria to regulate mitochondrial dynamics and thermogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Nanoparticles have been widely used for preclinical cancer imaging. However, their successful clinical translation is largely hampered by potential toxicity, unsatisfactory detection of malignancy at early stages, inaccurate diagnosis of tumor biomarkers and histology for imaging-guided treatment. Herein, a targeted and in vivo degradable copper nanocluster (CuNC) is reported with high potential to address these challenges for future translation. Its ultrasmall structure enables efficient renal/bowel clearance, minimized off-target effects in non-targeted organs, and low non-specific tumor retention. The pH-dependent in vivo dissolution of CuNCs affords minimal toxicity and potentially selective drug delivery to tumors. The intrinsic radiolabeling through the direct addition of 64Cu into CuNC (64Cu-CuNCs) synthesis offers high specific activity for sensitive and accurate detection of CXCR4 in novel triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient-derived xenograft mouse models and human TNBC tissues. Taken together, this study not only demonstrates the potential of CXCR4 targeted 64Cu-CuNCs for TNBC imaging in clinical settings, but also provides a useful strategy to design and assess the translational potential of nanoparticles for cancer theranostics.",

Thus, there has been intense interest in the cardiovascular community to devise strategies to induce autophagy as an atheroprotective measure. We approached this by pharmacologically manipulating a critical upstream activator of autophagy, Beclin-1, a protein involved in the formation of the autophagy initiation complex and biogenesis of the autophagosome. A cell-permeable Beclin-1 peptide (known to induce autophagy both in vitro and in vivo) was administered to pro-atherogenic ApoE-null mice fed a Western diet for a period of 8 weeks. Despite its autophagy-inducing properties in vivo, Beclin-1 peptide failed to reduce the development of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptide\u2019s autophagy-inducing properties in vitro were also insufficient to blunt atherogenic lipid-induced hyperactivation of the inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 or stimulate the clearance of cytotoxic protein aggregates. These data lead us to conclude that the induction of autophagy is not sufficient to curb atherosclerotic progression. It is increasingly appreciated that macrophages of the atherosclerotic plaque also progressively develop a profound lysosomal dysfunction which likely precedes and exacerbates autophagy dysfunction. This raises that notion that combined stimulation of both autophagy and lysosomes would be necessary to ameliorate atherosclerosis and that efforts to stimulate autophagy in isolation are unlikely to be successful.",

        "abstract": "The autophagy-lysosome system is a catabolic cellular mechanism that degrades dysfunctional proteins and organelles. In atherosclerosis, there is mounting evidence that this process is rendered dysfunctional particularly in plaque macrophages and is an important trigger for plaque progression. In an effort to characterize practical inducers of macrophage degradative capacity, we now describe the unique vascular benefits of a natural sugar called trehalose, a recognized autophagy inducer with a currently unknown mechanism of action. Trehalose-treated macrophages display enhanced autophagy via a process that involves lysosomal stress and resultant activation of TFEB, the master transcriptional regulator of autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis. We find an important downstream effect of trehalose to be the induction of p62-dependent selective autophagy of cytotoxic polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and dampening of IL-1\u03b2/inflammasome function. We confirm the relevance of these in vitro observations in several pro-atherogenic (ApoE-/-) mouse models. Administration of trehalose during eight weeks of Western diet feeding potently induces autophagy and TFEB in plaque macrophages with concomitant reductions in polyubiquitinated protein aggregate burden along with significantly reduced plaque size and complexity. Importantly, these findings are completely abrogated in mice deficient in macrophage autophagy (ATG5-/-) or the selective autophagy chaperone (p62-/-). Further detailed pharmacokinetic evaluation of trehalose shows that physiologically relevant concentrations are indeed achievable in mice. Taken together, our data support the serious consideration of this safe and natural sugar as a potent inducer of macrophage degradative capacity in the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is the silent underlying cause of acute myocardial infarction and stroke, some of the most common causes of mortality worldwide. Aside from managing risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia, few therapies can be said to directly target atherosclerotic plaque progression partially because of remaining gaps in basic knowledge of the disease. Atherosclerosis is initiated by endothelial injury and deposition of lipids in the subendothelial layer called the intima. Circulating monocytes traffic to the site of injury, transmigrate through the endothelium, and differentiate to macrophages in an attempt to repair damage and remove lipids, much of which include deleterious oxidatively modified forms. Subsequently, plaque macrophages become central players in the progression of atherosclerosis because of a feedforward cycle of rampant lipid accumulation, proinflammatory cytokine release, cell death, and further monocyte recruitment.Article, see p 1296 A major area of focus in the field is in understanding why macrophages cannot efficiently clear lipid and cell debris deposits. Lipid species in the plaque, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), are known to induce apoptotic cell death, though the precise lipid species and signal transduction mechanisms involved are unclear. This apoptotic response may actually be adaptive in the early stages of plaque development because secondary macrophages can adeptly clear apoptotic cells through efferocytosis before cell-intrinsic damage becomes overwhelming (Figure, top left). Indeed, many features of apoptotic cell death, including expression of eat-me surface signals, are purposed toward efferocytic clearance. In contrast, secondary necrosis occurs when apoptotic cells are left unengulfed, resulting in uncontrolled disintegration, release of cytosolic components, and damage to local tissue.1 Advanced plaques lack efficient efferocytosis such that many apoptotic cells progress to secondary necrosis, adding to plaque size and complexity (Figure, top right). Thus, understanding mechanisms of apoptotic cell death in atherosclerotic plaque macrophages and the impact on overall \u2026",

However, the overall health benefits of such regimens are controversial with recent studies even suggesting an increased cardiovascular risk in certain populations. A few reports in animal models corroborate these concerns demonstrating increased LCHP-induced atherosclerosis. Interestingly, the downstream sequelae of such diets on tissues and cellular signaling are largely inferred with relevant mechanisms undefined. We first confirmed in the ApoE-null mouse model that LCHP diets are indeed atherogenic with the development of complex lesions. Using mass spectrometry, we find high protein feeding not only increases serum amino acid levels but increases amino acid load to tissues including the spleen and aorta with resultant activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway particularly in macrophages. The involvement of mTORC1 is clearly causal as the atherogenic effect of LCHP-feeding is abrogated in macrophage-specific Raptor-...",

In order to overcome the influence of the rapid and irregular movement of echocardiography videos and get more robust tracking results, we also design a trajectory description algorithm which uses the derivative of the optical flow to obtain the motion trajectory information and associates the different characteristics (e.g., the trajectory shape, DHOG, HOF, and MBH) with embedded structural information of the spatiotemporal pyramid. To avoid \u201cdimension disaster,\u201d we apply Fisher\u2019s vector to reduce the dimension of feature description followed by the SVM linear classifier to improve the final classification result.

Firstly, the pharmacophore model of PTP1B inhibitors was built based on the common feature of sixteen compounds. It was found that the pharmacophore model consisted of five chemical features: one aromatic ring (R) region, two hydrophobic (H) groups, and two hydrogen bond acceptors (A). To further elucidate the binding modes of these inhibitors with PTP1B active sites, four docking programs (AutoDock 4.0, AutoDock Vina 1.0, standard precision (SP) Glide 9.7, and extra precision (XP) Glide 9.7) were used. The characteristics of the active sites were then described by the conformations of the docking results.

Therefore, inhibition of PAK1 may be a potential approach to treat many types of solid tumors. Several allosteric inhibitors of PAK1 have been identified, and the most well known one is IPA-3. But its biological activity is not satisfied, and the structure activity relationship (SAR) of PAK1 allosteric inhibitors is unclear. In this study, we designed and synthesized 13 potential allosteric inhibitors by using computer-aided drug design based on the structure of the existing PAK1 allosteric inhibitors. All the compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR, among which six were not reported previously. SAR was investigated by pharmacological studies and In03 and In06 showed increased PAK1 inhibition than previously reported IPA-3. These findings could guide further structure optimization of PAK1 inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Transdermal delivery is one of important controlled drug release strategies for drug development. Cubic phases are the assemblies of amphiphilic molecules in water with the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interpenetrating network for transdermal delivery of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. However, many details about the transdermal delivery of cubic phases remain unclear. Here, metformin hydrochloride (Met) cubic phases were prepared with glyceryl monooleate (GMO), ethanol and water. The cubic structure was identified with the polarizing light microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering method. Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) was used for building the microstructures of the cubic phases to explore the mechanism of drug release that mainly depended on drug diffusion from the water channels of cubic phases in accordance with the Higuchi equation of in vitro release experiments. The coarse-grained model and molecular docking method showed that GMO could enhance drug permeation through the skin by disturbing the interaction between Met and the skin proteins, and increasing the fluidity of skin lipids, which was confirmed with the FT-IR spectroscopy, Langmuir monolayer, and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, in vitro permeation experiments showed the high Met transdermal improvement of cubic phases. Cubic phases are an ideal transdermal delivery system of Met. In silico methods are very useful for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of transdermal formulations.",

        "abstract": "The p38 MAPK signaling pathway plays a key role in lung inflammation and the development of acute lung injury (ALI). We previously reported that the phenolic compound procyanidin B1 inhibits inflammation by suppressing the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Here, we asked whether the monomer of procyanidin B1, epicatechin (EC), can alleviate LPS-induced ALI in mice, and if so, whether EC acts by inhibiting p38 MAPK. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups (n\u202f=\u202f8) and received EC alone, vehicle (sham group), LPS alone, or LPS and EC. LPS was administered via intraperitoneal injection and EC via nasogastric feeding. Lung histopathology, alveolocapillary membrane permeability, inflammation, and p38 MAPK pathway activation were assessed by immunohistochemistry, tissue wet/dry weight analysis, quantitative PCR, protein assays, ELISA, and western blot analysis using lung tissue and/or bronchoalveolar fluid. We also performed molecular modeling and in vitro enzymatic assays to examine the potential interaction between EC and p38 MAPK at the molecular level. We found that LPS caused an increase in ALI-associated lung pathology accompanied by activation of p-p38 pathway components and the transcription factor AP1. All of these effects were substantially reduced by treatment with EC. Furthermore, molecular modeling suggested that EC suppressed p38 MAPK signaling by hydrogen bonding with Glu71, Ala 111, Asp112, and Leu171 in the active site of p38\u03b1. In vitro kinase assays confirmed the ability of EC to directly inhibit purified p38 MAPK. Collectively, our data suggest that the naturally occurring compound EC could be a new therapeutic option for ALI.",

        "abstract": "Short peptide-based supramolecular assemblies have drawn much attention in the field of drug delivery. However, the progress still remains limited owing to the inefficient drug loading capacity of conventional short peptide-based materials. In this study, based on coordinated intramolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, we customize a dipeptide-based rhein derivative (rhein-diphenylalanine peptide, RDP), which could spontaneously form spherical nanoassemblies for drug delivery. A structure-based virtual screening of a library of small molecules is conducted to identify the suitable compounds which could be effectively delivered by this nanocarrier. Sorted by binding energy results, fifteen superior and five inferior molecules are found. Subsequently, the co-assembly capacity of high-affinity molecules (camptothecin, CPT) and low-affinity molecules (norcantharidin, NCTD) with the dipeptide-based carrier is predicted via dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation. Consistent with computational results, the in vitro experimental results show that CPT-encapsulated nanoassemblies have significant advantages in the particle size distribution and recrystallization-inhibitory effect compared with NCTD. Furthermore, in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether CPT is precisely delivered to tumor sites by using the dipeptide-based nanoassemblies. The CPT-loaded nanoassemblies show better effects in terms of drug biodistribution and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy compared to free CPT. The cooperative computational and experimental strategies (in vitro and in vivo) used in this work lay a good foundation to systematically understand short peptide-based assemblies for precise drug delivery.",

In this work, we have synthesized a novel fluorescent chemosensor  SQ  with a polyether chain to enhance water solubility, and this has been used for the detection of human serum albumin (HSA) in aqueous solution with excellent sensitivity and selectivity.  SQ  was aggregated into nanoparticles with an average particle size of 458\u00a0nm in neutral solution and showed fluorescence silent due to the aggregation-induced quenching. However, addition of HSA decreased the average particle size of  SQ  to 295\u00a0nm and released the fluorescence because of the reassembly of the  SQ -HSA complex. More importantly, HSA could be selectively detected in the presence of other biological proteins and the main physiological inorganic anions and cations with the detection limit estimated as 15.6\u00a0nM according to 3\u03c3/ k . This versatile strategy suggests that squaraine dyes can be used as fluorescence-enhanced probes for the quantitative detection of HSA as well as in applications for the detection of HSA in urine samples.",

        "abstract": "A primary focus of this research was to explore the activation process and mechanism of decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, DAC) prodrug. Recently, it has been reported that biphenyl hydrolase-like protein (BPHL) can play an important role in the activation of some amino acid nucleoside prodrugs with a general preference for hydrophobic amino acids and 5'-esters. Therefore, we put forward a bold hypothesis that this novel enzyme may be primarily responsible for the activation process of DAC prodrug as well. 5'-O-L-valyl-decitabine (L-val-DAC) was synthesized before and can be transported across biological membranes by the oligopeptide transporter (PEPT1), granting it much greater utility in vivo. In this report, L-val-DAC was found to be a good substrate of BPHL protein (K  0.59\u00a0mM; k /K  553.69\u00a0mM\u00a0s). After intestinal absorption, L-val-DAC was rapidly and almost completely hydrolyzed to DAC and L-valine. The catalysis was mainly mediated by the BPHL hydrolase and resulted in the intestinal first-pass effect of L-val-DAC after oral administration in Sprague-Dawley rats with cannulated jugular and portal veins. The structural insights using computational molecular docking showed that BPHL had a unique binding mode for L-val-DAC. As a fundamental basis, the simulation was employed to explain the catalytic mechanism in molecular level. In conclusion, BPHL was at least one of the primary candidate enzymes for L-val-DAC prodrug activation. This promising double-targeted prodrug approach have more advantages than the traditional targeted designs due to its higher transport and more predictable activation, thereby leading to a favorable property for oral delivery.",

        "abstract": "Photosensitizer-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted great attention in cancer treatment. However, achieving efficient delivery of photosensitizers is still a great challenge for their clinical applications. The photosensitizer-encapsulating delivery nanosystem usually suffers from poor stability, complex preparation process and low drug loading. Herein, we utilize a surfactant-like chemotherapeutic agent, mitoxantrone (MTX), as a nanocarrier to deliver a photosensitizer pyropheophorbide a (PPa) for antitumor therapy. MTX consists of aromatic rings (hydrophobic part) and two amino-groups and two hydroxyl-groups (hydrophilic part) with planar structure, which could interact with PPa via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, hydrophobic interactions, intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. This system (PPa@MTX) spontaneously forms near-spherical nanostructures (\u223c150 nm), has a high loading capacity for PPa (56.5%) and exhibits a pH-responsive drug release manner in vitro. In vivo antitumor efficacy evaluations show that the pegylated PPa@MTX nanosystem has increased accumulation in tumor tissues and enhanced antitumor efficacy in female BALB/c mice bearing murine mammary carcinoma (4T1) tumor cells, compared to free PPa. Employing the surfactant-like drug as nanocarriers, our results show that the \"drug-delivering-drug\" strategy is a good foundation for the development of novel PDT-based drug delivery system against cancer.",

Spectral tuning mechanism controlled by ambient temperature at pulse laser excitation is revealed, and a mechanism based on the modification on multi-phonon relaxation rates for the rapid population of intermediate level  3 H 4  and multi-phonon-assisted excited state absorption is proposed. Based on multi-phonon relaxation theory and time-resolved photoluminescence studies, it is reasonable that UC luminescence under short-pulse laser excitation mainly originates from the ions at/near the surface of NPs. These exciting findings in ambient temperature accompanied with the short-pulse excitation dependent UC selectivity offer a general approach to tailoring lanthanide related UC emissions, which will benefit multicolor displays and imaging.",

        "abstract": "Doping and varying pump laser parameters are the widely applied technological processes for tuning spectra to yield desirable luminescence properties and functions. For micro/nanocrystalline materials, doping is of fundamental importance in modifying electronic properties, modulating magnetism, as well as tuning the red-to-green luminescence ratio. Here we describe a tunable upconversion (UC) emission process in single NaYF:Yb/Er microtubes excitated with a focused laser. We show that the emission colours from single NaYF:Yb/Er microtubes can be rationally tuned in the red-to-green luminescence ratio and dynamics process by elevating Yb ion concentration or pump power density. The underlying mechanism of spectral tuning is explored by using the power dependent UC luminescence, downconversion spectra and the temporal evolutions of UC emission from a series of single NaYF:Yb/Er microtubes. A mechanism of the red luminescence enhancement based on mediating electronic energy transfer channels by inducing three-photon processes is proposed for single microtubes. The natural decays of the luminescence levels are modified in the UC process relative to downconversion, which could be interpreted by using rate equations. Here, an insight into UC processes by use of unconventional focused experimental and theoretical techniques indicates the bidirectional feature of the electron transition of the interexcited-state by linear decays and UC processes via controlling external experimental parameters.",

        "abstract": "Lanthanide (Ln)-doped upconversion (UC) micro/nanomaterials have attracted significant attention in various applications. However, spatial control of UC emission from micro/nanomaterials has not been developed to date due to the ineffective quantum yield and weak luminescence intensity. In this study, the fascinating luminescent patterns, including a dual-colour dumbbell, sunflower, rod-shaped candy, dichroic plate, and coloured ring from a series of single NaYF4:Yb/Ln (Ln = Er, Ho, and Tm) microcrystals, that exhibit different distinctive distributions on luminescence intensity and colour in space are obtained by varying the excitation modes. The overall integral UC intensity of a single microtube by waveguiding-excitation is invariably stronger relative to that in the case of the spot-excitation approach, and the enhancement factor increases 10 times. We explained the underlying physical mechanisms behind the changes in the colour and intensity of the luminescent pattern based on the native diffraction and interference effect of microcrystals. These findings provide a new way to improve UC luminescence and facilitate a basic understanding of the use of UC micro/nanocrystals as natural interference devices, which will result in new applications in displays, optical waveguides, and anti-counterfeiting.",

        "abstract": "Optical hysteresis behavior (OHB) is of great importance for technological applications including optical data switching and manipulation. In this study, the power-dependent luminescent property of a single one-dimensional NaYbF4:X3+ (X = Er, Ho, and Tm) microcrystal was systematically investigated. We observed the interesting OHB that a system exhibits two different optical responses for the same laser input. A series of real colour luminescence patterns with information-rich upconversion cryptography were also obtained, which offers great opportunities for optical barcoding at the single particle level. The intrinsic OHB strongly depends on excitation approach, excitation power density range, Yb3+ concentration and sample crystallinity rather than active center. The underlying mechanisms of the intrinsic OHB and luminescence loss were explored, and a mechanism based on permanent local structural changes and intrinsic defect induced luminescence quenching is proposed. The laser thermal effect was confirmed by decreased luminescence intensity ratio of 2H11/2 \u2192 4I15/2 to 4S3/2 \u2192 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ as the excitation power increased. The luminescent loss includes both irreversible and reversible processes, and these two processes can be distinguished via excitation power cycling experiments. Reversible luminescence loss contributed to defect quenching due to energy migration from Yb3+ to the native defects, and irreversible luminescence quenching originated from the thermally induced permanent local structural changes of microcrystals. This work not only enables a deeper understanding of power-dependent OHB in related systems, but also provides the new dimensions for special applications such as multilevel anti-counterfeiting and intelligent memory storage.",

        "abstract": "Power systems have increasingly exhibited a need for a potential frequency governor with virtual inertial control (VIC) and primary frequency regulation (PFR) functions in recent years, due to the increased penetration of wind turbines that almost have no frequency response. In this paper, a novel integrated frequency governor applied to a wind turbine is proposed to provide fast active power support and scheduled power allocation for both temporary inertial response and continued PFR. Below rated wind speed, an initial pitch angle is calculated firstly to preset a proper de-loading level for PFR in response to frequency drops, according to the presented relations of CP-\u03bb-\u03b2. Under the de-loading operation conditions, the de-loading power tracking curve is replaced by the defined VIC curves, and the inertial response is then obtained by rapidly shifting the VIC curves. Based on analysis of the mechanical characteristics of wind turbines with frequency droop, a primary frequency control strategy facilitated by the regulation of pitch angles is additionally proposed. A preset \u03b2/f droop curve is added to the de-loading pitch controller to regulate the mechanical power for scheduled power allocation, and thus satisfying the P/f droop demand of system PFR. Finally, the experiments and simulation results demonstrate that by using the proposed frequency governor a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbine can provide both temporary virtual inertia and continued load sharing to improve the dynamic frequency stability of the power grid with high wind power penetration.",

According to the characteristics of the fault current circuit when the pole-to-ground fault occurs, the three stages of fault process were presented in detail. Firstly, the voltage of capacitor and fault current expressions of DC-side capacitor discharge stage were derived. Secondly, the state equation of grid-side current feeding stage was listed. Thirdly, the distribution of DC-side capacitor voltage in voltage recovery stage was analyzed. Moreover, for different grounding resistance, the fault characteristics of the system in each stage were analyzed, which was divided into under-damping and over-damping.

The proposed strategy switches the control mode of the PV grid connected inverter and the battery energy storage during power oscillations according to the frequency deviation and State-of-Charge(SOC) of Battery which avoids the deep charge and discharge of energy storage device.

This paper mainly studies the capacitor discharge stage. Firstly, the multi-terminal DC system is decomposed into n single-ended systems. Secondly, write the state equation of the single-ended system and solve the expression of fault current and voltage. Thirdly, get the fault analysis expression of the multi-terminal system by the relationship expressions for each transient value between single-ended system and multi-terminal system. The simulation are carried out by MATLAB / Simulink to provide the basis for fault location and isolation.",

        "abstract": "When the variable speed wind turbines with virtual inertia are connected to the grid, the transient stability control of the interconnected system will be more flexible. Firstly, the linearized state equation of equivalent two-machine system with wind power was derived, and respective influences of terminal unit inertial changes on the transient stability of power system were analyzed. Secondly, a power angle transient stability control strategy based on inertia regulation was proposed, which can improve the system transient stability by coordinating the inertia of two sub-regions. Finally, this paper established a simulation model of the two regional power grids with high wind power penetration. The simulation results verified the correctness of the analysis results and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",

        "abstract": "An integrated controller of wind turbines with both inertial response and primary frequency regulation (PFR) to provide complete dynamic frequency support for the grid with high wind power penetration is investigated. The wind turbine control governor contains two cross-coupled controllers: pitch controller and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller. First, as a precondition for the PFR, a de-loading pitch control scheme is proposed to reserve capacity required for frequency regulation. Then, by optimizing the MPPT scheme, the rapid virtual inertia response is achieved even under de-loading operation condition. Based on the analysis of the steady-state characteristics of wind turbines with frequency droop control, the primary frequency control strategy, which enables the adjustment of frequency droop coefficient, is further proposed through pitch angle changes. Thus, the PFR and inertial response can be both achieved by the proposed de-loading pitch controller and optimized MPPT controller. A three-machine prototype system containing two synchronous generators and a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine with 30% of wind penetration is implemented to validate the proposed integrated control strategies on providing inertial response and subsequent load sharing in the event of frequency change.",

Several lncRNAs were identified by using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. The expression levels of several lncRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. We analyzed the effect of lncRNAs that act cis to the target genes. lncRNA targeting genes were involved in signaling pathways associated with growth and development of muscle by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Through our study, we provide a comprehensive expression profile of muscle lncRNAs in sheep, which provides valuable resources for further understanding genetic regulation of muscle growth and development from the perspective of lncRNA.",

To understand the role of miRNAs in sheep vertebrae development, the purpose of this article is to screen candidate microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with sheep spine development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a rich family of small regulatory RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing techniques to analyze the microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profiles of L6 (6 lumbar vertebrae) and L7 (7 lumbar vertebrae) in sheep. A total number of 223 miRNAs were detected in the two libraries, and a total of 150 and 148 conserved miRNAs were obtained in L6 and L7, respectively. A total of 5 miRNAs expression differences in L6 compared to L7 (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Of the five obviously differently expressed miRNAs, four miRNAs were down-regulated in the L6 of sheep, and one was up-regulated. In order to further explore the functions of these miRNAs, we predicted the target genes of these differently expressed miRNAs, and obtained 1298 target genes. At the same time, NDRG2 gene, targeted by novel miR-391, which possible plays an important role in the development of the spine. Linkage-integration analysis method was used to construct the interaction network of spinal-associated miRNA and its hypothesized target. In summary, this study provides valuable resources for the transcriptome of multiple vertebral traits in sheep.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short-chain RNA molecules of ~22 nucleotides in length and regulate gene expression at posttranscriptional levels by interacting with mRNAs. Although many miRNAs have been identified, the expression and function of miRNAs in the pituitary gland of sheep are still unclear. In this study, the identity and abundance of miRNAs were determined in the sheep pituitary gland of prenatal and postnatal stages. We showed that 107 miRNAs are significantly (<0.05) differentially expressed in pituitary glands between the prenatal and postnatal stages, and 44 new miRNA candidates were found according to a series of filtration criteria. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of several miRNAs. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that sheep miRNAs were expressed in prenatal and postnatal pituitary glands. We found that miRNAs were involved in hormone synthesis, secretion and signalling pathway regulation by gene ontology (GO) and KEGG concentration analysis. Our study provides valuable resources for comprehensive investigation of miRNAs in the pituitary gland and biology of sheep.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate vertebral variation and the association with carcass length and weight in Kazakh sheep. We examined thoracic (T) and lumbar (L) vertebral variation by splitting carcass on 468 Kazakh sheep. Seven kinds of vertebrae formations were discovered. The majority (74.14%) of sheep had 13 thoracic and 6 lumbar (T13L6), and other variations included T13L7 (12.34%), T14L6 (10.68%), T14L5 (1.28%), T12L6 (0.64%), T12L7 (0.21%) and T14L7 (0.21%). Moreover, carcass length of T13L7 and T14L6 sheep, possessing one more lumbar or thoracic vertebrae, respectively increased 2.22\u00a0cm and 2.93\u00a0cm compared with that of normal T13L6 sheep. Similarly, carcass weight of T13L7 and T14L6 sheep raised 1.68\u00a0kg and 1.90\u00a0kg, respectively, when compared with that of T13L6 sheep. Our results suggested that multi-vertebrae variation of Kazakh sheep could contribute to carcass length and weight.",

The liquid crystal (LC)-based steering screen was specially developed to deflect light beams over a small range and operate in synchronism with the projector array with the use of a customized FPGA driver. The prototype produces vivid color 3D scenes with smooth parallax to multiple viewers. The experimental results verify the proposed multi-projection time-multiplexed multi-view 3D display method that uses a steering screen to produce dense views. Displaying both static and dynamic 3D contents is achieved in our implemented 36-view 3D display prototype. The results of crosstalk measurements are given and analyzed to evaluate the display performance.",

However, an integrated discussion connecting capture and display has been long neglected. Therefore, this paper proposes a duality analysis of capture and display to comprehensively analyze and define two basic attributes; depth range and angular resolution. The main contribution of this paper is to discuss the display properties based on the configurations of light field capture and its effect on displayed image quality rather than focusing on the display itself.",

The proposed 3D display system comprises: a fast liquid-crystal-display (LCD), a lenticular lens and a beam steering screen. The lenticular lens is customized for the LCD screen so as to project the display image into different directions. The beam steering screen is fabricated by using two layers of twisted-nematic (TN) LC cells with micro-prism-array(MPA) substrates, and multiple polarization statues can be produced by regulating the biasing voltages on the steering screen. Image light beam from the LCD screen is firstly split by the lenticular lens, and then further deflected to desired directions by the steering screen. Thus, the proposed method implements temporal multiplexing onto common spatial multiplexing multi-view displays, and dense viewing zones are created horizontally in space. A complete prototype based on this technology has been developed, and the proof of concept has been verified by experimental results.",

Our multi-layer light field display enables a far smaller form factor than other types, and faster algorithms along with horizontal parallax-only will considerably speed-up computation time. A spin-off of this technology is a near-eye display that provides focus cues for maximizing user comfort. Head tracked displays use liquid crystal display panels illuminated with a directional backlight to produce multiple sets of exit pupil pairs that follow the user\u2019s eyes under the control of a head position tracker. Our super multiview display (SMV) system uses high frame-rate projectors for spatio-temporal multiplexing that give dense viewing zones with no accommodation/convergence (A/C) conflict. Bandwidth reduction is achieved by discarding redundant information at capture. The status of the latest prototypes and their performance is described; and we conclude by indicating the future directions of our research.",

        "abstract": "Gesture control is an emerging technological goal in the field of human\u2013machine interfaces (HMIs). Optical fibers or metal strain sensors as sensing elements are generally complex and not sensitive enough to accurately capture gestures, and thus there is a need for additional complicated signal optimization. Electronic sensing textiles hold great promise for the next generation of wearable electronics. Here, soft, deformable and ultrahigh-performance textile strain sensors are fabricated by directly stencil printing silver ink on pre-stretched textiles towards HMIs. These textile strain sensors exhibit ultrahigh sensitivity (a gauge factor of \u223c2000), stretchability (up to 60% strain), and durability (u003e10\u2006000 stretching cycles). Through a simple auxiliary signal processing circuit with Bluetooth communication technology, an intelligent glove assembled with these textile strain sensors is prepared, which is capable of detecting the full range of fingers\u2019 bending and can translate the fingers\u2019 bending into wireless control commands. Immediate applications, for example, as a smart car director, for wireless typing, and as a remote PowerPoint controller, bring out the great practical value of these textile strain sensors in the field of wearable electronics. This work provides a new prospective for achieving wearable sensing electronic textiles with ultrahigh performance towards HMIs, and will further expand their impact in the field of the Internet of Things.",

Coding and use of mechanotransduction signals from artificial tactile perception make a vital contribution to provide tactile feedback for robots, prosthetics, and rehabilitation therapy. Here we propose a hetero-contact microstructure (HeCM) to fabricate tactile sensor by using silver nanowires@polyurethane scaffold combined with layered carbon fabric. The synergistically perceiving of the HeCM enables the mechanosensational range of tactile sensor to be programmatically and significantly enhanced by u003e100% compared to the one of the common counterpart. The as-designed sensor characterizes high sensitivity, fast response time, and reproducible electromechanical properties to identify static and dynamic external pressure changes. Actual fingertip events can be converted into visual or audio interactive feedback in virtual reality by the intelligent sensor, demonstrating the feasibility and practicality of design concept and great potential of the sensor for human-interactive system.",

The 3-D numerical simulation demonstrates that this new device has steep subthreshold swing (<60 mV/dec) over several orders of magnitude of drain current, suppressed drain-induced barrier-lowering of similar to 46 mV/V and enhanced I-on/I-off ratio up to 10(9) orders of magnitude. It is found that I-on begins to increase when SiO2 core radius exceeds a specified value (similar to 4 nm) due to quantum confinement effect. By modulation of the SiO2 core radius and Si shell doping, an optimized manufacturing solution of this kind of the device is obtained.",

Then, bearings only measurements association test is used for determining whether the measurements in the radar network are in the direction of the benchmark radar. Measurements passing the bearings only measurements association test will be taken the nearest neighbor association test with measurements in the classified groups of the benchmark radar.

A novel detection approach is proposed by employing Hough transform track-before-detect (HT-TBD) technique based on grading and dimensionality reduction mechanism. Firstly, in order to solve huge computational load problem of traditional three-dimensional Hough transform, three-dimensional points are mapped into range-time plane, azimuth-time plane and elevation-time plane successively for three corresponding two-dimensional Hough transforms. Then, a new double integration means of noncoherent integration and binary integration is adopted in parameter space to select points in every stage orderly, which could make full use of energy information and decrease impact from strong interference at the same time. Finally, motion constraints and trajectory merging are introduced to further reduce detected false trajectories after sequence association for detected points.

Firstly, measurements crossing ambiguity intervals found out by hypothesis testing are compensated in range dimension for rebuilding lost spatial-temporal correlativity due to range ambiguity. Then, modified triple-stage HT-TBD approach is carried on for target point detection. Considering that standard three-dimensional HT-TBD brings about huge computational load, to reduce computation cost and ensure detection performance, three-dimensional measurements are mapped into three two-dimensional planes for point selections in every stage by two-dimensional Hough transform. Besides, point selection is employed by a new double integration means of noncoherent integration and binary integration in parameter space to make full use of energy information and decrease impact from strong interference simultaneously.

Firstly, the radar echo signal is pre-processed by blind source separation in the signal layer to improve the signal-to-interference ratio and solve the cross-interference problem between the target echoes. Then, according to the different properties of Linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal in different conversion orders in the Fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domain, the LFM signal is narrowband filtered and the doppler frequency is estimated to filter out the energy of most interference and noise, and provide the aiming information of the target radial velocity for the data layer processing respectively. Finally, in the data layer, M / N logic method is used to deal with all the points, and combined with the radial velocity decision algorithm to achieve the target track detection.

        "abstract": "Due to the stochastic nature of renewable generation, power system planning with high penetration of renewables is challenging. Analyzing the influence of renewable energy variability on system reliability is of crucial importance in power system planning. There are two well-known approaches in incorporating renewable generation: the negative load approach and the multi-state generation approach. The objective of this study is to review the performance of these two methods in quantifying system reliability. Both pros and cons of each method are discussed based on experiments conducted using public data for both wind and solar power generation. Reliability indices are quantified using these two representations of renewable generation. In addition, this paper analyzes how representative a single-year renewable generation profile is, by comparing the reliability indices using multiple-year renewable energy data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   With the advent of the smart grid, demand response (DR) has been implemented in many electric utility control areas to reduce peak demand in buildings during grid stress conditions. However, small- and medium-sized commercial buildings typically do not deploy a building energy management (BEM) system due to high costs of commercially available solutions. Thus, their participation in DR events implies manual control and shutting down major building loads (e.g., air conditioning systems) without considering occupant comfort. With rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, some cost-effective IoT-based BEM systems have become available. Based on such systems, this paper presents an algorithm to automatically coordinate the operation of rooftop units (RTUs) in small- and medium-sized commercial buildings, thereby meeting the specified power limit (kW) during a DR event while taking into account occupant comfort. The proposed algorithm has been designed to intelligently learn building thermal properties using coarse-grained indoor temperature data from thermostats, thus avoiding the deployment of sophisticated sensors network. A mixed-integer linear programming model has been utilized to determine an optimal RTU control strategy during a DR event. The peak load shedding performance of the proposed strategy has been tested in an office building in Blacksburg, VA, USA. The experimental result demonstrates that the building could achieve the required peak load reduction and the computation time required by the proposed algorithm is less than 5\u00a0min. This implies that with the proposed algorithm a building is capable of responding to a DR signal with a short notice, providing valuable demand-side resources for electricity capacity and ancillary markets.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of smart meters and Internet-of-Things technologies, buildings are becoming smarter, and capable of participating in demand response (DR) programs. Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units, as one of the major loads in buildings and due to their cyclic operating characteristics, are excellent candidates for peak load management. A prerequisite to HVAC control for peak load management is to know their power consumption. While many studies assume that HVAC units consume fixed rated power during their operation, field measurements show that this value is not fixed but varies with outdoor temperature. Performing DR using the fixed power consumption model may result in unexpected load reduction, i.e., the reduction may be lower or higher than expected. Although power consumption measurements of individual HVAC units can provide necessary data, it is prohibitively expensive to install a power meter for each HVAC unit. To reduce hardware investments, this paper proposes an algorithm to derive power-temperature models of individual HVAC units from a single power meter that measures the power consumption of all HVAC units. Research findings indicate that the power consumption of individual HVAC units can be precisely modeled and disaggregated from a single power meter data.",

        "abstract": "A building energy management (BEM) system serves as the key element of a smart building. It facilitates grid interaction and participation of a building in a demand response (DR) program. Typically, a BEM has been designed to manage loads in a single building. However, in reality, a number of adjacently located buildings can be owned by a single entity, like a campus. In this case, during DR events, instead of optimized control of loads in a single building, the coordinated control of loads in multiple buildings should be conducted to ensure the best operation condition for the entire facility. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to coordinate the operation of loads in multiple buildings, thereby reducing the peak demand of the entire facility during a DR event while minimizing occupant discomfort. Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework for coordinated control of multiple buildings results in less occupant discomfort than controlling loads in each building individually.",

        "abstract": "\nThe valence-band offset (VBO) of n-Zn0.8Mg0.2O/p-Ni0.8Mg0.2O heterojunction grown by pulsed laser deposition was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Core levels of Zn 2p and Ni 2p were used to align the VBO of n-Zn0.8Mg0.2O/p-Ni0.8Mg0.2O heterojunction. It was found that n-Zn0.8Mg0.2O/p-Ni0.8Mg0.2O heterojunction has a type-II band alignment and its VBO is determined to be 1.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0eV, and conduction-band offset is deduced to be \u22121.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0eV. Alloying with Mg can tune the positions of valence-band maximum (VBM), conduction-band minimum (CBM) and bandgaps of both Zn1\u2212x Mg x O and Ni1\u2212x Mg x O thin films, according to which we can design various heterojunction devices with desired CBM and VBM values of both sides by tuning appropriate Mg composition. Also, there is blue shift of absorption edges of the integral Zn0.8Mg0.2O/Ni0.8Mg0.2O heterojunction, which has a significant impact on the design and application of deep-ultraviolet optoelectronic devices, such as solar-blind UV detectors with high photoresponse performance.",

Here, ambient particulate matter (PM) were collected into thirteen different size ranges (10 nm-18 \u03bcm) and the mass, metal, endotoxin distributions and related oxidative potential were investigated in two regions (Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland and Beijing, China). Results showed that the two regions had remarkably different PM distribution patterns. Swiss urban samples had a mode around 40 nm with 23.3% of total PM mass, while Chinese samples featured two modes around 0.75 and 4.23 \u03bcm with 13.8 -18.6% and 13.7-20.4% of total PM mass, respectively. Two peaks for endotoxin at 40-100 nm and 1-4 \u03bcm were observed in different regions. For PM-borne metals, Chinese samples had 67.6-100% of total Cd, As and Pb in the size range of 0.1-1 \u03bcm, and Swiss samples had similar distributions of Cd and Pb but much lower total metals than Chinese samples. The PM oxidative potential varied greatly with sizes for different regions. Accordingly, the current practice, i.e., sole use of the mass concentration, could lead to inadequate health protection for one region, but unnecessary economic costs for another without achieving extra health benefits.",

The dLABer system was further shown to have an up to 104 higher signal-to-noise ratio than that of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) when analyzing the same breath samples. In addition, both blood-borne IL-6 levels analyzed via ELISA in rats injected with different PM extracts and PM toxicity determined by a dithiothreitol (DTT) assay agreed well with those determined by the dLABer system. Video recordings further verified that rats exposed to PM with higher toxicity (according to a DTT assay and as revealed by dLABer) appeared to be less physically active. All the data presented here suggest that the dLABer system is capable of real-time, noninvasive monitoring of breath-borne biomarkers with ultrasensitivity. The dLABer system is expected to revolutionize pollutant health effect studies and bedside disease diagnosis as well as physiological condition monitoring at the single-protein level.",

In this paper, a digital compressed sensing- (CS-) based single-spot Bluetooth ECG node is proposed to deal with the challenge in wireless ECG application. A periodic sleep/wake-up scheme and a CS-based compression algorithm are implemented in a node, which consists of ultra-low-power analog front-end, microcontroller, Bluetooth 4.0 communication module, and so forth. The efficiency improvement and the node's specifics are evidenced by the experiments using the ECG signals sampled by the proposed node under daily activities of lay, sit, stand, walk, and run. Under using sparse binary matrix (SBM), block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) method, and discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis, all ECG signals were essentially undistorted recovered with root-mean-square differences (PRDs) which are less than 6%. The proposed sleep/wake-up scheme and data compression can reduce the airtime over energy-hungry wireless links, the energy consumption of proposed node is 6.53\u2009mJ, and the energy consumption of radio decreases 77.37%. Moreover, the energy consumption increase caused by CS code execution is negligible, which is 1.3% of the total energy consumption.",

However, most special BSPM recording devices are cost and relatively rare. An alternative method is proposed for BSPM recording using two common 64 leads electroencephalogram (EEG) amplifiers. The recording technics includes 117 torso and three limb electrodes of silver-silver chloride, and ECG signals are sampled simultaneously and recorded in digital format with Wilsonu0027s central terminal as reference. The BSPM data of one healthy volunteer (male, 24-year-old) was recorded by the proposed method. Considering the inherent mismatched impedance between the subject and the device, a zero-phase bandpass filter was applied for recorded data correction, and then reconstructed the maps. The potential distribution pattern of reconstructed BSPMs are well corresponded with the cardiac activity level, especially during the QRST complex. The results show that the proposed method is feasible and it is an optional choice for BSPM recording.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the major causes of death. Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms of MI and its clinical features, especially its relationship with common electrocardiography measurements, is important. Heart modeling provides a possible method to simulate certain heart conditions. In this paper, a refined MI torso-heart model was proposed to explore the effect of inferior MI on simulated electrocardiograms. This model simulated the electrical activity of a normal heart and an inferior MI heart at three sites (basal, middle, and apical) with three MI sizes (small, moderate, and large), aiming to investigate the effect of inferior MI on the simulated electrocardiograms. Simulated body surface potential maps were compared with clinical body surface potential maps to verify the efficiency of the model. A new measure, namely, the  normalized variation coefficient , was proposed for result evaluation. The results showed that the augmented unipolar left lower limb lead was the best choice for inferior MI diagnoses and it showed the most obvious electrocardiography signal differences between normal and inferior MI hearts. The simulation results corresponded well with commonly used clinical diagnostic criteria. Thus, the proposed refined MI torso-heart model provides a finite element simulation method for quantifying the effects of inferior MI on a torso-heart model-based electrocardiogram and has good potential for use in optimizing electrocardiogram detection.",

        "abstract": "Recently, development of wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enables the real-time and continuous individual electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. In this study, we develop a novel IoT-based wearable 12-lead ECG SmartVest system for early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which consists of four typical IoT components: 1) sensing layer using textile dry ECG electrode; 2) network layer utilizing Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.; 3) cloud saving and calculation platform and server; and 4) application layer for signal analysis and decision making. We focus on addressing the challenge of real-time signal quality assessment (SQA) and lightweight QRS detection for wearable ECG application. First, a combination method of multiple signal quality indices and machine learning is proposed for classifying 10-s single-channel ECG segments as acceptable and unacceptable. Then a lightweight QRS detector is developed for accurate location of QRS complexes. The results show that the proposed SQA method can efficiently deal with trade-off between accepting good (97.9%) and rejecting poor (96.4%) quality ECGs, ensuring that only a low percentage of recorded ECGs are discarded. The proposed lightweight QRS detector achieves a F1 score higher than 99.5% for processing clean ECGs. Meanwhile, it reports significantly higher F1 scores than two existing QRS detectors for processing noisy ECGs. In addition, it also has a fine computation efficiency. This work demonstrates that the developed IoT-driven ECG SmartVest system can be applied for widely monitoring the population during daily life and has a promising application future.",

        "abstract": "A path-aware approach to mutant reduction which explores mutant reduction from the perspective of the path depth in the program under test.Four mutant reduction strategies which are developed with different priorities among the four heuristic rules for mutant reduction.An empirical study which evaluates effectiveness of the mutant reduction strategies with 11 C programs. Context: Mutation testing, which systematically generates a set of mutants by seeding various faults into the base program under test, is a popular technique for evaluating the effectiveness of a testing method. However, it normally requires the execution of a large amount of mutants and thus incurs a high cost.Objective: A common way to decrease the cost of mutation testing is mutant reduction, which selects a subset of representative mutants. In this paper, we propose a new mutant reduction approach from the perspective of program structure.Method: Our approach attempts to explore path information of the program under test, and select mutants that are as diverse as possible with respect to the paths they cover. We define two path-aware heuristic rules, namely module-depth and loop-depth rules, and combine them with statement- and operator-based mutation selection to develop four mutant reduction strategies.Results: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of our mutant reduction strategies against random mutant selection on 11 real-life C programs with varying sizes and sampling ratios. Our empirical studies show that two of our mutant reduction strategies, which primarily rely on the path-aware heuristic rules, are more effective and systematic than pure random mutant selection strategy in terms of selecting more representative mutants. In addition, among all four strategies, the one giving loop-depth the highest priority has the highest effectiveness.Conclusion: In general, our path-aware approach can reduce the number of mutants without jeopardizing its effectiveness, and thus significantly enhance the overall cost-effectiveness of mutation testing. Our approach is particularly useful for the mutation testing on large-scale complex programs that normally involve a huge amount of mutants with diverse fault characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, applications are increasingly deployed as Web services in the globally distributed cloud computing environment. Multiple services are normally composed to fulfill complex functionalities. Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (WS-BPEL) is an XML-based service composition language that is used to define a complex business process by orchestrating multiple services. Compared with traditional applications, WS-BPEL programs pose many new challenges to the quality assurance, especially testing, of service compositions. A number of techniques have been proposed for testing WS-BPEL programs, but only a few studies have been conducted to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques. Mutation testing has been widely acknowledged as not only a testing method in its own right but also a popular technique for measuring the fault-detection effectiveness of other testing methods. Several previous studies have proposed a family of mutation operators for generating mutants by seeding various faults into WS-BPEL programs. In this study, we conduct a series of empirical studies to evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of various mutation operators for WS-BPEL programs. The experimental results provide insightful and comprehensive guidance for mutation testing of WS-BPEL programs in practice. In particular, our work is the systematic study in the selection of effective mutation operators specifically for WS-BPEL programs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) enables the coordination of multiple loosely coupled services. This allows users to choose any service provided by the SOA without knowing implementation details, thus making coding easier and more flexible. Web services are basic units of SOA. However, the functionality of a single Web service is limited, and usually cannot completely satisfy the actual demand. Hence, it is necessary to coordinate multiple independent Web services to achieve complex business processes. Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (WS-BPEL) makes the coordination possible, by helping the integration of multiple Web services and providing an interface for users to invoke. When coordinating these services, however, illegal or faulty operations may be encountered, but current tools are not yet powerful enough to support the localisation and removal of these problems. In this paper, we propose a fault localisation technique for WS-BPEL programs based on predicate switching and program slicing, allowing developers to more precisely locate the suspicious faulty code. Case studies were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, which was compared with predicate switching only, slicing only, and one existing fault localisation technique, namely Tarantula. The experimental results show that the proposed technique has a higher fault localisation effectiveness and precision than the baseline techniques.",

        "abstract": "Mutation analysis is a classical software testing approach which attempts to imitate faults using a set of mutants. It has been advocated to be an appropriate technique for evaluating the quality of test suites as well as the effectiveness of a testing method. However, the applicability of mutation analysis, especially in many practical situations, has been hindered due to the high computation cost and the long execution time, which are mainly caused by the large number of mutants. Numerous studies, particularly those based on parallel computing, have been conducted to reduce the overhead of mutation analysis. In this paper, we aim to improve the efficiency of mutation analysis from a different perspective. We make use of lightweight program analysis techniques to identify a group of mutants that share the common execution traces before the mutation location, and then merge them into a synthesized program with the concurrent mechanism, on which mutation analysis can be efficiently executed without the duplicate execution of common traces. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach can significantly decrease the computation overhead as well as shorten the execution time of mutation analysis, without jeopardizingitseffectiveness. Thein-depthanalysisfurthershows thattheeffectivenessofourapproachispositivelycorrelatedwith thenumberofbranchesintheprogramundertest. Ourapproach makes it possible to efficiently execute mutation analysis even without the need of advanced computer architectures.",

First, this paper compared the general characteristics of press pack insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), injection-enhanced gate transistor (IEGT), and integrated gate commutated thyristor (IGCT). Then working conditions of devices were analyzed from the perspective of HCBs. According to these, vital features of devices including maximum turn-off current, on-state voltage, conduction ability, and robustness of power semiconductor devices were carefully analyzed and compared. Related experiments were implemented to compare maximum turn-off capability, and the 4.5 kV/3 kA IGBT/IEGT was able to turn off 19 and 22 kA respectively after 5-ms current conduction. Analysis and experiments indicated that IGCT was suitable for natural commutation low-voltage and low-current hybrid circuit breakers, due to its low on-state voltage and huge surge current conduction ability. Comparatively, IGBT and IEGT were more suitable for very high current interruption, and IEGT was the superior selection among available commercial devices. However, the interference should be considered in applications.",

        "abstract": "DC fault protection is one of the biggest challenge to multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) systems, because DC current has no natural zero crossing point. To overcome this problem, hybrid DC circuit breaker (DCCB), which serves as a promising solution to the isolation of DC faults, has been developed. However, hybrid DCCB contains a huge number of power semiconductors, which is costly and inefficient especially in MTDC. This paper proposed a novel hybrid DCCB for nodes in MTDC system. By optimizing the topology and corresponding control strategy of traditional hybrid DCCB, the requirement of power semiconductors is reduced without degrading the performance. The novel hybrid DCCB is verified by simulations of a four-terminal radial DC grid with MATLAB/Simulink.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid direct current circuit breakers (DCCBs) have great prospects for the isolation of dc faults in multi-terminal dc grids. Current commutation from the mechanical switch branch to the static DCCB branch is the precondition to interrupt fault currents successfully for the hybrid DCCBs. A current commutation drive circuit (CCDC) is presented in this study, and it has features of low cost, low operating losses and free maintenance. Experiments have been carried out on a unidirectional 44 kV hybrid DCCB prototype with CCDC. The results show the current of 3.4 kA can be commutated by CCDC within 130 \u03bcs, and be interrupted successfully within 2 ms. For a bidirectional 80 kV hybrid DCCB cell, the effectiveness of CCDC is validated with simulations carried out in PACAD. Then, an index is defined to represent the current commutation capability of CCDC and a mathematical model for CCDC is established to calculate the index. To reduce the cost of CCDC with certain current commutation capability, an optimisation method based on genetic algorithm is proposed in this study. According to the optimisation results of CCDC suitable for bidirectional 80 kV hybrid DCCB cell, the cost of CCDC has been reduced by optimisation.",

        "abstract": "Solid-state switch is one of the key components of hybrid DC circuit breaker (HDCCB). This paper proposed a bidirectional solid-state switch which is composed of series-connected IGBTs and diode bridges. The solid-state switch has the advantages of low cost, low stray inductance and high turn-off capability, which forms an 160kV/9kA HDCCB together with ultra-fast mechanical switches (MS) and a current commutation drive circuit (CCDC). In this paper, the characteristics of press-pack IGBT, IEGT and IGCT are compared. The turn-off tests of IGBT and IEGT at over 10kA are held. A novel switching module (SM) based on IGBT, diode bridge and external snubber circuits is proposed in order to achieve bidirectional switching with low costs. The series-connected SMs are mounted in a special clamp assembly with high accuracy and uniform pressure distribution. The stray inductance, mechanical property and thermal resistance of the assembly are analyzed. A prototype of the HDCCB demonstrated a successful current interruption within 3 ms at 68.5 kV and 7.2 kA, which verifies the performance of the HDCCB.",

        "abstract": "Different from the continuous-switching behavior of series power electronic devices in converters, the single-switching attribute of dc circuit breakers (DCBs) provides opportunities to integrate metal oxide varistors (MOVs), balancing circuits, and series power devices. This paper proposes a modular design methodology based on discrete MOVs of a DCB with series power electronic devices. The modular dc circuit breaker (MDCB) topology and voltage balance issues, the steep front effect and solution, and the design method are proposed and analyzed in this paper. Compared with the traditional DCB, the MDCB has a self-balancing ability, thereby removing the voltage-balancing circuit and reducing the number of series modules. The standard designed cell can be operated as an independent DCB or compose a high-voltage DCB in series flexibly, which decreases the difficulty of design and commission. Finally, a series experimental platform based on an insulated-gate commutated thyristor, an insulated-gate bipolar transistor, and an injection-enhanced gate transistor is built to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed design methodology.",

Celecoxib and curcumol are two highly hydrophobic drugs which show bioavailability problems due to their poor aqueous solubility. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of celecoxib and curcumol alone and in combination on cell proliferation, invasion, migration, cell cycle and apoptosis induction in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells using  and  experiments. Our data showed that the sensitivity of a combined therapy using low concentration of celecoxib and curcumol was higher than that of celecoxib or curcumol alone. Suppression of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, activation of caspase-9/caspase-3, cell cycle G1 arrest, and inhibition of survival MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway contributed to the synergistic effects of this combination therapy for induction of apoptosis. Additionally, either celecoxib alone or in combination with curcumol inhibited NSCLC cell migration and invasion by suppressing FAK and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activities. Furthermore, the combined treatment reduced tumor volume and weight in xenograft mouse model, and significantly decreased tumor metastasis nodules in lung tissues by tail vein injection. Our results confirm and provide mechanistic insights into the prominent anti-proliferative activities of celecoxib and/or curcumol on NSCLC cells, which provide a rationale for further detailed preclinical and potentially clinical studies of this combination for the therapy of lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "FADD, a classical apoptotic signaling adaptor, was recently reported to have non-apoptotic functions. Here, we report the discovery that FADD regulates lipid metabolism. PPAR-\u03b1 is a dietary lipid sensor, whose activation results in hypolipidemic effects. We show that FADD interacts with RIP140, which is a corepressor for PPAR-\u03b1, and FADD phosphorylation-mimic mutation (FADD-D) or FADD deficiency abolishes RIP140-mediated transcriptional repression, leading to the activation of PPAR-\u03b1. FADD-D-mutant mice exhibit significantly decreased adipose tissue mass and triglyceride accumulation. Also, they exhibit increased energy expenditure with enhanced fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes due to the activation of PPAR-\u03b1. Similar metabolic phenotypes, such as reduced fat formation, insulin resistance, and resistance to HFD-induced obesity, are shown in adipose-specific FADD knockout mice. Additionally, FADD-D mutation can reverse the severe genetic obesity phenotype of ob/ob mice, with elevated fatty acid oxidation and oxygen consumption in adipose tissue, improved insulin resistance, and decreased triglyceride storage. We conclude that FADD is a master regulator of glucose and fat metabolism with potential applications for treatment of insulin resistance and obesity.",

Powder second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements using 1064 nm radiation revealed a moderate efficiency, 0.8 \u00d7 KDP. Additional particle size vs SHG efficiency measurements indicate that K3B3O4(OH)4\u00b72H2O is type I phase-matchable.

        "abstract": "High-speed ultrasonic vibration cutting (HUVC) applies an ultrasonic vibration to a cutting tool transverse to the cutting direction. The advantage of this method is that the high-speed cutting exceeds the critical cutting speed restrictions of ultrasonic vibration cutting. However, irregular dimple arrays are machined on the work-piece surface, increasing the surface roughness. In this paper, a phase shift control method is proposed, which aims to overlap dimples in a regular pattern to decrease the surface roughness for HUVC. First, this paper investigates the theory of phase shift control to guarantee the surface quality of HUVC. Then, a closed-loop direct digital synthesis (DDS) system is designed to keep the phase shift of the machined dimples stable and controllable. A contrast experiment is conducted to compare the performance of the closed-loop DDS and the open-loop DDS methods in HUVC process. The results show that the closed-loop DDS method can render the dimple phase stable and controllable during the HUVC process. The phase shift value influences the surface roughness. Setting the phase shift to 0.94\u03c0 with an appropriate feed-rate, the surface roughness is reduced to 0.303, compared to a surface roughness of 0.785 when using the open-loop DDS method.",

        "abstract": "High-speed ultrasonic vibration cutting (HUVC) has been proven to be significantly effective when turning Ti-6Al-4V alloy in recent researches. Despite of breaking through the cutting speed restriction of the ultrasonic vibration cutting (UVC) method, HUVC can also achieve the reduction of cutting force and the improvements in surface quality and cutting efficiency in the high-speed machining field. These benefits all result from the separation effect that occurs during the HUVC process. Despite the fact that the influences of vibration and cutting parameters have been discussed in previous researches, the separation analysis of HUVC should be conducted in detail in real cutting situations, and the tool geometry parameters should also be considered. In this paper, three situations are investigated in details: (1) cutting without negative transient clearance angle and without tool wear, (2) cutting with negative transient clearance angle and without tool wear, and (3) cutting with tool wear. And then, complete separation state, partial separation state and continuous cutting state are deduced according to real cutting processes. All the analysis about the above situations demonstrate that the tool-workpiece separation will take place only if appropriate cutting parameters, vibration parameters, and tool geometry parameters are set up. The best separation effect was obtained with a low feedrate and a phase shift approaching 180 degrees. Moreover, flank face interference resulted from the negative transient clearance angle and tool wear contributes to an improved separation effect that makes the workpiece and tool separate even at zero phase shift. Finally, axial and radial transient cutting force are firstly obtained to verify the separation effect of HUVC, and the cutting chips are collected to weigh the influence of flank face interference.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   For a series of unique properties, titanium alloy has been widely applied in aviation and aerospace fields. However, the poor machinability makes high-speed machining titanium alloy hardly perform as expected even with advanced tool materials due to the high cutting temperature. Intermittent cutting could be an effective method to decrease the cutting temperature and improve the cutting performance. As typical intermittent cutting methods, traditional ultrasonic vibration cutting (UVC) and elliptical ultrasonic vibration cutting (EUVC) have achieved significant advancements. However, the critical cutting speed confines them to the field of low speed machining. This article proposed a new type of ultrasonic vibration cutting, i.e. high-speed ultrasonic vibration cutting (HUVC), in which the vibration is always along with the feed direction. The separation of the tool and workpiece can be realized under some certain conditions although the cutting speed exceeds far away from the critical speed of the traditional UVC and EUVC methods. As a consequence, it realized high speed cutting on a macro level and intermittent cutting in the micro, and improved the machinability of titanium alloy. Firstly, a theoretical model of HUVC process was established and both of the separation criteria and the duty cycle of HUVC were fully analyzed. Then the feasibility of HUVC method for cutting Ti-6Al-4\u00a0V was verified experimentally compared with conventional cutting (CC) and traditional ultrasonic vibration cutting (UVC). The results demonstrated that tool life in HUVC were extended by 300% in an optimal situation due to the significantly tool wear reduction. Besides, the cutting efficiency increased by 90% compared with CC method obviously. Furthermore, significant cutting force reduction about 50% and better surface roughness improvement in a successive cutting process were also achieved.",

Compared with the traditional cutting force measurement methods, it can realize the measurement of the transient cutting force signal of around 20\u202fKHz rather than the average cutting force. A piezoelectric force sensor of a resonant frequency around 180\u202fKHz is used instead of the traditional dynamometers that only can measure the cutting force signal of no more than 500\u202fHz. Besides, a clamp circuit is used to stabilize the decayed repetitive impulse signal due to the characteristic of piezoelectric sensors. After building the measurement system, experiments and finite element simulations are carried out based on an orthogonal one-directional ultrasonic vibration cutting model, respectively. The results have validated this proposed measurement system through force signal shapes, values of duty cycle and average cutting forces. In this regard, the separation effect of ultrasonic vibration cutting is firstly detected and the cutting process during one vibration cycle can be monitored through the measured transient cutting force signal, both of which will be great significant to the further researches for the deeper understanding of the machining mechanism influenced by the ultrasonic vibration.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is vitally important for most plant processes. However, the P available to plants is present in the soil in the form of inorganic phosphate (Pi), and is often present in only limited amounts. Water stress further reduces Pi availability. Previous studies have highlighted the important roles of members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 1 (PHT1) family and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations for Pi acquisition by plants growing in various environments. In order to understand the Pi uptake of Lycium barbarumL., a drought-tolerant ligneous species belonging to the Solanaceae family, we cloned and characterized six L. barbarum genes encoding transporter proteins belonging to the PHT1 family, and investigated their transcriptional response to AM associations and water stress. The six cloned PHT1 genes of L. barbarum had a similar evolutionary history to that of PHT1 genes found in other Solanaceae species. Three of these genes (LbPT3, LbPT4 and LbPT5) were AM-induced; the other three genes (LbPT1, LbPT2 and LbPT7) played distinct roles in Pi acquisition, translocation and remobilization in roots and leaves. AM-induced PHT1 genes maintained their function under water stress, while moderate and severe water stress upregulated non-AM-induced PHT1 genes in roots and leaves, respectively. Moreover, although LbPT1 was upregulated in AM roots under water stress, LbPT2 and LbPT7 were inhibited in AM roots, which suggested that an AM association satisfied the demand for Pi in roots under water stress and that LbPT1 may play a role in translocating Pi from roots to shoots in this situation.",

        "abstract": "In the first stage of pulp bleaching, the quantity of added chemicals (ClO2 and/or Cl2) is commonly controlled by kappa factor, based on a kappa number online analyzer together with a compensated brightness control scheme as a feedback strategy. However, a kappa number analyzer is not always available, so the bleaching quality relies heavily on the chemical dosage set-point chosen by the operators. In this study, an improved model for the chlorination stage brightness optimization was proposed, based on brightness and residual chemicals before pulp enters the bleaching tower. Additionally, the experience of operators of (C95/D5) bleaching was employed in order to find an optimum chemical dosage set-point quickly. The golden section search algorithm (i.e., \u20180.618 method\u2019) was used to find the optimum chemical dosage in this paper. After applying the proposed method in a pulp mill (C95/D5) bleaching stage, the chlorination stage brightness shifted from 62.9% ISO to the target value 60.7% ISO. Meanwhile, the standard deviation was reduced from 3.0 to 2.5.",

In this paper, soft sensors were used to estimate Canadian Standard Freeness (CSF) and outlet consistency (Cout) after the high consistency refining stage of the alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping (APMP) process. After the secondary variables for modeling that are readily available processed measurements in pre-treatment and the HC refining stage was selected, models based on the case-based reasoning (CBR) method were developed to estimate CSF and Cout. The ability of CBR soft sensors to predict CSF and Cout was tested using data collected from an APMP mill, and the results were satisfactory. Additionally, two typical soft sensor methods that back propagation network (BP) algorithms and support vector regression algorithms (SVR) were employed to predict CSF and Cout and evaluate the performance of the CBR soft sensor. As a result, the proposed soft sensor demonstrated a better performance than the BP method and can be regarded as of comparable quality to the SVR method.",

This paper presents a data-driven approach to estimate the beating degree and wet weight of pulp after refining using case-based reasoning (CBR).

The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variance of the root mean square error (CV-RMSE) of the beating degree estimation results in CBR were 1.30 and 4.32%, respectively, and the RMSE and CV-RMSE of the wet weight were 0.50 and 19.09%, respectively. The results of beating degree prediction were satisfactory, and the results of wet weight were also acceptable. To test the performance of CBR model, support vector machine algorithm (SVM) were employed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy. The RMSE and CV-RMSE of the beating degree estimation results in SVM were 1.20 and 4.02%, respectively, and the RMSE and CV-RMSE of the wet weight were 0.44 and 16.73%, respectively.

The microstructures of TiO 2  films can be feasibly tuned as spheres or nanocrystalline-mixed spheres, rendering in situ preparation of TiO 2  dual-layer. With these dual-layer TiO 2  films as photoanode and N719 as sensitizer, the dye-sensitized solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.96%, which is among the best of N719 devices so far, and constituting up to 19% improvement relative to single-layer TiO 2  photoanode based devices. To disclose the mechanism for the improvement, corresponding samples are prepared and investigated by scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectra. It was found that the dual-layer photoanode can simultaneously incorporate high dye loading and low charge transfer resistance, leading to high short current density and thus high PCE. Different to other reported dual-layer photoanodes, which often need two or more preparing procedures, only one step is needed in this work. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to employ only one step to in situ prepare photoanodes with dual-layer structures, which greatly simplifies the experimental processes.",

A highly sensitive and selective fluorimetric method has been developed to detect Hg2+ ions utilizing R-PE as a fluorescent probe. R-PE could respond selectively to Hg2+ ions among a series of metal ions. The reaction mechanism was investigated through UV-vis, fluorescence microscope imaging and fluorescence measurements. It was demonstrated that the interaction between the R-PE fluorescent probe and Hg2+ ions would cause fluorescence quenching. Besides, there was a linear relationship between R-PE fluorescence intensities and Hg2+ concentrations. A novel method was thus explored to detect Hg2+ ions with high sensitivity, selectivity, and a broad linear range of 0.0010\u201325.0 \u03bcM, which could allow for Hg2+ ions down to 0.0130 \u03bcM with a relative standard deviation of about 1.60%. Additionally, the method was successfully applied to detect Hg2+ ions in diverse water samples, showing the appropriate rates of recovery between 92.0% and 108.0%. This highly sensitive and selective natural green fluorescent probe of R-PE should have huge potential applications for detecting Hg2+ ions in diverse environments.",

Based on experiments, which are conducted at the temperature heated rates of 10, 15 and 20\u202fK\u202fmin \u22121 , the iso-conversional methods of Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa are used to calculate the apparent activation energy. Further, the Avrami theory is used to estimate the apparent reaction order. Apparent thermodynamic parameters of the apparent enthalpy change, apparent Gibbs free energy change and apparent entropy change are calculated. Calculations of apparent kinetic and thermodynamic parameters illustrate that thermal activity of stearic acid is distinctly heightened after esterification and the derived derivants are more easily activated. Meanwhile, influences of alcohol type on esterification products are weak. Conclusions from this study make more comprehensive understanding of the thermal events of biodiesel to be favor for its commercial application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Herein, low Ag doping MnFe 2 O 4  (Ag  x  Mn 1  \u2212   x  Fe 2 O 4 ) was synthesized by an easy sol\u2013gel process and applied for anti-bacteria in the water. Without any special light irradiation, it was found that Ag 0.01 Mn 0.99 Fe 2 O 4  (AMFO-0.01) significantly enhanced the antimicrobial activity by a simple contact with the bacteria. The antimicrobial performances under different AMFO-0.01 dosages, initial bacteria concentrations, temperature and pH were conducted. A good stability was still possessed for AMFO-0.01 after an ultrasonic washing. It was uncovered that the interaction between AMFO-0.01 and cell membrane could restrict the activities of bacteria to cause severe membrane injury. The antimicrobial efficiency was not due to the toxicity of elemental Ag or dissolved metal ions. The doping Ag existed as monovalence ions inside the crystal lattice. Continuous electron transfer of Ag(0)/Ag(I) accelerated the electron delivery of Mn(II)/Mn(III), Fe(II)/Fe(III). Such synergistic effect of Ag, Mn, Fe on the surface induced the generation of reactive species (\u00b7OH, O 2  \u00b7\u2212 , H 2 O 2 ,  1 O 2 ) for the death of bacteria. Considering such easy magnetic separation, room light condition, and high antimicrobial activity of AMFO-0.01, it is a promising candidate in the disinfection application for drinking or waste water treatment.",
