These materials were not mutagenic to any of the tested bacterial strains and did not induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured mammalian cells. The PVP/fullerenes did not exhibit cytotoxicity under ultraviolet or sham irradiation in the alternative phototoxicity test. Moreover, they did not show any pro-oxidant effect in the presence of Fe(2+) or Cu(2+). Thus, we concluded that PVP/fullerenes are safe for use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.

The pyrrolidinium fullerene derivative showed cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells. The characteristics of apoptosis, such as DNA fragmentation and condensation of chromatin in HL-60 cells, were observed by exposure to the pyrrolidinium fullerene derivative. Caspase-3 and -8 were activated and cytochrome c was also released from mitochondria. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the pyrrolidinium fullerene derivative was observed by DCFH-DA, a fluorescence probe for the detection of ROS. Pre-treatment with alpha-tocopherol suppressed cell death and intracellular oxidative stress caused by the pyrrolidinium fullerene derivative. The apoptotic cell death induced by the pyrrolidinium fullerene derivative was suggested to be mediated by ROS generated by the pyrrolidinium fullerene derivative.",

The derivatives 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced cell death and intracellular oxidative stress more significantly than ascorbic acid. Since 2,2'-pyridoins are oxidized to the diketones, 2,2'-pyridils, in a protic solvent, the antioxidant activity of 2,2'-pyridils was also investigated. 2,2'-Pyridils showed antioxidant activity in the cell; however, the activity was lower than that of 2,2'-pyridoins. These results suggested that 2,2'-pyrdoin derivatives can be good cytoprotective agents against oxidative stress.",

The antioxidant activity of 1 and its synthetic derivatives 2 - 7 was evaluated by DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical) scavenging assay and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. In the DPPH assay, 1 exhibited an activity stronger than that of ascorbic acid, and 5,5\u2032-dimethyl-( 5 ) or 5,5\u2032-dimethoxy-substituted derivatives ( 6 ) exhibited more potent activity than 1 . The DPPH scavenging activities of \u03b1-pyridoins were correlated with their oxidation potential and thus the electron density of enediol. 5 and 6 effectively inhibited lipid peroxidation in the rat liver microsome/ tert -butyl hydroperoxide system. Therefore, 5 and 6 serve as good candidates for a pharmacologically useful enediol antioxidant.",

Our previous study revealed that 5-hydroxyoxindole and its 3-phenacyl-3-hydroxy derivatives showed excellent antioxidant activities such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and lipid-peroxidation inhibitory activity. However, the DPPH radical scavenging activity of the 3,3-disubstituted derivatives was lower than that of the original 5-hydroxyoxindole. In the present study, we synthesized novel 3-monosubstituted 5-hydroxyoxindole derivatives that exhibited stronger DPPH radical scavenging activities and lipid peroxidation-inhibitory activities than the 3,3-disubstituted 5-hydroxyoxindoles. Moreover, the 3-monosubstituted 5-hydroxyoxindole derivatives showed neither an iron-mediated pro-oxidant effect nor a remarkable cytotoxicity against HL-60 cell lines except some of the highly lipophilic compounds. These results indicate that 3-monosubstituted 5-hydroxyoxindoles can be used as a promising antioxidant scaffold for drug discovery.",

We have recently shown that chronic METH enhanced METH challenge-induced increase in 5-HT levels in the prefrontal cortex and that 5-HT(1A) receptor activation attenuated this neurochemical sensitization as well as behavioral sensitization. This study examined whether the nonselective 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist, ritanserin affects METH-induced behavioral and neurochemical sensitization in mice. Ritanserin at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg inhibited the development and expression of METH-induced behavioral sensitization in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, chronic administration of ritanserin for a week attenuated the maintenance of behavioral sensitization, indicating the improvement of established behavioral sensitization. Microdialysis analysis showed that chronic ritanserin inhibited the neurochemical sensitization that chronic METH enhanced METH challenge-induced increase in extracellular 5-HT levels in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, acute ritanserin inhibited METH challenge-induced increase in extracellular 5-HT but not DA levels in the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that 5-HT(2) receptors are involved in METH-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization in mice.",

The present study examined the role of serotonin (5-HT)1A receptors in risperidone-induced increases in acetylcholine release in rat prefrontal cortex. Systemic administration of risperidone at doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg increased acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex in a dose-dependent manner. This increase was antagonized by systemic administration of high doses (1 and 3 mg/kg) of N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY100635), a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist/dopamine D4 receptor agonist, but not by a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) of the antagonist which antagonizes preferentially presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Furthermore, local application of WAY100635 into the prefrontal cortex also attenuated risperidone-induced increases in acetylcholine release. WAY100635 alone did not affect acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex. On the other hand, local application of risperidone (3 and 10 microM), the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (1 and 10 microM), and the dopamine D4 receptor antagonist 3-(4-(4-iodophenyl)piperazine-1-yl)methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine (1 and 10 microM) into the cortex did not affect acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that risperidone increases acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex through a complex mechanism which is enhanced by prefrontal 5-HT1A receptor activation.",

The present study examined the effects of anxiolytic or anxiogenic agents and isolation rearing on the behavior of ddY (outbred) strain mice in the staircase test. Diazepam and phenobarbital increased the number of steps climbed, but did not affect rearing behavior in group-reared mice. FG-7142, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, significantly increased the number of rearing with no changes in the number of steps climbed in group-reared mice. Methamphetamine increased the number of steps climbed and decreased the number of rearing in group-reared mice. Although isolation-reared mice showed hyperactivity, there was no difference in locomotor activity for the test period of 3 min between isolation- and group-reared mice. Under these conditions, isolation rearing increased the numbers of steps climbed and rearing compared to group-reared controls. Microanalysis of locomotor patterns of group-reared mice in the staircase test showed that anxiolytic drugs increased the number of climbing to the top step of the staircase and methamphetamine increased the number of climbing to the first to third step. These results suggest that isolation rearing causes an anxiety-like state with increased exploratory behavior in mice.",

This study examined whether edaravone, a radical scavenger, protects against methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in mice. Methamphetamine treatment (4 mg/kg, s.c. x 4 with 2 h intervals) showed striatal dopaminergic degeneration as observed by decreases in dopamine levels and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the striatum. The neurotoxicity was reduced by edaravone (3 mg/kg, i.p.), when it was administered four times 30 min before methamphetamine at 2 h intervals and additionally four times after methamphetamine at 12 h intervals. An immunohistochemical study showed that methamphetamine increased 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity, an in vivo marker of peroxynitrite production, and activated microglia and astrocytes in the striatum. Edaravone blocked the increase in 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity and the activation of astrocytes, but it did not affect the activation of microglia. Edaravone did not affect methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia and striatal dopamine release. These results suggest that edaravone protects against methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in the striatum by blocking peroxynitrite production. This study also suggests that methamphetamine activates microglia in a radical-independent mechanism.",

Previous studies using serotonin (5-HT) receptor ligands show that the 5-HT system is involved in cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization in rats, but the role of the 5-HT system has not been studied in mice. The present study examined the effects of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist osemozotan, the 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist ritanserin and the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist azasetron on cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization in male ddY mice. Repeated administration of cocaine for 7 days enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity, and this sensitization was observed even after withdrawal for 7-14 days. Cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization after a 7-day withdrawal was significantly reduced with the coadministration of osemozotan, ritanserin or azasetron with cocaine repeatedly for 7 days. A single injection of osemozotan or ritanserin before cocaine challenge also reduced repeated cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. However, none of these ligands inhibited cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization, when each drug was administered for 7 days after repeated cocaine administration. These results suggest that the central 5-HT system plays a role in the development and expression, but not maintenance, of behavioral sensitization in cocaine-treated mice.",

        "abstract": "Coadministration of atypical antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) enhances the release of monoamines such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) in the prefrontal cortex. To clarify the role of DA-D2/3 receptors in the combination effect, we examined the effects of coadministration of the selective DA-D2/3 antagonist sulpiride and the SSRI fluvoxamine on amine neurotransmitter release in rat prefrontal cortex. Sulpiride (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and fluvoxamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) alone did not affect extracellular DA levels, while their coadministration caused a significant increase in DA levels. Sulpiride alone did not affect extracellular levels of 5-HT and NE in the prefrontal cortex, while fluvoxamine alone caused a marked increase in 5-HT levels and a slight increase in NE levels. Sulpiride did not affect the fluvoxamine-induced increases in extracellular levels of 5-HT and NE. The DA-D2/3 antagonist haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) in combination with fluvoxamine also caused a selective increase in extracellular DA levels in the cortex. Coadministration of sulpiride and fluvoxamine did not affect extracellular DA levels in the striatum. Combination of systemic sulpiride and local fluvoxamine did not increase the DA levels, but that of systemic fluvoxamine with local sulpiride increased. The combination effect in increasing prefrontal DA levels was antagonized systemically, but not locally, by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 at a low dose. These findings suggest that the combination of prefrontal DA-D2/3 receptor blockade and 5-HT1A receptor activation in regions other than the cortex plays an important role in sulpiride and fluvoxamine-induced increase in prefrontal DA release.",

Previous studies show that 5-HT1A receptor agonist and antagonist modify the cocaine-induced behavioral and neurochemical effects in the rats. However, the role of the 5-HT system on the effects of cocaine has not been studied in the prefrontal cortex. The present study examined in ddY-strain male mice the effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist osemozotan and the receptor antagonist WAY100635 on cocaine-induced locomotor stimulant effect and increases in extracellular levels of 5-HT and DA in the prefrontal cortex. The cocaine-induced locomotor stimulant effect was attenuated by osemozotan and enhanced by WAY100635. The cocaine-induced increase in extracellular levels of 5-HT was attenuated by osemozotan, and enhanced by WAY100635. The cocaine-induced increase in extracellular levels of DA was enhanced by osemozotan, but not affected by WAY100635. These results suggest that the prefrontal 5-HT system plays a pivotal role in the locomotor stimulant effect of cocaine in mice.",

Repeated administration of METH for 7 days enhanced METH challenge-induced locomotor activity, and this sensitization was observed even after its withdrawal for 7-14 days. Administration of osemozotan to METH-sensitized mice inhibited the maintenance of behavioral sensitization. This effect was blocked by a low dose of WAY100635, a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. A METH challenge increased the extracellular levels of dopamine (DA), 5-HT, and noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex, but only the increase in 5-HT release was enhanced by repeated METH administration. This augmented response of 5-HT release was attenuated by osemozotan in a WAY100635-sensitive way. A single administration of osemozotan to drug na\u00efve mice inhibited METH-induced locomotor stimulant effect and reduced METH-induced increase in prefrontal 5-HT, but not DA, release. These results suggest that prefrontal 5-HT release is involved at least partly in the effects of osemozotan on single and repeated METH-induced behavioral effects in mice, and imply that the 5-HT1A receptors may have a potential therapeutic value in the remission of schizophrenia.",

This study examined the effects of coadministration of these drugs on duration of immobility in the tail suspension test using mice. Neither sulpiride (3 or 10 mg/kg) nor fluvoxamine (10 or 20 mg/kg) alone affected immobility time, whereas coadministration significantly reduced immobility time. WAY 100635, a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, did not affect the effects of sulpiride and fluvoxamine coadministration, but reduced immobility time in combination with fluvoxamine (20 mg/kg). A high dose of fluvoxamine alone (60 mg/kg) also reduced immobility time. These results suggest that the antidepressant-like effects of fluvoxamine in combination with sulpiride or WAY 100635 in the tail suspension test are mediated by the activation of dopamine or 5-HT systems, respectively.",

Central dopamine (DA) neurons play key roles as the neural substrates mediating behavioral sensitization, but the role of the serotonin (5-HT) system in the sensitization is not fully elucidated. We have recently demonstrated that osemozotan, a specific 5-HT(1A)-receptor agonist, and ritanserin, a 5-HT(2)-receptor antagonist, inhibited the expression and development of both methamphetamine- and cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization in mice and that these drugs attenuated the maintenance of behavioral sensitization of methamphetamine, but not that of cocaine. We also found that azasetron, a 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist, inhibited the expression and development of the sensitization induced by methamphetamine and cocaine, respectively. Neurochemical studies using a microdialysis technique showed that repeated methamphetamine enhanced the methamphetamine-induced increase in 5-HT release in the prefrontal cortex. The sensitization of 5-HT release in methamphetamine-treated mice was attenuated by osemozotan and ritanserin. These findings suggest that the 5-HT system plays an important role in methamphetamine- and cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization in mice and imply that 5-HT(1A)-receptor agonists and 5-HT(2)-receptor antagonists may have a potential therapeutic value for the treatment of methamphetamine abuse or psychosis.",

Risperidone and clozapine significantly increased the release of acetylcholine but sulpiride did not, and fluvoxamine did not enhance the effects of the antipsychotics.

(3) Time is required to attain a steady state of heating from the non-steady state of heating caused by transition. This time constant depends on the type of apparatus. The time constant affects the extrapolated end temperature of melting of polymers having a sharp peak. (4) The differences in the scattering of the data reported by each participant is fairly large.

The effects of the ratio of ester groups to epoxide groups ( r ) in the reaction mixture on the glass transition temperature ( T g ) and the thermal stability of the cured resins were also examined by thermomechanical analysis and thermogravimetry respectively. The T g has the maximum value of 72\u00b0C at r = 1 for either TAB or TPCP as curing agent. The thermal stability increases with increasing value of r .",

        "abstract": "The reproducibility of transition temperatures (melting, crystallization and glass transition temperatures) of polymers determined by thermal analysis was examined by a round robin method, in which twenty three laboratories participated. Seven polymer samples were used for the test, which consisted of polyethylene pellet and film, two poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers, poly(ether ether ketone) pellet, polystyrene sheet and poly(ether sulfone) pellet. Eight types of instrument were employed including 13 power-compensated type differential scanning calorimeters and 8 heat-flux type ones (quantitative differential thermal analyzers). For the first-order transition such as melting and crystallization, the values of the peak melting and crystallization temperatures ( T pm and T pc ) and the extrapolated onset and end temperatures ( T im and T ic , and T em and T ec ) agreed well among laboratories. The standard deviations (\u03c3 n ) were smaller than 3.0 K for T pm , T pc , T im and T em , and T ic and T ec with a few exceptions. However, the onset and end temperatures ( T' im and T' em , and T' ic and T' ec ) are so scattered that it is reasonable to use T pm , and T pc , and T im , and T em , and T ic and T ec for the comparison of data obtained for polymers by thermal analysis in separate laboratories. For glass transition, the \u03c3 n values were within 3.1 K for the extrapolated onset temperature ( T ig ) and the midpoint temperatures ( T mg ), but the onset and end temperatures ( T' ig and T' eg ) and the extrapolated end temperature ( T eg ) were very scattered. Therefore, it is appropriate to use T ig and T mg to compare the data from different sources.",

Examination of the time course of the reaction in toluene showed that the dibromoalloside was initially formed and was converted into the dibromoglucoside during the bromination. The rate constants of the interconversion between the dibromoglycosides in LiBr- N , N -dimethylacetamide (DMA) were about 10 3 times as large as those of the interconversion of the corresponding dichloroglycosides in LiCl-DMA.

Methyl 3,6-dichloro-3,6-dideoxy-\u03b2- d -glucoside was formed; the reaction was reversible and the equilibrium was on the glucoside side. GLC analysis of the hydrolyzates of chlorodeoxycellulose samples after treatment with LiCl showed that the dichloroallose units were partly converted into 3,6-dichloro-3,6-dideoxy- d -glucose units. A kinetic study showed that the rate of conversion of the dichloroallose unit into the dichloroglucose unit was lower than that of the dichloroalloside into the dichloroglucoside, and the amounts of the two units at equilibrium were calculated to be close to each other. Based on the values of the kinetic parameters obtained, the conversion of the dichloroallose units into the dichloroglucose units during the chlorination of cellulose in LiCl-DMA was estimated to be negligibly small under typical reaction conditions.",

The thermal degradation of Polyformal II occurs in two stages, whereas that of Polyformal I occurs in a single stage. The major products of thermal decomposition of Polyformal I are \u03b1-methylstyrene, phenol, 4-hydroxy-\u03b1-methylstyrene, isopropyl phenol, and 4-isopropenyl anisole, whereas those of Polyformal II are pentafluoroisopropenyl benzene and pentafluoroisopropenyl anisole. The two-step decrease in weight of Polyformal II by thermal degradation is not caused by the different reactions, but results from the different vapor pressures, that is, the different rates of vaporization between the decomposition products, more volatile pentafluoroisopropenyl benzene and less volatile pentafluoroisopropenyl anisole.",

In the course of the evaporation of water from liquid silk, silk fibroin crystallizes when weight loss of water reaches 40% at the temperatures below 120\u00b0C. The crystallization occurs 20 min after the specimens are put at above 100\u00b0C and 1\u20133 h at below 100\u00b0C. In the DSC curve of liquid silk of domestic silk Bombyx mori , the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 transition occurs at 51\u00b0C. The crystallization temperatures of wild silk Antheraea yamamai , Antheraea pernyi and Dictyoploa japonica are 59, 67 and 62.5\u00b0C, respectively. The exothermic DSC peaks at these temperatures are attributed to the conformational change to the \u03b2-form. Keywords Silk fibroin DSC Crystallization \u03b1- to \u03b2-form transition Wild silk",

Hydrolysis of the pendant benzamido groups of the resulting polymer was successfully achieved in aqueous ethanol containing concentrated hydrochloric acid at 100\u00b0C to give N-amino-l-nylon (3). The original polymer dissolves easily in aliphatic and aromatic alcohols and polar aprotic solvents, whereas the hydrolyzed polymer is not soluble in these solvents but highly soluble in water. In dilute aqueous solutions, the latter polymer behaves as common polyelectrolytes with flexible backbone. Polymers 2 and 3 began to lose weight in air at around 200 and 170\u00b0C, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Transgenic tobacco plants that overproduce luciferase (Luc) frequently exhibit post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of luc. The silencing was observed over five generations and found not to be inherited but acquired by the next generation at a certain frequency. Luc imaging analysis of silenced plants revealed Luc activity only in proliferating tissues such as shoot meristem and developing flower. The luc gene expression has been recovered from silencing before development of germ cells, excluding a possible recovery from the PTGS at meiosis. A systemic silencing signal transferred from older tissue likely induces gene silencing of younger tissues in which cell proliferation has been completed. Only seeds maintained Luc activity, probably because of isolation from the silencing signal by a possible partition from the parent placenta. Calli newly induced from the leaf pieces of silenced plants recovered from the silencing and exhibited strong Luc activity similar to nonsilenced leaves, further indicating that the silencing cannot be maintained in proliferating cells. Thus release from PTGS in proliferating cells is a possible mechanism for noninheritance of silencing.",

In transgenic tobacco calli, promoters of MDV C4 (encoding a cell-cycle link protein), C5 and C7 (both encoding unknown proteins), C6 (encoding a nuclear-shuttle protein) and C8 (encoding a movement protein) generated a stronger level of GUS expression than the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter (P35S). In leaves of transgenic tobacco plants, the promoters of C5 and C8 conferred a level of GUS activity comparable to that of P35S. Histochemical GUS analysis showed that the promoters of C4-C9, the latter encoding a capsid protein, were active in phloem and meristematic tissue. The promoter of C8 was also active in mesophyll and cortex cell types. A low level of activity was found for the promoters of C11, which encodes a master replication-initiator protein (Rep), and C1, C2, C3 and C10, which encode additional Reps, in both transgenic tobacco calli and plants.",

When the GUS fusion gene was introduced into tobacco, PMC8 showed a similar expression profile to P35S but with a more intense expression in proliferating tissues. The usefulness of PMC8 was confirmed by driving NPTII for selection of kanamycin-resistant tobacco plants with improved transformation efficiency. PMC8 was also effective in transgenic rice plants. Thus, PMC8 is useful as an alternative to P35S in both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants, especially for gene expression in proliferating tissues.",

        "abstract": "The active-head slider technology for hard disk drive is one of the most promising means to decrease flying height. This paper describes a piezoelectric flying height control slider which has a faster dynamic response compared with conventional active-head sliders. This slider can be also adapted to the conventional slider-fabrication process. PZT layer located near the magnetic head has shear mode deformation by applying electric voltage between the upper and lower electrodes when the flying height of magnetic head needs to be decreased or increased. We fabricated a prototype with single crystal Si substrate for feasibility study. Our evaluation of the prototype revealed that the piezoelectric constant of the shear mode deformation was 0.88\u00a0nm/V, and the dynamic response was 50\u00a0kHz. The shape of the air bearing surface was optimized by simulations using a robust design method. We found that the stroke was 8\u00a0nm for an applied voltage of 11\u00a0V if the flying height was 11\u00a0nm with no deformation in PZT.",

        "title": "Design of swing arm type actuators considering thermal and dynamic characteristics",
        "abstract": "The present state of the design of swing arm actuators for optical disc drives is to obtain the highly efficient dynamic characteristics within a very compact volume. As a necessary consequence, the need of the small form factor (SFF) storage device has arisen as a major interest in the information storage technology. Due to the size constraint, the thermal stability of the optical pick-up head is important: therefore, the actuator is designed to emit the heat, which is generated by the optical pick-up, along the structural body easily. In this paper, we suggest the miniaturized swing arm type actuator that has effective heat emission quality as well as satisfies the dynamic requirements for the SFF optical disk drive (ODD). The actuator is targeted to be installed in CF-II card size drive to be competitive with flash memory or mini hard disk drive used in mobile electric devices; therefore the dimension of the actuator is required as 11.0\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025.0\u00a0mm (width\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0height\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0length). Because of its small size, the dynamic requirements are severe to ensure the enough gain-margin for the system control together with satisfying the DC/AC sensitivity conditions. Moreover, due to the small size, the maximum pick-up temperature is critical in design because the system has high possibility to reach the shut-down temperature. For the operating mechanism, it uses a tracking electromagnetic (EM) circuit for the focusing motion together and the initial model is designed and promoted by the design of experiments (DOE) only considering the dynamic characteristics. New concept design is suggested based on the topology optimization method considering the thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the new design is modified by DOE to maintain the high sensitivity and to have wide control bandwidth and decreasing mass and inertia. The final design of a swing arm type actuator for SFF ODD is suggested and its dynamic characteristics are verified.",

Small optical disk drives could provide a good solution, because their storage media is cheaper than those of hard disk drives or flash memories. In this paper, we proposed the miniaturized swing arm type actuator that had a new focusing mechanism for small and slim optical disk drives (ODD). Initial model was designed by EM and structural analyses. Based on results of DOE, optimization procedures of EM circuits were performed with design variables using variable metric method (VMM).

Finally, the swing arm type actuator for small and slim ODDs was suggested and its dynamic characteristics were checked.",

An optical near-field transducer (NFT) and a waveguide are near the write-pole in the head slider. During the HAMR process, current is applied to an LD, and the laser beam is coupled into the waveguide and delivered to the NFT. The NFT further concentrate the focused optical spot and the optical spot locally heats the recording medium, thereby reducing the media coercivity. The temperature of the LD and the slider, however, increases. The slider is, moreover, locally deformed, and the flying-height (FH) changes. Therefore, an experimental set-up to simultaneously evaluate the FH change and LD temperature of the HAMR-HGA was required to develop the HAMR technology. We developed a novel experimental set-up for simultaneously evaluating laser characteristics (power, voltage, and wavelength), the increase in LD temperature, and the FH change of a HAMR-HGA. By using this set-up to measure these characteristics of our prototype, the HAMR-HGA showed that the FH decreased as the LD temperature increased. The LD temperature is directly related to the laser characteristics. The change in laser characteristics affects the read-write performance of HAMR. The FH change also affects the performance. Therefore, the developed experimental set-up should be useful in improving HAMR-HGA.",

        "abstract": "Androgen plays an important role in the developing ovaries of female fish. However, little is known regarding either the sites of production of androgen or its functional roles. In the present study, we investigated immunohistochemically the localization of cholesterol-side-chain-cleavage (P450scc) and cytochrome P45011beta-hydroxylase (P45011beta) with antibodies P450scc and P45011beta in the ovary of the female honeycomb grouper Epinephelus merra during its reproductive cycle. Clusters of strongly immunopositive cells, with 100-1000 cells in each cluster, against both P450scc and P45011beta, were observed throughout the annual reproductive cycle in tissue near blood vessels in the tunica ovary surrounding the outer periphery of the ovary. The ultrastructural characteristics of these cells showed that they were steroid-producing cells. In contrast, immunopositive cells against P450scc but not against P45011beta were localized in the theca layer surrounding the outer periphery of oocytes. These results suggest that two distinct steroid biosynthesis sites exist in the ovary and that cells at the two sites differ functionally. The only cells that biosynthesize 11-ketotestosterone are found in clusters in the vicinity of blood vessels; they possibly play a physiological role in oocyte growth and gonadal restructuring during the sex change of individuals of this species.",

        "abstract": "The cardinalfish Siphamia versicolor (Perciformes: Apogonidae) forms a bioluminescent symbiosis with the marine luminous bacterium Photobacterium mandapamensis, harboring the bacteria in a ventral, disc-shaped light organ and using the bacterial light apparently for counterillumination\n and attracting prey. Little definitive information has been available on the developmental and microbiological events surrounding\n the initiation of symbiosis, a critical stage in the life history of the fish, in S.\u00a0versicolor or any of the many other species of bacterially luminous fish. To identify the stage at which light organ formation begins,\n to determine the origin of cells forming the light organ, and to characterize its bacterial colonization status during development,\n early developmental stages of S.\u00a0versicolor obtained and reared from wild-caught mouth-brooding males were examined with histological and microbiological methods. A\n light organ primordium was not evident in embryos, post-embryos, or pre-release larvae, whereas the light organ began to form\n within 1\u00a0day of release of full-term pre-flexion larvae from the mouths of male fish. Analysis of post-release larvae revealed\n that the light organ arises from a proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, and that it quickly develops\n structural complexity, including the formation of chambers and gaps contiguous with the intestinal epithelium. However, the\n nascent light organ remained uncolonized by the symbiotic bacteria through several days of post-release development, even\n in the presence of high numbers of the symbiotic bacteria. These results demonstrate that the inception of light organ formation\n in S.\u00a0versicolor occurs independently of its symbiotic bacteria and that receptivity to bacterial colonization apparently requires substantial\n post-release development of the light organ. Larvae therefore most likely acquire their symbiotic bacteria from seawater,\n during or shortly after the transition from the pre-flexion to the flexion developmental stage.",

For all treatments, fish were acclimatized in particular environmental conditions for 2 or 4 weeks. For fish reared at 18.4, 23 and 28 \u00b0C, the circulating IgM concentration increased with increased water temperature for 2 weeks. Rearing the fish at 33 \u00b0C resulted in a decrease in IgM concentration, suggesting that the fish possess an appropriate thermal range for production of immune substances. Plasma level of IgM increased significantly with salinity at 12 and 24 parts per thousand (ppt). On the other hand, plasma IgM concentration did not change by exposing the fish to acidification (pH 4.0) and suspended solids (20, 200, and 2000 mg/l).

        "abstract": "Golden rabbitfish, Siganus guttatus , do not attain spermiation in the first spawning season after hatching in northern Okinawa, Japan. Nevertheless, underyearling males possess spermatogenic germ cells at the late stages of development, including spermatozoa. The fate of those germ cells is still unknown. This study examined whether prespawning treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) may induce further development and/or maturation of those germ cells in an attempt to obtain expressible milt from underyearling golden rabbitfish. Cholesterol pellets containing three different doses of GnRHa (0 (control), 100 and 200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg \u2212 1 body weight) were implanted intramuscularly in underyearling rabbitfish. The implanted fish were examined 2.5\u00a0months later. At the end of experiment, mean gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly higher in the 200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg \u2212 1 group than in the control group. While the testicular histology of about 40% of the control males showed regression from the initial condition, 70\u201380% of males in both GnRHa-treated groups demonstrated advanced maturation stages, including spermiation. Mean plasma 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and testosterone (T) levels in the GnRHa-treated group were significantly higher than in the control group, while no significant changes were shown in 17\u03b1,20\u03b2-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) levels. In conclusion, GnRHa treatment induced the development and maturation of spermatogenic germ cells, leading to spermiation in underyearling male testes, demonstrating that GnRHa treatment could serve as a useful way to induce precocious spermiation in male golden rabbitfish.

        "abstract": "To clarify the relationship between steroid hormones and sex differentiation of the protandrous anemonefish Amphiprion clarkii, we histologically examined its gonadal differentiation. From hatching to 30 days post hatching (dph), all of the gonads surveyed were sexually undifferentiated. The gonads of all fish first differentiated into ovaries at 60 dph, and the oocytes gradually developed and increased in number as the ovaries grew up until 183 dph. Some cysts of differentiated spermatogenic germ cells appeared in the ovaries at 214 dph, and ambisexual gonads with both ovarian and testicular tissues formed by 273 dph. Using immunohistochemistry, we then investigated the expression of cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), during gonadal sex differentiation. P450scc-immunopositive reactions first appeared in sexually undifferentiated gonads at 30 dph. Beginning at 60 dph, the number of strongly positive cells increased throughout the differentiation of the ovaries and continued to increase during the testicular differentiation until 210 dph. Immunopositive cells were observed more frequently in ovarian tissue than in testicular tissue in the ambisexual gonads at 270 dph. These results suggest that endogenous steroid hormones are important for the sex differentiation, including the primary sex differentiation and subsequent testicular differentiation, of the anemonefish.",

        "abstract": "There are accumulating reports showing that the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a significant effect on the population dynamics of marine fishes. However, the influence of ENSO on the physiology of fishes, as possible components of those ecological changes in fish populations, is not fully understood. This study investigated the cellular, physiological, and organismal stress responses in a wild fish population under natural thermal stress. The sea surface temperature at the subtropical ocean of Okinawa, Japan, was the highest in the last 10 years (>32\u00b0C) during the summer of 1998 with a strong ENSO. To examine the effects of those unusually warm ocean temperatures on fish, we compared tissue 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) levels and growth rates between the ENSO summer of 1998 and the normal summer of 1999 in a common fish species in Okinawa, the Indo-Pacific sergeant, Abudefduf vaigiensis. We also conducted a complementary heat shock experiment in the laboratory. The field collected Indo-Pacific sergeant had significantly higher muscle HSP70 levels in 1998 than 1999. Higher muscle HSP70 and plasma cortisol levels were observed at 32\u00b0C than at 28\u00b0C in the laboratory heat shock experiment, indicating that the highest summer ocean temperature in 1998 was sufficient for the fish to up-regulate the cellular and physiological stress responses. In support of this effect, otoliths showed slower growth rates of the fish during the summer of 1998; this may reflect the significant energetic cost of these stress responses.",

        "abstract": "To study the mechanism of protogynous sex change in honeycomb grouper, the wild fish of both sexes and transitionals were collected for one year, and changes in gonadal structures and serum levels of sex hormones in each individual were examined. The onset of sex change was associated with low serum estradiol - 17\u03b2 (E2)\u00a0levels. In order to clarify whether E2\u00a0deprivation causes sex change, maturing females were implanted with the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (Fadrozole, AI). AI caused complete sex change from female to functional males in two and half months. The present results suggest that E2 is an important endogenous factor which regulates protogynous sex change in the honeycomb grouper.",

        "abstract": "The honeycomb grouper shows protogynous hermaphroditism. The endocrine mechanisms involved in gonadal restructuring throughout protogynous sex change are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated changes in the gonadal structures and levels of serum sex steroid hormones during female to male sex change in the honeycomb grouper. On the basis of histological changes, entire process of sex change was assigned into four developmental phases: female, early transition (ET), late transition (LT), and male phase. At the female phase, the oocytes of several developmental stages were observed including gonial germ cells in the periphery of ovigerous lamellae. At the beginning of ET phase, perinucleolar and previtellogenic oocytes began degenerating, followed by proliferation of spermatogonia toward the center of lamella. The LT phase was characterized by further degeneration of oocytes and rapid proliferation of spermatogenic germ cells throughout the gonad. At the male phase, no ovarian cells were observed and testis had germ cells undergoing active spermatogenesis. Serum levels of estradiol-17beta (E2) were high in females in the breeding season, but low in the non-breeding female, transitional and male phase, and those of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and testosterone (T) were low in females and gradually increased in the transitional and male phase. The present results suggest that low serum E2 levels and degeneration of oocytes accompanied by concomitant increase in the 11-KT levels and proliferation of spermatogenic germ cells are probably the events mediating protogynous sex change in the honeycomb grouper.",

        "abstract": "Many wrasses on coral reefs exhibit daily spawning that peaks around daytime high tides. In this study, we examined tidal-related ovarian development in the threespot wrasse, Halichoeres trimaculatus, a species common on coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. When the fish were collected in the morning at different tidal phases, the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and ovarian histology changed; concomitant with increases in GSI towards high tide, a clutch of the most advanced oocytes developed from vitellogenic to maturation stages. Ovulated eggs and post-ovulated follicles (POF) existed in most ovaries around high tide, but only POF remained around ebb tide, suggesting that spawning occurred during or after high tide. We noticed that tidal-related spawning was considerable in the morning and that most ovaries collected on the afternoon high tide exhibited post-spawning features. This suggests that certain labrid species possess plasticity with regard to their spawning time and utilize potent environmental cues to ensure their reproductive success. When pieces of ovary were incubated with precursor steroids, high conversion of testosterone to 17beta-estradiol occurred during high and ebb tides, while that of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one and 17alpha,20beta,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one was observed during low and flood tides. Incubation of pieces of ovary with human chorionic gonadotropin resulted in similar fluctuations in the steroid hormones with tidal phase. Production of these steroid hormones correlated with oocyte development in the ovaries and was probably regulated by gonadotropin. These results demonstrate that the daily cycle is fundamental for oocyte development, and that the tidal cycle is superimposed on this process.",

        "abstract": "To elucidate the involvement of endogenous estrogen (estradiol-17beta; E2) and the decisive factor (somatic or germinal element) in the ovarian differentiation of tropical marine teleosts, the effect of the aromatase inhibitor (AI) fadrozole on gonadal sex differentiation in the golden rabbitfish Siganus guttatus (Bloch) was examined for different dosages and periods of treatment. Fadrozole interrupted ovarian cavity formation at a dose of 500 microg g(-1) diet, while there was little effect at 10 or 100 microg g(-1). The gonads from both the 30-day and 90-day administration (500 microg g(-1) diet) groups were significantly biased toward testes (P=0.002 and <0.0001, respectively), which suggests strongly that E2 is involved in early ovarian differentiation and that its suppression is an indispensable condition for testicular differentiation in S. guttatus. The results from the two different AI treatment periods imply that the initial feminization of somatic gonadal elements determines subsequent ovarian differentiation, including oogenesis: a conclusion supported by the considerable time lag between ovarian cavity formation and subsequent oogenesis during normal ovarian differentiation in S. guttatus.",

        "abstract": "The presence of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS)-like B-cells in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is rare and its clinicopathological features still remain unclear. Here, we describe 30 cases of PTCL with HRS-like B-cells from Japan. Twenty-three cases (77%) presented evidence of follicular T-helper phenotype (TFH) derivation: 12 were angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and 11 PTCL with TFH phenotype (PTCL-TFH). The remaining seven cases were diagnosed as PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was detected in 25 cases (83%), but HRS-like B-cells were EBER in only 20 cases (67%). The median age at diagnosis was 77 years (range, 39-91 y), including 24 patients (80%) were older than 60 years of age. Most of the patients presented at an advanced clinical stage and were associated with higher risk according to the International Prognostic Index. The 3-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 44% and 27%, respectively. No significant clinicopathological differences were detected between PTCL-TFH, PTCL-NOS and the angioimmunoblastic cases. Cases with EBER HRS-like B-cells were associated with inferior overall and progression-free survival compared to those with EBER HRS-like B-cells, but the difference was not significant. In conclusion, HRS-like B-cells were found in a subset of T-cell lymphomas, especially in association with the TFH phenotype and EBV reactivation. These cells have a tendency to affect elderly patients and to be associated with advanced clinical stages and dismal prognosis. The EBV status of HRS-like B-cells does not seem to affect the clinicopathological features of this group of PTCLs.",

        "abstract": "MUM1/IRF4 expression is detected in 18% to 41% of Burkitt lymphoma (BL). However, only a few studies of MUM1-positive (MUM1) BL have been reported, and its characteristics still remain controversial. To highlight the features of MUM1 BL, we compared the clinicopathologic characteristics of 37 cases of MUM1 and 51 cases of MUM1-negative (MUM1) BL in Japan. Compared with MUM1 BL, patients with MUM1 BL showed significantly younger onset (P=0.0062) and a higher ratio of females (P=0.013). We have also revealed the difference in the involved sites. The MUM1 group showed lower incidences of involvement of stomach (P=0.012) and tonsil (P=0.069). There was a more tendency in MUM1 group to involve colon (P=0.072), breast (P=0.073), and kidney (P=0.073). Regarding the prognosis, a trend toward a lower overall survival for MUM1 group was noted (P=0.089). Notably, comparing MUM1 and MUM1 BL cases of adults (age16 y old and above), the former showed significantly worse prognosis (P=0.041). Among the BL patients treated with the intensive chemotherapy, a standard therapy for BL, MUM1 cases showed worse prognosis (P=0.056). In conclusion, MUM1 BL showed worse prognosis, particularly in adult cases, compared with MUM1 BL. In addition, the difference of the onset age, sex ratio, and involved sites between the 2 groups was noted. Our results demonstrate that MUM1 expression might predict worse prognosis of BL, and MUM1 BL should be distinguished from MUM1 BL.",

        "abstract": "Nodal cytotoxic molecule (CM)-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (CTL) has recently been recognized as a clinicopathologically distinct disease. To further characterize this disease, here we compared 58 patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative CTL to 48 patients with EBV-positive CTL. The two groups did not differ in histopathology, T-cell receptor (TCR) expression or rearrangement incidences, or survival curves. However, patients with EBV-negative CTL less frequently showed hepatic involvement (P = 0.007), B symptoms (P = 0.020), hemophagocytosis (P = 0.024), and detectable CD4 (P = 0.002) and CD5 (P = 0.009). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified three factors that independently predicted favorable survival, onset age <60 years (P = 0.002), CD5 expression (P = 0.002), and mixed morphology (P = 0.013), TCR\u03b1\u03b2 was not an independent predictor (P = 0.30), but was strongly linked with long survivorship among patients younger than 60 years old. A prognostic model incorporating these factors worked well for prognostic delineation, independently of the International Prognostic Index (P = 0.007 vs. P = 0.082) and Prognostic Index for PTCL (P = 0.020 vs. P = 0.15). Moreover, this constellation of findings indicated two nodal indolent diseases: CD5 TCR\u03b1\u03b2 (n = 13), and CD5 NK-cell type lacking TCR expression or clonal TCR\u03b3 rearrangement (n = 4). The survival curves for these two groups were significantly superior to others (n = 29, P < 0.001). These diseases appear to be unique in their indolent clinical behavior, and should be managed differently from other diseases. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Through this case report and literature review, we seek to clarify definitive pathologic features to differentiate these two conditions. A 38-year-old male kidney transplant recipient who had been receiving immunosuppressants was admitted to our hospital with unidentified high fever. Computed tomography images and blood tests indicated a lymphoproliferative disorder. Abdominal lymph node biopsy was performed, and microscopic examination revealed the presence of many large atypical cells in a background of dense T cell accumulation. The large, atypical cells were positive for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-encoded small RNAs (EBER) in situ hybridization, EBV-LMP1, CD30 and PAX5, but negative for CD15, CD20 and CD45. Except for CD15-negativity, this immunohistochemical pattern was consistent with that of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. By close examination of the above immunoreactivities and the patient's subsequent chemosensitive clinical course, we finally made a diagnosis of HL-PTLD.",

        "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of primary gastrointestinal EBV T-cell lymphoma (GITCL) includes enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Type II EATL is considered to be a tumor of intraepithelial lymphocytes. However, the evaluation of intraepithelial lymphocytosis by biopsy specimens is challenging, which poses a diagnostic problem between the EATL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. This situation requested us to establish a pragmatic diagnostic approach for the classification of GITCL. We identified 42 cases of GITCL and analyzed clinicopathologic features, especially addressing their T-cell receptor (TCR) phenotype. Nine (21%) of 42 GITCL cases were positive for TCR\u03b3 protein expression. Among these TCR\u03b3 cases, TCR\u03b2 expression or not was detected in 5 and 4, respectively, but resulted in no further clinicopathologic differences. TCR\u03b2 positivity without TCR\u03b3 expression (\u03b2\u03b3) was seen in 9 GITCL patients (21%). Twenty-four patients (57%) were negative for TCR\u03b2 and \u03b3 expression (\u03b2\u03b3). Compared with TCR\u03b2\u03b3 or \u03b2\u03b3 type, TCR\u03b3 cases were characterized by exclusive involvement of intestinal sites (100% vs. 11%, P<0.001; 100% vs. 58%, P=0.032, respectively), but not of stomach (0% vs. 78%, P=0.002; 0% vs. 38%, P=0.039, respectively). Notably, TCR\u03b3 positivity was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor among our GITCL patients (P<0.001). Considering our results, TCR\u03b3 GITCL, that is, intestinal \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell lymphoma, appears to constitute a distinct disease entity.",

        "abstract": "Although induction immunochemotherapy including high-dose cytarabine and rituximab followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is recommended for younger patients (\u226465 years old) with untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), no standard induction and HDC regimen has been established. We conducted a phase II study of induction immunochemotherapy of R-High-CHOP/CHASER followed by HDC of LEED with ASCT in younger patients with untreated advanced MCL. Eligibility criteria included untreated MCL, stage II bulky to IV, and age 20-65 years. Patients received 1 cycle of R-High-CHOP followed by 3 cycles of CHASER every 3 weeks. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were harvested during CHASER. LEED with ASCT was delivered to patients who responded to R-High-CHOP/CHASER. The primary endpoint was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). From June 2008 to June 2012, 45 patients (median age 59 y; range 38-65 y) were enrolled. PBSCs were successfully harvested from 36 of 43 patients. Thirty-five patients completed ASCT. The 2-year PFS was 77% (80%CI 68-84), which met the primary endpoint. Five-year PFS and overall survival were 52% (95%CI 34-68%) and 71% (95%CI 51-84%), respectively. Overall response and complete response rates after induction immunochemotherapy were 96% and 82%, respectively. The most common Grade 4 toxicities were hematological. In younger patients with untreated MCL, R-High-CHOP/CHASER/LEED with ASCT demonstrated high efficacy and acceptable toxicity, and it can now be considered a standard treatment option.

        "abstract": "Mesotheliomas are frequently characterized by disruption of Hippo pathway due to deletion and/or mutation in genes, such as neurofibromin 2 (NF2). Hippo disruption attenuates yes-associated protein (YAP) phosphorylation allowing YAP to translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression. The role of disrupted Hippo pathway in maintenance of established mesotheliomas has been extensively investigated using cell lines; however, its involvement in development of human mesothelioma has not been explored much. Here, we employed immortalized human mesothelial cells to disrupt Hippo pathway. YAP phosphorylation was reduced on NF2 knockdown and the cells exhibited altered growth in vitro, developing tumors when transplanted into nude mice. Similar results were obtained from enforced expression of wild-type or constitutively active (S127A) YAP, indicating the crucial role of activated YAP in the transformation of mesothelial cells. Gene expression analysis comparing control- and YAP-transduced immortalized human mesothelial cells revealed phospholipase-C beta 4 (PLCB4) to be among the genes highly upregulated by YAP. PLCB4 was upregulated by YAP in immortalized human mesothelial cells and downregulated on YAP knockdown in Hippo-disrupted mesothelioma cell lines. PLCB4 knockdown attenuated the growth of YAP-transduced immortalized mesothelial cells and YAP-active, but not YAP-nonactive, mesothelioma cell lines. Our model system thus provides a versatile tool to investigate the mechanisms underlying mesothelioma development. We suggest that PLCB4 may be an attractive drug target for the treatment of mesothelioma.",

        "abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of malignant lymphoma; it derives from germinal center B cells. Although DLBCL harbors many genetic alterations, synergistic roles between such alterations in the development of lymphoma are largely undefined. We previously established a mouse model of lymphoma by transplanting gene-transduced germinal center B cells into mice. Here, we chose one of the frequently mutated genes in DLBCL, Card11 mutant, to explore its possible synergy with other genes, using our lymphoma model. Given that BCL6 and BCL2 expression and/or function are often deregulated in human lymphoma, we examined the possible synergy between Card11, Bcl6, and Bcl2. Germinal center B cells were induced in\u00a0vitro, transduced with Card11 mutant, Bcl6, and Bcl2, and transplanted. Mice rapidly developed lymphomas, with exogenously transduced Bcl2 being dispensable. Although some mice developed lymphoma in the absence of transduced Bcl6, the absence was compensated by elevated expression of endogenous Bcl6. Additionally, the synergy between Card11 mutant and Bcl6 in the development of lymphoma was confirmed by the fact that the combination of Card11 mutant and Bcl6 caused lymphoma or death significantly earlier and with higher penetrance than Card11 mutant or Bcl6 alone. Lymphoma cells expressed interferon regulatory factor 4 and PR domain 1, indicating their differentiation toward plasmablasts, which characterize activated B cell-like DLBCL that represents a clinically aggressive subtype in humans. Thus, our mouse model provides a versatile tool for studying the synergistic roles of altered genes underlying lymphoma development.",

Reports of this peculiar disease, do not commonly address the PD-L1 expression on IVLBCL tumor cells. Here, we describe a 51-year-old Japanese woman who presented with rapidly progressive cognitive decline and higher brain dysfunction. CT scan and MRI revealed multiple ischemic foci in the cerebral hemispheres, ground-glass opacity in the lungs, and splenomegaly. Random skin biopsy for IVLBCL diagnosis yielded negative results. The patient experienced a rapidly deteriorating clinical course with no treatment, and died from the disease after 3 months of hospitalization. Post-mortem examination revealed systemic intravascular plugging of lymphoma cells, without mass lesions in the central nervous system or in visceral organs such as the lungs, liver, pituitary gland, ovaries, and uterus. The tumor cells were positive for CD10, CD20, BCL2, BCL6, and MUM1, but not other lineage-specific markers. Notably, the tumor cells showed strong PD-L1 expression. Our case was diagnosed as IVLBCL with neoplastic PD-L1 expression. These findings suggest that PD-L1 is associated with immune evasion of IVLBCL and may play a role in the pathogenesis and peculiar biological behavior of this unique disease. Additionally, PD-L1 may represent a possible therapeutic target for immune check-point inhibitors.",

Here, we report two cases involving Japanese women aged 59 years, both with A-DLBCL with the hallmark cell appearance and both indistinguishable from common and giant cell-rich patterns, respectively, of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Case 1 was immunohistochemically positive for CD20, CD79a and OCT-2 but not for the other pan-B-cell markers, CD30 and ALK. Case 2 showed CD20 and CD30 positivity for 50% and 20% of tumor cells in addition to strong expression of p53 and MYC. Both were positive for fascin without Epstein-Barr virus association. Our cases provide additional support for the earlier reports that A-DLBCL exhibits clinicopathologic features distinct from ordinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and documented its broader morphologic diversity than previously recognized. They also shed light on the unique feature of absent expression of pan-B-cell markers except for CD20 and CD79a, suggesting that A-DLBCL may biologically mimic a gray zone or intermediate lymphoma between DLBCL and classic Hodgkin lymphoma.",

        "abstract": "EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), not otherwise specified (NOS), often affects the gastrointestinal tract. However, the prognostic significance of EBV associated with primary gastric DLBCL (gDLBCL) has not been established. This retrospective study included 240 patients with primary gDLBCL, diagnosed between 1995 and 2015. Tumor specimens were analyzed with EBER in situ hybridization. In 25 (10%) cases, tumor cells harbored EBV. The EBV group more frequently exhibited programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in microenvironment immune cells, but not tumor cells, compared to the EBV group (86% vs 43%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.006). Among 156 patients that received rituximab-containing chemotherapy, the EBV group had a significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the EBV group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0029). Multivariate analyses identified 3 independent adverse prognostic factors of OS: multiple gastric lesions (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002), EBER positivity (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003), and B symptoms (P\u00a0=\u00a0.018). These factors were combined to develop a gDLBCL prognostic (gDLP) model that significantly stratified the patients into 3 distinct risk groups (Scores: good\u00a0=\u00a00, intermediate\u00a0=\u00a01, and poor\u00a0=\u00a02/3, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) with 5-year OS rates of 100%, 81%, and 39%, respectively. Patients with EBV gDLBCL commonly exhibited microenvironmental PD-L1 expression and showed a significantly worse prognosis than subjects with EBV gDLBCL. Our gDLP model, which included EBV tumor cells, provided good predictions of clinical outcome and may be useful for selecting patients in trials in the immune-oncology era.",

Reports of this peculiar disease, do not commonly address the PD-L1 expression on IVLBCL tumor cells. Here, we describe a 51-year-old Japanese woman who presented with rapidly progressive cognitive decline and higher brain dysfunction. CT scan and MRI revealed multiple ischemic foci in the cerebral hemispheres, ground-glass opacity in the lungs, and splenomegaly. Random skin biopsy for IVLBCL diagnosis yielded negative results. The patient experienced a rapidly deteriorating clinical course with no treatment, and died from the disease after 3 months of hospitalization. Post-mortem examination revealed systemic intravascular plugging of lymphoma cells, without mass lesions in the central nervous system or in visceral organs such as the lungs, liver, pituitary gland, ovaries, and uterus. The tumor cells were positive for CD10, CD20, BCL2, BCL6, and MUM1, but not other lineage-specific markers. Notably, the tumor cells showed strong PD-L1 expression. Our case was diagnosed as IVLBCL with neoplastic PD-L1 expression. These findings suggest that PD-L1 is associated with immune evasion of IVLBCL and may play a role in the pathogenesis and peculiar biological behavior of this unique disease. Additionally, PD-L1 may represent a possible therapeutic target for immune check-point inhibitors.",

The contrast-enhanced EUS indicated vascular tumors with gradual enhancement in four patients and a hypovascular tumor in one patient. The elastography indicated an elastic score of 3 (hard lesion with softer border) in two patients and a score of 5 (hard lesion, which included the surrounding area) in two patients. In tumors with an elastic score of 5, the pathology exhibited abundant hyalinizing fibrous stroma or massive tumor invasion to the surrounding tissue. We concluded that acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas has various patterns of EUS contrast-enhancement and elastography, depending on the pathologic phenotype.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aims  In the International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria (ICDC), autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is classified into types 1 and 2, and its definite histopathology diagnosis can be made based only on surgical or core biopsy specimens. Although EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) biopsy is a safe technique for the collection of pancreatic tissue, no consensus viewpoint has been reached with regard to the role of EUS-FNA biopsy in the diagnosis of AIP. This study investigated the utility of pancreatic tissue collected by EUS-FNA biopsy by using a standard 22-gauge aspiration needle in the diagnosis of AIP.  Methods  Patients with suspected AIP were prospectively enrolled in Nagoya University Hospital and Nagoya University\u2013affiliated institutions. Pancreatic tissue was collected from each by EUS-FNA biopsy with a standard 22-gauge aspiration needle.  Results  Fifty patients were registered, including 45 with a final diagnosis of AIP. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and abundant immunoglobulin G 4 \u2013positive plasmacyte infiltration (u003e10/high-power field) were detected in 36\u00a0(72%) and 27 (54%) patients, respectively. Obliterative phlebitis and storiform fibrosis were not detected in our study. Granulocytic epithelial lesions (GEL) were observed in 3 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of EUS-FNA biopsy to definitively diagnose AIP were 7.9% (3/38), 100% (12/12), 100% (3/3), and 25.5% (12/47), respectively. Pathology evaluation of pancreatic tissue collected by EUS-FNA biopsy improved the diagnostic accuracy in 8 (16%) of the 50 patients.  Conclusions  In this study, EUS-FNA biopsy by using a standard 22-gauge aspiration needle is not an effective diagnostic method for most patients with AIP. The combination of level 2 histology diagnosis of AIP with other findings specified in the ICDC slightly improved the diagnostic accuracy, although it still remains insufficiently accurate for\u00a0routine clinical use.(Clinical trial registration number: 000006297.)",

Recently, mutations in exon 3 of the gene coding for \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) and its nuclear expression were discovered in SN-GPC. \u03b2-catenin protein is a key regulatory molecule of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The expression of \u03b2-catenin target proteins is not well characterized in SN-GPC. We examined three SN-GPCs by immunohistochemistry and CTNNB1 mutation analysis. All cases expressed nuclear \u03b2-catenin. We identified CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations in two analyzable cases. Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), a protein downstream from \u03b2-catenin, was also expressed in all cases. Our results further characterized the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway caused by CTNNB1 exon 3 mutation and suggest the utility of LEF1 immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of SN-GPC.",

Here, we aimed to develop a new PCC prognostic model, focusing on the invasive proportion. Methods: Among 605 patients with surgically resected cholangiocarcinoma in Nagoya University Hospital between 2000 and 2011, 173 (29%) had intraductal exophytic papillary lesions. These were divided into four subsets based on the invasive component: non-invasive (PCC-1, n = 13), \u226410% (PCC-2, n = 30), 11-50% (PCC-3, n = 55), and u003e50% (PCC-4, n = 75). Results: Invasion beyond the ductal wall was observed in 83% of PCCs and 99% of non-papillary cholangiocarcinomas (NPCC, n = 432; P u003c 0.001). Regional lymph node metastases were more frequent in NPCC (48%) than PCC (32%; P u003c 0.001). Five-year survival was better for PCC (52%) than NPCC...",

        "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a key component in the tumor microenvironment and play functional roles in tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapies. We have previously reported that CAFs isolated from lymphoma samples increase anaerobic glycolysis and decrease intracellular production of reactive oxygen species, promoting the survival of tumor cells. Here, we analyzed the mechanisms underlying this support of tumor-cell survival by CAFs. As direct contact between lymphoma cells and CAFs was not indispensable to survival support, we identified that the humoral factor pyruvate was significantly secreted by CAFs. Moreover, survival of lymphoma cells was promoted by the presence of pyruvate, and this promotion was cancelled by the inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters. Metabolome analysis of lymphoma cells in co-culture with CAFs demonstrated that intermediates in the citric acid cycle were significantly increased, indicating that tumor cells produced energy by aerobic metabolism. These findings indicate that energy production in lymphoma cells is regulated in coordination with not only anaerobic glycolysis, but also aerobic metabolism termed the reverse-Warburg effect, involving the secretion of pyruvate from CAFs resulting in increased use of the citric acid cycle in lymphoma cells.

        "abstract": "Although the clinical outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have improved in the immunochemotherapy era, approximately one-third of patients develop intractable disease. To improve clinical outcomes for these patients, it is important to identify those with poor prognosis prior to initial treatment in order to select optimal therapies. Here, we investigated the clinical and biological significance of SPIB, an Ets family transcription factor linked to lymphomagenesis, in DLBCL. We classified 134 DLBCL patients into SPIB negative (n\u00a0=\u00a0108) or SPIB positive (n\u00a0=\u00a026) groups by immunohistochemical staining. SPIB positive patients had a significantly worse treatment response and poor prognosis compared with SPIB negative patients. Multivariate analysis for patient survival indicated that SPIB expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for both progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-5.33, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006; OS, HR 3.56, 95% CI 1.43-8.91, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Subsequent analyses of the roles of SPIB expression in DLBCL pathogenesis revealed that SPIB expression in lymphoma cells resulted in resistance to the BH3-mimetic ABT-263 and contributed to apoptosis resistance via the PI3K-AKT pathway. The inhibition of AKT phosphorylation re-sensitized SPIB expressing lymphoma cells to ABT-263-induced cell death. Together, our data indicate that SPIB expression is a clinically novel poor prognostic factor in DLBCL that contributes to treatment resistance, at least in part, through an anti-apoptotic mechanism.

This is a summary report of the consensus meeting held in the 4th Asian Hematopathology Workshop. The umbrella term \u201cEBV-positive T/NK lymphoproliferative disease in childhood-type\u201d covers the entire spectrum of EBV-associated lesions in childhood, ranging from reactive to neoplastic processes. Systemic T/NK cell lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) of childhood type is defined as a fulminant disease associated with the proliferation of polyclonal, oligoclonal, or monoclonal T or NK cells and includes aggressive NK cell-associated leukemia in children. Chronic active EBV disease-type T/NK cell LPD is divided into three groups\u2014polymorphic/polyclonal, polymorphic/monoclonal, and monomorphic/monoclonal\u2014based on the histology and clonality of T or NK cells. A monoclonal EBV-positive T/NK cell type of proliferation with the clinical features of chronic active EBV disease rather than the fulminant course of systemic EBV-positive T/NK cell LPD of childhood is considered \u201cchronic active EBV disease-type T/NK cell LPD\u201d. Hydroa vacciniforme (HV)-like T cell LPD is defined as a spectrum of EBV-infected T cell proliferative diseases with homing to the skin and is further classified into a classic type, a severe type, and malignant lymphoma. Criteria to define each category of HV-like T cell LPD remain to be clarified.",

        "abstract": "Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a systemic inflammatory disease potentially caused by an increase in the serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level. Idiopathic MCD (iMCD) is histopathologically classified into three types: plasmacytic (PC), mixed, and hypervascular (hyperV) types. Recently, a unique clinical phenotype with a poor prognosis overlap with iMCD, thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal failure or reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly (TAFRO syndrome), has been reported from Japan, but its detailed clinicopathological features remain unclear. In this study, we performed a clinicopathological analysis of 70 nodal cases of iMCD with and without TAFRO syndrome (n=37 vs. n=33). Compared with iMCD without TAFRO, iMCD with TAFRO showed more atrophic lymphoid follicles (LF), greater distances between follicles, increased glomeruloid vascular proliferation within the germinal center, and increased follicular dendritic cells. In addition, the hyperV-type in particular demonstrated severe atrophic LF and interfollicular vascular proliferation. Among the mixed type cases, the serum IL-6 levels in iMCD with TAFRO were significantly higher than those in iMCD without TAFRO. Furthermore, compared to iMCD without TAFRO, the numbers of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-positive and CD38-positive plasma cells were significantly decreased in iMCD with TAFRO.",

        "title": "Comparison of Laboratory Data of Patients with Tafro Syndrome and Idiopathic Multicentric Castleman Disease: A Japanese Retrospective Study",
        "abstract": "Background: First described in 2010, TAFRO syndrome is a clinical disorder presenting as thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis, renal insufficiency, and organomegaly with unknown etiology. Onset of this syndrome is usually acute or subacute, and disease progression is rapid; a percentage of patients with this disorder have unfavorable clinical courses. Therefore, it is critical to identify an optimal management strategy for this disorder. Histopathological features of lymph nodes from patients with TAFRO syndrome are usually indistinguishable from that of patients with Castleman disease (CD) of mixed type histology. In addition, clinical features of patients with TAFRO syndrome are similar to those of patients with multicentric CD (MCD). Accordingly, some investigators assume TAFRO syndrome as a subcategory of idiopathic MCD (iMCD). However, whether TAFRO syndrome is entirely a part of iMCD category of diseases, or whether these are similar yet distinct disorders has not been clarified.  Aims: To elucidate the clinical features of TAFRO syndrome, and to clarify the association between TAFRO syndrome and iMCD.  Methods: Since 2013, a multicenter retrospective clinical study has been conducted by the Japanese TAFRO Syndrome Research Group. By July 2016, data of u003e200 patients with suspected TAFRO syndrome or MCD were collected. Utilizing this database, we compared laboratory data of patients with TAFRO syndrome with those of iMCD patients without TAFRO features. Diagnosis of TAFRO syndrome was defined according to our diagnostic criteria as previously described (Int J Hematol 2016;103:686-692), and the diagnosis of MCD was defined by pathological findings of lymph nodes. HIV or HHV-8 positive patients were excluded from this study. Comparisons between the two groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. P values of   Results: According to our criteria, 84 patients were diagnosed with TAFRO syndrome, and 88 patients were diagnosed with non-TAFRO iMCD. Male to female ratios and median ages at diagnosis were comparable between these two groups. Hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-guanosine triphosphate (\u0192A-GTP), ferritin, triglyceride, and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with TAFRO syndrome than in patients with iMCD (Table 1). In contrast, platelet count, IgG, and albumin levels were significantly lower in patients with TAFRO syndrome than in patients with iMCD (Table 1). Seventeen of 84 TAFRO patients died due to disease progression, infection, or hemorrhage, whereas only 4 of 88 non-TAFRO iMCD patients died.  Discussion: TAFRO syndrome is defined based on clinical manifestations and CD is defined via typical histopathological findings of affected lymph nodes. Consistent with its definition, patients with TAFRO syndrome in our cohort showed low platelet counts and renal dysfunction, which were not commonly observed in non-TAFRO iMCD patients. Serum ALP and \u0192A-GTP were significantly elevated in patients with TAFRO syndrome, whereas they were within the normal ranges in patients with non-TAFRO iMCD. Interestingly, serum IgG level was not elevated in TAFRO patients, whereas it was remarkably elevated in non-TAFRO iMCD patients. Similarly, low serum LDH level was another characteristic in iMCD patients that was not commonly observed in TAFRO patients. The majority of TAFRO patients showed D-dimer elevation, indicating that this syndrome is frequently accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome. Patients with TAFRO syndrome followed relatively aggressive courses, whereas most patients with non-TAFRO iMCD in our cohort followed indolent clinical courses.  Conclusions: Although several clinical and pathological features of TAFRO syndrome resembled those of iMCD, these two conditions manifested distinct laboratory parameters and differing clinical courses. From the results of this study, we postulate that TAFRO syndrome may not be a sub-category of iMCD and that both are distinct diseases with overlapping features.

In our previous report, a clinicopathological analysis was performed on 70 nodal cases of iMCD with/without TAFRO. iMCD is classified into three types based on histopathology: (i) plasmacytic (PC), (ii) mixed, and (iii) hypervascular (hyperV). In this report, extranodal histopathological changes of iMCD with/without TAFRO were analyzed. Regarding the kidney pathology, we observed the proliferation of mesangial cells with positive staining of interleukin-6 (IL-6), consistent with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, in two cases of iMCD with TAFRO. The number of megakaryocytes per high-powered fields was not significantly different between iMCD cases with and without TAFRO. In conclusion, extranodal lesions of iMCD with/without TAFRO showed various interesting histopathological findings. These lesions may therefore be related to the clinical condition of TAFRO. Obtaining further knowledge about TAFRO will require the observation of nodal as well as extranodal lesions.",

        "abstract": "Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology caused by hypercytokinemia. Recently, TAFRO (thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal failure or reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly) syndrome has been reported, which shows similar histopathological findings to iMCD and factors associated with a poor prognosis. iMCD shows no plasma cell infiltration in the germinal center (GC), but CD38-positive (CD38)-plasma cells are observed in the interfollicular area. Our previous report revealed that atrophic change of GC, glomeruloid vascular proliferation, and abnormal proliferation of follicular dendritic cells are more prominent in iMCD with TAFRO (TAFRO) in comparison to iMCD without TAFRO (TAFRO). In addition, the numbers of CD38 and immunoglobulin G4-positive (IgG4) plasma cells were decreased in the interfollicular area. The roles of T follicular helper cells (Tfh) are well-known to assist B-cell proliferation, maturation, and differentiation\uff0eIt maintains the formation of GC and is also related in the class switching of IgG isotypes, including IgG4. Thus, we immunohistochemically examined the number of Tfh in GCs in both TAFRO and TAFRO iMCD. The number of Tfh was significantly decreased in TAFRO iMCD (n\u2009=\u20099) and was further decreased in TAFRO iMCD (n\u2009=\u200918) in comparison to non-specific lymphadenopathy (n\u2009=\u20096) and IgG4-related disease (n\u2009=\u20094). These results suggest that decreased Tfh may be one etiology of iMCD.",

Here, we describe a case of a 75-year-old man who developed an EBV-positive (EBV+) mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU) in the gingiva with spontaneous regression. Eighteen months after regression, he had a cervical lymph node enlargement that was diagnosed as EBV+ nodal polymorphous B-LPD, Ann Arbor stage IA. Clinicians decided to observe his clinical course without any treatment. Fourteen months later, the patient developed EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Ann Arbor stage IIA, and received six courses of age-adjusted dose chemotherapy and achieved a complete remission. No evidence of a clonal relationship was found among these three lesions by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for immunoglobulin heavy chain. However, they all had expression of PD-L1 in the EBV+ large B-cells and Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg-like cells. This is the first case report of a PD-L1-positive (PD-L1+) EBVMCU and the development of multiple EBV-driven B-LPDs in the setting of immunosenescence within a 32-month period.",

The patient, a 52-year-old woman, received chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). She achieved complete remission and was followed up in an outpatient clinic after discharge. One year later, EBVMCU appeared in the tongue and exhibited spontaneous regression. Six months after the regression of the EBVMCU, she had EBV polymorphic PTLD, analogous to EBV polymorphic DLBCL. The therapy for PTLD was not effective, and the patient finally died of disease progression. This was the first case of EBVMCU characterized by both an association with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and subsequent emergence of malignant lymphoma in a patient with relapsed DLBCL.",

        "abstract": "Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is synthesized in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells (ECs) and has two main roles: to carry and protect coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) from degradation by forming VWF-FVIII complex; and to mediate platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury. Previous research using the HEK293 cell line revealed that the VWF K1362 mutation interacted directly with platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). Vwf K1362A knock-in (KI) mice were therefore generated to verify the in vivo function of residue 1362 in binding to platelet GPIb. The Cre-loxP system was employed to introduce the Vwf K1362A mutation systemically in mice. In blood coagulation analysis, the VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) of Lys1362Ala KI homozygous (homo) mice was below the sensitivity of detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. FVIII activities (FVIII:C) were 47.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 and 3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3% (K1362A heterozygous (hetero) and K1362A KI homo mice, respectively) compared to wild-type mice. Immunohistochemical staining analysis revealed that VWF protein did not exist in ECs of K1362A KI homo mice. These results indicated that VWF protein synthesis of K1362A was impaired after transcription in mice. K1362 seems to represent a very important position not only for VWF function, but also for VWF synthesis in mice.",

        "title": "Genetic Analysis of Von Willebrand Disease By Using the Exome Sequencing Approach",
        "abstract": "Background: Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder characterized by quantitative and/or qualitative von Willebrand factor (VWF) abnormalities.  VWF  gene is a large gene consists of 52 exons, wheras its pseudogene corresponds to exons 23-34 that makes the analysis much complicated. In this study, we performed genetic analyses of the  VWF  gene from 20 Japanese VWD patients, aimed to find the causative genetic mutations by using various techniques including the exome sequencing approach, and to explore the diversity of yet unknown VWD pathogenetic mechanisms.  Methods: Patients9 samples were collected after the written informed consent has been obtained. First, we analyzed exon 28 of  VWF  genes from peripheral blood genomic DNA of the patients by PCR using allele-specific primers, and analyzed DNA sequences of the patients by Sanger sequencing method. If patients show the type 3 phenotype, the possibility of deletion or insertion of the gene was taken into consideration, then MLPA method was selected. In cases the gene mutation was not detected by exon 28 sequencing or MLPA, we analyzed all exons of  VWF  by Sanger method. In selected patients, the exome sequencing was employed by using the next-generation sequencer Hi-Seq 2500 (Illumina) and exomes were captured using SureSelect XT Human All Exon V5+UTRs kit (Agilent Technologies).  Results: Twenty VWD cases were studied. As a result of the  VWF  exon 28 sequencing, we identified causative gene mutation in 12 cases (10 cases were type 2, 2 cases were type 1). Gene mutations found in exon 28 were p.R1308C, p.R1315C, p.V1316M, p.R1334W, p.A1461D, p.L1503R, p.S1506L, p.R1597Q, p.G1609R. In one case and her sister of type 3, MLPA could not detect the large deletions or insertions. Sanger sequencing showed the they were compound heterozygous for an p.E2341X (c.7021Gu003eT) mutation in exon 41 and a p.Y2631X (c.7892-7893insA) mutation in exon 48. In another case of type 3, we used exome sequencing and found a novel homozygous gene mutation p.G2752S (c.8254Gu003eA) in exon 52. The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and the propositus was homozygote for the mutation, while the parents and two sons had the same mutation in the heterozygote. In the multimer analysis of plasma, multimers larger than the dimer in size were hardly visible, but there was a faint monomer band was present in the plasma. Multimeric patterns of his family were normal.  Discussion: We analyzed the  VWF  genes of 20 VWD cases and identified causative gene mutations in 14 cases including three novel mutations (p.E2341X, p.Y2631X, p.G2752S). We previously demonstrated BOECs established from the type 3 patient (p.E2341X and p.Y2631X) reproduced the phenotype of the disease (ASH 2014). Meanwhile, G2752S mutation is located in CTCK domain, therefore possibly it affects the VWF dimer formation. However, the causative gene mutations were not detected in 6 cases (5 cases were type 1, 1 case was type 2) by exome sequencing. Although previous observations have pointed out that causative  VWF  gene mutations are not detectable in about 30 % of entire type 1 cases, a newer approach would be needed to elucidate molecular pathogenesis of VWD.

However, OIS can contribute to tumor development via tissue remodeling in some tumors. Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, is one such tumor. Its clinical and histological features vary, making it difficult to diagnose. Herein, we describe an autopsy of an ECD patient. The patient underwent radiological examinations, including  F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), bone scintigraphy and CT. A biopsy from the lesion with the highest FDG accumulation confirmed the presence of foamy macrophages, a diagnostic clue for ECD. Based on this finding and the clinical features, ECD was diagnosed. However, the patient died from heart dysfunction. After the autopsy, each radiologically different site showed various histological findings regarding the morphology of macrophages, fibrosis, inflammation, and p16 expression. OIS-induced histological progression can cause certain changes observed in radiological images. In addition, in order to evaluate the increase in glucose metabolism, which can affect FDG accumulation, the expression of glucose transporter 1 and hexokinase II was also analyzed. Summarizing the radio-histological correlation can help further both the understanding and diagnosis of ECD.",

        "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) is a widely accepted method to evaluate EBV involvement in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), although little is known regarding associations between EBV DNA load and the EBER status and whether EBV DNA load data provide additional clinical information. In this study, we quantified EBV DNA load in diagnostic specimens from DLBCL patients diagnosed at our hospital to evaluate clinical implications of EBV DNA load in diagnostic specimens as contrasted with EBER-ISH. Among 140 DLBCL patients without underlying immunodeficiency, 51 were evaluable for both EBER and EBV DNA load, 83 for EBER only and one for EBV DNA load only. The median EBV DNA load was 708\u2009copies/\u00b5g. Although EBV DNA load was significantly higher for EBER-positive patients than for EBER-negative patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001), EBV DNA was detected in up to 72% of EBER-negative patients. Progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly worse for patients with EBV DNA load above 700\u2009copies/\u00b5g than for those with EBV DNA load below 700\u2009copies/\u00b5g (p\u2009=\u20090.009 and p\u2009=\u20090.003); they were also significantly worse for EBER-positive patients than for EBER-negative patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.001). Even among EBER-negative patients, higher EBV DNA load conferred worse progression-free survival and overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.041 and p\u2009=\u20090.013). These findings indicate that EBV DNA load in diagnostic specimens is not a simple surrogate for the EBER status and may be a potential biomarker associated with EBV involvement and prognosis in DLBCL.

        "abstract": "It is still a matter of debate whether detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in pretreatment serum has clinical implications for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For this study, we measured EBV DNA load in pretreatment serum from 127 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients without any underlying immunodeficiency to evaluate its effects on clinical manifestations and prognosis. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy in combination with rituximab was given as initial therapy for 119 patients (94%). Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in 15 patients (12%), who were older (P = 0.005) and tended to be at a more advanced disease stage (P = 0.053). They showed significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than other patients (P < 0.001 each). This effect remained significant (P = 0.004 and P = 0.027, respectively) after adjustment for age, lactate dehydrogenase, performance status, stage, and extranodal sites. The status of EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization was known for 123 patients; 6 of 8 positive patients (75%) and 9 of 115 negative patients (8%) had detectable EBV DNA in pretreatment serum. While patients positive for EBV-encoded small RNA had significantly worse PFS and OS than negative patients (P = 0.001 and P = 0.029, respectively), EBV DNA detection in pretreatment serum was associated with poorer PFS and OS even for the 115 patients negative for EBV-encoded small RNA (P < 0.001 each). These findings suggest that EBV DNA detection in pretreatment serum may have an adverse prognostic impact for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. ",

        "title": "Prognostic Significance of EBV Association in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in the Rituximab Era",
        "abstract": "Introduction:  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous group of diseases in terms of morphology, immunohistochemistry and molecular features. The prognostic factors of DLBCL in the rituximab era are different from previously reported prognostic factors. Hans,  et al . reported that patients with non-germinal center B-cell like (GCB)-type DLBCL had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with GCB-type DLBCL in the pre-rituximab era. In patients who received rituximab combination chemotherapy, there is a report that did not find a difference in survival ratio between those with GCB DLBCL or non-GCB DLBCL. On the other hand, there was a report that found a difference in survival ratio between patients with GCB DLBCL and those with non-GCB DLBCL. In addition, the previously reported that patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive DLBCL had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with EBV-negative DLBCL in the pre-rituximab era. In the present study, we considered the prognostic factors of DLBCL patients who received rituximab combined chemotherapy.   Patients and Methods:  The subjects were 209 DLBCL patients in whom immunohistochemical markers (CD20, CD5, CD10, BCL-2, BCL-6, MUM-1) could be analyzed. In addition, 86 patients were examined EBV-encoded RNA (EBER)  in situ  hybridization. Pathologic evaluation of the materials from each patient was performedat several central review meetings by six hematopathologists in the ALTSG pathology review board. Patients were treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and prednisolone (CyclOBEAP) regimen or CHOP regimen. Rituximab was administered to all patients. One hundred forty-six DLBCL patients who underwent CHOP-like therapy were assumed as historical controls. The median follow-up period was 69 months (range, 46-88months).   Results:  In the R-chemotherapy and CHOP-like groups, patients with stage III or IV disease comprised 57% and 67%, respectively, patients with performance status\u22672 comprised 32% and 23%, respectively, and patients with serum LDH u003enormal comprised 61% and 69%, respectively. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the R-chemotherapy group and CHOP-like group. BCL2 was positive in 72 (55%) of the 131 patients who received the R-chemotherapy and in 71 (50%) of the 142 patients who received the CHOP-like regimen. When the 209 patients who received the R- chemotherapy group were divided into the GCB group and the non-GCB group, the GCB group consisted of 74 patients (35%) and the non-GCB group consisted of 135 patients. The relationships between immunohistological markers and outcome among the patients with DLBCL who received CHOP-like therapy were studied. CD5, CD10, and BCL6 had no prognostic impact on 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates. When the patients were divided into the GCB DLBCL and non-GCB DLBCL groups, the 5-year PFS of the GCB group was 78% and that of the non-GCB group was 48% (p=0.0008). Next, the effect of rituximab with chemotherapy was examined. CD5, CD10, BCL2, BCL6, and MUM-1 had no prognostic impact on 5-year OS and PFS rates. When the patients were divided into the GCB DLBCL (n=74) and non-GCB DLBCL (n=135) groups, the 4-year PFS of the GCB group was 79% and that of the non-GCB group was 73%, showing no significant difference.  We also evaluated the significance of EBER expression among patients by incorporating the EBV-positive DLBCL (n=14) and EBV-negative DLBCL (n=72).There were no significant differences in immunophenotyping analysis between the EBV-positive DLBCL and EBV-negative DLBCL. As for EBER expression in DLBCL, the 4-year PFS of the EBER-positive group was 37% and that of the EBER-negative group was 75% (P=0.007), indicating that the EBER-positive group showed significantly poorer prognosis. The 4-year OS of the EBER-positive group was 50% and the EBER-negative group was 86% (P=0.0005).   Conclusions:  The EBER may be an important prognostic factor in patients with DLBCL who underwent R-chemotherapy therapy.  Disclosures  No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",

The present study reports a case of a 71-year-old female with EMZL of the uterine cervix that was 80 mm in diameter and invaded directly into the rectal serosa. Complete remission was successfully induced by 6 courses of immunochemotherapy with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone. Although the metaphase spread of the tumor cells was unavailable for whole cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence  hybridization (FISH) detected triple signals for  and B-cell lymphoma 2, located at chromosome 18q21, and the centromere of chromosome 18, which was suggestive of trisomy 18, and in combination with previous studies, suggested a possible association between trisomy 18 and the large tumor at initial presentation in the present patient. In addition, FISH examination detected immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, although the translocation partner was unconfirmed. A total of 18 previously-studied patients with EMZL of the uterus, including that of the present study, were reviewed with respect to their clinical features and treatment and cytogenetic abnormality. In the evaluation of the English scientific literature, this is the first reported patient with EMZL of the uterus with partly determined cytogenetic abnormalities.",

        "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is highly prevalent in humans and is implicated in various diseases, including cancer. Chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) is an intractable disease classified as a lymphoproliferative disorder in the 2016 World Health Organization lymphoma classification. CAEBV is characterized by EBV-infected T/natural killer (NK) cells and recurrent/persistent infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms. Here, we show that CAEBV originates from an EBV-infected lymphoid progenitor that acquires DDX3X and other mutations, causing clonal evolution comprising multiple cell lineages. Conspicuously, the EBV genome in CAEBV patients harboured frequent intragenic deletions (27/77) that were also common in various EBV-associated neoplastic disorders (28/61), including extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but were not detected in infectious mononucleosis or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (0/47), which suggests a unique role of these mutations in neoplastic proliferation of EBV-infected cells. These deletions frequently affected BamHI A rightward transcript microRNA clusters (31 cases) and several genes that are essential for producing viral particles (20 cases). The deletions observed in our study are thought to reactivate the lytic cycle by upregulating the expression of two immediate early genes, BZLF1 and BRLF1, while averting viral production and subsequent cell lysis. In fact, the deletion of one of the essential genes, BALF5, resulted in upregulation of the lytic cycle and the promotion of lymphomagenesis in a xenograft model. Our findings highlight a pathogenic link between intragenic EBV deletions and EBV-associated neoplastic proliferations.",

        "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (EBV+ DLBCL) is typically an aggressive tumor in elderly patients. However, in a subset of young patients, EBV+ DLBCL follows a relatively indolent clinical course and exhibits a good response to chemotherapy. This lymphoma comprises polymorphous lymphoma and large cell lymphomas subtypes, with the latter subtype showing a significantly poorer prognosis. It is unknown whether the genetic background differs between age groups and histopathological subtypes. To investigate the genetic basis, heterogeneity, and recurrently mutated genes in EBV+ DLBCL, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from 11 tissue samples of this lymphoma. Sequencing revealed that the most common substitution was the transition C>T/G>A. Genetic features-including the numbers of mutated genes in exonic region, single-nucleotide variants (SNV), and indels-did not significantly differ between age groups or histological subtypes. Matching with the COSMIC database revealed that the main mutational signature was signature 3, which is associated with failure of DNA double-strand break-repair by homologous recombination. Mutant-Allele Tumor Heterogeneity (MATH) scores showed that EBV+ DLBCL exhibited broad intratumor heterogeneity, and were positively correlated with Ann Arbor Stage and \u22652 extranodal lesion sites. We identified 57 selected recurrently mutated genes. The most commonly mutated five genes-LNP1 (11/11), PRSS3 (10/11), MUC3A (9/11), FADS6 (9/11), and TRAK1 (8/11)-were validated by Sanger sequencing. These mutated genes have not previously been identified. Overall, our present results demonstrate the tremendous genetic heterogeneity underlying EBV+ DLBCLs, and highlight the need for personalized therapeutic approaches to treating these patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: It is not known which population of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients should continue endocrine treatment beyond 5 years to overcome late recurrences. The aim of this study was to examine a combination of nuclear grade (NG) and expression level of ER and progesterone receptor (PR) to predict late recurrences.  Methods: We assessed retrospectively 1677 consecutive ER-positive/HER2-negative patients who underwent surgical resection between 2004 and 2009. Patients with T2 or larger tumor and/or node-positive received pre- or postoperative chemotherapy following the international consensus panel from the St Gallen Conference, 2003. All patients had received adjuvant endocrine treatment. NG, ER and PR statuses were determined by immunohistochemistory on surgical specimen. We classified the patients into 3 groups as follows; ER-high (+++ or Allred score 7, 8)/PR-high (++ to +++ or 5-8) (n=212), ER-high / PR-low (- to + or 3-6) (n=208), and ER-low (+ to ++ or 3-6) / PR-any (n=255). We compared distant disease-free survival (DDFS) in each cohort based on the NG (1:low, and 2 or 3: high).  Results: A median follow-up period was 77.0 months. Four hundred sixty seven patients (27.8%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 208 patients (12.4%) received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 1002 patients (59.8%) did not received chemotherapy. Of the 467 patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 65 patients (13.9%) had developed distant metastasis during study period (before 5 years in 51 (11.0%); and after 5 years in 14 (3.0%)). NG-low had significantly higher risk of late recurrence after 5 years than that of NG-high (p=0.005). According to hormonal receptor expression levels, in patients with NG-low, ER-low/PR-any had significantly higher overall DDFS rate than ER-high/PR-low (p=0.016). A similar trend was found before 5 years (p=0.077). However, ER-high/PR-high turned to have significantly high risk of recurrence after 5 years compared to ER-low/PR-any (p=0.024). Of the 208 patients with adjuvant chemotherapy, 16 patients (7.6%) had developed distant metastasis during study period (before 5 years in 5 (2.4%), and after 5 years in 11 (5.2%)). there was no association between a risk of recurrence and hormone receptor statuses at any study period. In the patients did not received chemotherapy, ER-high/PR-high had a trend of higher DDFS rate than others before 5 years (p=0.067). Of the 1002 patients without chemotherapy, only 36 patients (3.6%) had developed distant metastasis during study period (before 5 years in 27 (2.7%), and after 5 years in 9 (0.9%)). There was no difference of late recurrence after 5 years among the patients regardless of ER and PR expression level and NG with only low recurrence rate (0.9%).  Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that, in ER-positive/HER2-negative patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, NG-low/ER-high/PR-high should receive extend hormonal treatment over 5 years because of the high risk of late recurrence but NG-high/ER-high might not need. Furthermore, patients with T1 and node-negative may not need extend hormonal treatment because of the extremely low risk of late recurrence regardless of NG and hormone receptor statuses.
