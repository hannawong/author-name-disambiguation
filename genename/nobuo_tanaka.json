The crystal belongs to the monoclinic system, space group P 2 1 / n , with four formula units in a cell of dimensions: a 8.752(3), b 11.444(4), c 19.095(5) \u00c5 and \u03b2 92.06(3)\u00b0 at \u2212160\u00b0C; a 8.801(1), b 11.562(2), c 19.390(2) \u00c5 and \u03b2 91.53(1)\u00b0 at 20\u00b0C. The structure was solved by the heavy atom method, and refined by the least-squares procedure to R \ue5fb 0.033 (\u2212160\u00b0C) and 0.039 (20\u00b0C) for non-zero reflections. No essential difference is observed between molecular structures at \u2212160 and 20\u00b0C. The coordination mode of the thia-allyl group ((MeOCO) 2 CHCH 2 (Me)C(Me 2 N)C\ue5fbS), which is bound to the palladium atom through the Pd\ue5f8C \u03c3-bond and the donation of the sulfur atom to the metal atom, is not a \u03c0-type but a \u03c3-type [Pd\ue5f8C(7) 2.058(3), Pd\ue5f8S 2.262(1), C(6)\u2013C(7) 1.506(4) and C(6)\ue5f8S 1.709(3) \u00c5 at \u2212160\u00b0C]. The relatively short Pd\ue5f8S bond may show strong donation of the sulfur to the metal atom. The geometry around the palladium atom is essentially square-planar. The C(6), C(7) and S atoms in the thia-allyl group are almost coplanar with the palladium atom.",

        "abstract": "The separation mechanism of amino acid enantiomers using a chiral crown ether-bonded stationary phase, CROWNPAK CR-I(+), and acetonitrile (ACN)-rich mobile phases (MPs) was studied. The retention factors of proteinogenic l-amino acids (except proline) formed U-shaped plots against the ACN content in the MP with a sharp increase at a high ACN content, while d-amino acids showed much smaller increases or monotonous decreases in retention within the same range. The use of an acidic, highly organic MP with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) provided a high enantioselectivity with a short separation time from the contribution of the increased binding of the ammonium group of the analytes to the crown ether functionality of the stationary phase and electrostatic repulsion counteracting the hydrophilic partition mechanism. Optimizing the sample diluent and MP alleviated the peak distortion caused by a moving water band that accompanied the hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-like elution conditions. The liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry method with the optimized MP - ACN/ethanol/water/TFA\u2009=\u200980/15/5/0.5 (v/v/v/v) - enabled the determination of eighteen pairs of proteinogenic amino acid enantiomers within 10\u2009min. The conditions also provided the following advantages: (i) fast and highly reproducible separations under isocratic conditions, (ii) high sensitivity and low backpressure using the MP with a high organic content, and (iii) highly reliable peak identification by combining two columns (CR-I(+) and CR-I(-)), reversing the elution orders of the enantiomers.",

The structures of the composite films, especially of the iron crystallites embedded, are studied by high-resolution electron microscopy and nanometer-area electron diffraction. The alpha-iron (b.c.c.) crystallites of 1 nm in size are epitaxially embedded in single crystalline MgO films, the orientation being (011)[100]Fe parallel (001)[100]MgO and (001)[110]Fe parallel (001)[100]MgO. A heat treatment of the as-grown films at 500-1,000 degrees C brings about a phase transformation of the crystallites from alpha-iron to gamma-iron (f.c.c.), followed by a grain growth of alpha-iron and finally the growth of the spinel, MgFe2O4. The gamma-iron crystallites transformed are circular plates and have strains at the periphery to accommodate the surrounding MgO-matrix. The magnetic property of the composite films is also reported.",

High-resolution electron microscopy shows the images of aggregates of C 60 molecules as ring-like black contrast at the edge of islands prepared at room temperature and 180\u00b0C. Image simulations of one C 60 molecule located on MgO crystals of 10 and 20 nm thickness are presented, and the possibility of detection of the molecule is discussed in relation to the use of imaging under off-Bragg condition.",

The nanometer-area diffraction patterns are recorded continuously while scanning the probe. Using this method, the structural and compositional information can be obtained from nanometer-areas in the superlattices by comparing the actual diffraction patterns with the simulated ones.",

        "abstract": "Atom images taken by Crewe with his scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) are much more distinct than those of other authors taken with the conventional transmission electron microscope (CTEM). The reason for the difference in image quality is studied theoretically on the basis of the reciprocity theorem in optics and the results are confirmed by experiments using specimens of gold atoms embedded in BeO films and platinum atoms in carbon films. It is concluded that a STEM with a large annular detector such as used by Crewe has the following three advantages over the CTEM: (1) the background noise due to amorphous supporting films or contamination is smoothed, (2) a higher contrast is obtained by using large angle scattering of electrons, and (3) a higher efficiency for image formation is obtained because of the geometry of the illumination and detection apertures.",

The composite films are found to be composed of epitaxially grown metal crystallites a few nm in size and atomic clusters in MgO single crystals. The growth mechanism is interpreted in a manner similar to that in ordinary vacuum-deposited films, the small difference being the sharp size-distribution due to the co-existence of metal and MgO vapors. The specific resistivity of the films is also measured and analyzed in relation to the discontinuous structures of nm-sized metal crystallites in MgO crystals.",

Several nickel aluminide ordered structures, i.e. L12(Ni3Al)-, B2(NiAl)-, D513(Ni2Al3)- and D020(NiAl3)-type structures, were observed in the deposited films. The L12 and B2 ordered structures became unstable with decreasing grain sizes. The critical grain size on transformation from the L12- and B2-type ordered structures into disordered structures was ca. 5 nm at ambient temperatures. High atomic diffusion, sufficient for grain growth, and an increase in the ordering occurred just above 400\u00b0C in the nanocrystalline Ni-Al films with L12- and B2-type structures. The diffusion bonding process, at ambient temperatures, between Ni-Al nanocrystallites with an L12-type structure was observed dynamically at atomic resolution under strong electron irradiation. It was found that the nanocrystallites rotated and slid without crack generation, and neck-growth proceeded even at ambient temperatures.",

The W-atoms were prepared on single crystalline MgO(001) films at 300\u00b0C by the vacuum deposition of WO 3 or W-metal in a UHV transfer chamber. Analysis of the recorded images revealed the individual jump-process of the W-atoms along the steps at a substrate temperature from room temperature to 400\u00b0C. The diffusion process on terraces and along steps was compared from the viewpoints of the jump distance, dwelling time and local diffusion constant.",

The structure was studied by high-resolution electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The clusters had a b.c.c. structure, but not the A-15 structure which is known as the stable form for small particles of b.c.c. metals. This result is due to the strong interaction between W and MgO(001) substrates. The position of the misfit dislocations at the interface is discussed in relation to the growth centre of the W clusters. Clusters composed of four and five atoms were also detected in the high-resolution images. The image simulation of the clusters suggests that it is possible to determine the adsorption site of W atoms and the inner structure of the clusters from the image contrast.",

The size distribution of the crystals with the A-15 type structure was ranged from 2 to 11 nm and was similar to that of the bcc type structure coexisting in the film, indicating that the nucleation of both structures generated at the same time in the initial stage of growth. The critical grain size of transformation from bcc to A-15 type structure was not observed in the nanometer-sized region. Coalescence of the nanometer-sized crystals with A-15 type structure was observed in the film. It was found that the crystals were connected by stacking faults with displacement vector of 1 2 \u3008100\u3009 and nanometer-sized tilt grain boundaries rotated by 30\u00b0 around the \u3008100\u3009 A-15 axis. It was also implied from the observation that the A-15 structure in the present film was stabilized by some kinds of lattice defects.",

The mean thicknesses of magnesium oxide and metal are 20 to 25 nm and 1 to 3 nm, respectively. All metals except titanium grow epitaxially as small crystallites of a few nm in size inside single crystalline magnesium oxide films, the thickness of metal crystallites being estimated to be a few atomic layers. For iron-magnesium oxide composite films, the transformation from \u03b1-iron to \u03b3-iron is observed by the heat treatment at 500\u00b0C for two hours. For titanium-magnesium oxide composite films, titanium grows as crystallites less than 1 nm in size with the structure of Ti 1\u2212 x O.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is attenuating harmonic sound transmission through symmetric structures into free space using error signals derived from structural vibration sensors. It is well known that structural modal functions of symmetric structures are clustered to an even function or an odd function and each of the clusters uncouples with the other cluster in the radiated acoustic field. This indicates that the clusters are orthogonal contributors, i.e., independent contributors, with respect to the radiated acoustic field. In this paper, the clusters are referred to as \u201cradiation clusters\u201d in contrast with radiation modes, which are conventional orthogonal contributors with respect to the radiated acoustic power. The active control of harmonic sound transmission through symmetric structures into free space based upon independently measuring and controlling the individual radiation clusters, termed \u201cradiation cluster control\u201d, is proposed. The approach falls into a category of middle authority control (MAC), which is between low authority control (LAC): structural modal control and high authority control (HAC): radiation modal control, possessing the benefit of practicality similar to LAC, while providing high control performance and some flexibility of control gain assignment similar to HAC. Specific examples relating to radiation cluster control of a simply supported rectangular plate in an infinite baffle are given.",

It is the purpose of this paper to present the active wave control method of a rectangular panel and to clarify fundamental properties of the control system. Firstly, a transfer matrix method for a rectangular panel is introduced to describe the wave dynamics of the structure. This is followed by the derivation of feedforward control laws for absorbing reflected waves or eliminating transmitted waves. In the proposed method, the control laws are including the modal actuation scheme for uncontrolled direction. Then, from a viewpoint of numerical analyses, basic properties of the proposed method are verified. It is found that the reflected wave absorbing control enables the inactivation of all vibration modes in the controlled direction and the transmitted wave eliminating control enables the generation of an almost vibration-free state. It is also found that some phenomena different from the case of a beam-like structure appear under certain boundary conditions.",

The developed orthogonal functions are generalized, as they are fundamentally acoustic based and thus not constrained to being structural or written in terms of structural measurements. Therefore application can be made to any noise source, facilitating wide practical implementation of the technique. The presented acoustic-centric technique for the sensing and control of enclosure noise, by being based on the fundamental acoustic radiation shape\u2014the monopole, thus overcoming the need for any information of the noise source (other than its approximate size) in the construction of orthogonal functions contributing to the noise within the enclosure. The presented approach then makes a significant improvement over previous work in the area of orthogonal developments for radiation into enclosures, which has typically taken a vibration-centric approach postulating vibration domain measurements to construct the global performance criterion. Therefore providing the hope of moving beyond small-scale laboratory implementations to more practical problems. Simulations are completed to illustrate the validity of the novel approach by illustrating that a controller minimizing the generalized orthogonal functions will achieve the maximum possible attenuation of the global error.",

        "abstract": "Due to the recent advances in microprocessors, active control of a flexible structure has become a realizable method for suppressing the vibration. Conventional modal-based method encounters difficulties in controlling a distributed parameter structure, since such a structure has an infinite number of vibration modes. To overcome this problem, active wave control has been studied in recent years. This paper presents an active wave control of an orthotropic rectangular panel by expanding the conventional active wave control method for a two-dimensional structural case. First, a transfer matrix method for a rectangular panel is introduced to describe the wave dynamics of the structure. This is followed by the derivation of feedforward control laws for absorbing reflected waves or eliminating transmitted waves. In the proposed method, the control laws are including the modal actuation scheme for uncontrolled direction. Then, from a viewpoint of numerical analyses, basic properties of the proposed method are ...",

It is the purpose of this paper to present the wave filtering method for a rectangular cavity using multiple microphones and its application to an adaptive feedforward control system. Firstly, the transfer matrix method is introduced for describing the wave dynamics of the sound field, and then feedforward control laws for eliminating transmitted waves is derived. Furthermore, some numerical simulations are conducted that show the best possible result of active wave control. This is followed by the derivation of the wave filtering equations that indicates the structure of the wave filter. It is clarified that the wave filter consists of three portions; modal group filter, rearrangement filter and wave decomposition filter. Next, from a numerical point of view, the accuracy of the wave decomposition filter which is expressed as a function of frequency is investigated using condition numbers. Finally, an experiment on the adaptive feedforward control system using the wave filter is carried out, demonstrating that a quiet space is generated in the target space by the proposed method.",

The proposed methodology is to independently measure and control the targeted structural modes, which significantly contribute to sound transmission, with structural modal filters, i.e., modal sensors and modal actuators. The targeting is performed by using modal sound transmission coefficients before control as the criteria. The modal sound transmission coefficient enables the contribution from a structural mode to the sound transmission via the modal interaction with the other structural modes to be determined. The structural modal filters effectively facilitate decreasing the sound transmission and guarantee that the structural vibration and near-field sound, side effects of sound transmission control, will not increase. It is shown with numerical examples that sound transmission can be reduced significantly in a broad frequency band by controlling a small number of structural modes and neither the structural vibration nor near-field sound are increased.",

This review looks at how the size range of monolithic silica columns has been expanded, how high-efficiency monolithic silica columns have been realized, and how various methods of silica surface functionalization, leading to selective stationary phases, have been developed on monolithic silica supports, and provides information on the current status of these columns. Also discussed are the practical aspects of monolithic silica columns, including how their versatility can be improved by the preparation of small-sized structural features (sub-micron) and columns (1 mm ID or smaller) and by optimizing reaction conditions for in situ chemical modification with various restrictions, with an emphasis on recent research results for both topics.

During such catalytic reactions, the NPs were observed to move rapidly over the MWCNT surfaces. The mobility and wettability of the NPs varied depending on the particular metal NPs employed and the ambient atmosphere. While rhodium NPs exhibited high wettability under both hydrogen and oxygen atmospheres, the wettability of platinum, palladium and iridium NPs on MWCNTs varied with the atmosphere. The metal NPs seemed to have high degrees of crystallinity while their morphologies fluctuated throughout the catalytic reactions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to directly investigate the grain boundary (GB) hydrogen embrittlement in polycrystalline materials, a novel micro-mechanical testing method was developed. By combining a site-specific sampling technique and a high-voltage environmental transmission electron microscope (HV ETEM), the fracture property of micro-cantilever specimens fabricated from the  same  GB in a nickel-aluminide (Ni 3 Al) polycrystal was critically compared in environments with/without hydrogen (H 2 ) gas. For randomly oriented GBs, brittle fracture nucleation accompanied by plastic deformation was observed in a H 2 -containing environment except for ones with small orientation difference. No GB fracture was observed for coherent \u03a33 boundaries. It also appeared that the similitude of the hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) mechanism was still valid even for the submicron-scale specimens.",

The outer structure of the melanin granule was maintained even after exposure to hair-bleaching agents to decompose the melanin granule, suggesting that the outer structure was a highly robust structure and composition compared with the inner matrix\u00a0.",

We report the generation of an electron Bessel beam using a nanofabricated annular slit. We directly observe that electron Bessel beams propagate while maintaining a narrow beam width over a long propagation distance. In addition, we experimentally verify the self-healing property of these electron beams, which can reconstruct their shape after passing an obstacle. The experimental results are compared with simulation results of the propagation including a hexagonal slit. The present technique of electron Bessel beam generation can be used to develop a novel electron-beam-shaping, an atomic manipulation technique, and a new electron microscopy.",

        "abstract": "The space charge effect has been clearly observed in the energy distributions of picosecond pulse beams from a spin-polarized electron microscope, and was found to depend upon the quantity of charge per pulse. The non-linear phenomena associated with this effect have also been replicated in beam simulations that take into account of a three-dimensional space charge. The results show that a charge of 500\u2009aC/pulse provides the highest brightness with a 16-ps pulse duration, a 30-keV beam energy, and an emission spot of 1.8\u2009\u03bcm. Furthermore, the degeneracy of the wave packet of the pulsed electron beam has been evaluated to be 1.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125 with a charge of 100\u2009aC/pulse, which is higher than that for a continuously emitted electron beam despite the low beam energy of 30\u2009keV. The high degeneracy and high brightness contribute to the realization of high temporal and energy resolutions in low-voltage electron microscopy, which will serve to reduce radiolysis damage and enhance scattering contrast.",

Since the tested monolithic column showed systematically better efficiency for early eluting compounds than the packed columns, an additional band broadening effect was suspected for the packed columns. The effects of the presence of the frits and the bed heterogeneity of the columns near the frits were characterized by a column-reversal method. It has been shown that significant differences - even 20-25% difference in efficiency - can exist between the two ends of the packed columns, while the monolithic column shows rather similar performance at either column end.",

        "abstract": "Extra-column band dispersion during the transport of a sample band from the injector to the column can be reduced by a flow rate program starting with a low flow rate until the sample band has approached to, or just entered into the column, followed by an increased flow rate suitable for the solute separation in the column. Such a sample introduction method increased the plate counts of a 50\u2009mm long column, 1.0 or 2.1\u2009mmID, especially for early-eluting solutes by up to several times compared to a conventional elution method, when a 0.254 mmID, 15.2\u2009cm connection tubing was used. Increase in plate counts of up to 50-70% was possible for solutes with retention factors smaller than 1.0 for the columns connected with a 0.13\u2009mmID, 15\u2009cm tube. The method also seems to reduce the contribution of the void space at the column inlet to the band dispersion. The elution method including a slow transport of the sample band in the pre-column space of 10 \u03bcL or less may require a little longer separation time than normal elution, but it was shown to be effective for increasing the observed efficiency of a small column for solutes with small retention factors.",

        "abstract": "The taste and quality of red wine are determined by its highly complex mixture of polyphenols and many other metabolites. No single method can fully cover the full metabolome, but even for polyphenols and related compounds, current methods proved inadequate. We optimized liquid chromatography resolution and sensitivity using 1 mm i.d. columns with microLC pumps and compared data-dependent to data-independent (SWATH) MS/MS acquisitions. A high-throughput microLC-MS method was developed with a 4 min gradient at 0.05 mL/min flow rate on a Kinetex C18 column and Sciex TripleTOF mass spectrometry. Using the novel software MS-DIAL, we structurally annotated 264 compounds including 165 polyphenols in six commercial red wines by accurate mass MS/MS matching. As proof of concept, multivariate statistics revealed the difference in the metabolite profiles of the six red wines, and regression analysis linked the polyphenol contents to the taste of the red wines.",
