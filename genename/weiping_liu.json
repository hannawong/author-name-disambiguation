The recoil protons were measured by a △E-E counter telescope based on a large area double-sided silicon strip detector at laboratory angles around θ0 = 15°. The excitation function for 12C(p,p) elastic scattering has been obtained over a wide energy range of Ec.m.=0.31—3.45 MeV, which was explained quite well by the R-matrix calculation with known resonance parameters of the first three levels in 13N nucleus. Thus it is demonstrated that the present setup can be directly applied to the study of elastic resonance scattering with secondary radioactive beams.",

        "abstract": "The chirality of herbicides has been the focus of research. However, there is little information on the enantioseparation of amide herbicides with different chiral elements. In this study, the need for different chiral stationary phases (CSPs), mobile phases, temperatures and flow rates for the separation of napropamide, acetochlor and propisochlor was discussed in detail and compared to metolachlor. Resolution of C-chiral enantiomers was easier than that of axial-chiral enantiomers. Metolachlor and acetochlor could achieve baseline separation only on AY-H and AS-H columns, respectively. Propisochlor had satisfactory separations on OD-H and AS-H columns. Napropamide was separated on OJ-H, AY-H and AS-H columns. Both the structures of the compounds and CSPs and the interactions between them played significant roles in the enantioseparations. Molecule dockings were also used to elucidate the separation mechanisms. C-chiral enantiomers had perfect symmetry in their optical properties, whereas the axial-chiral enantiomers did not. The elution order for napropamide, acetochlor and propisochlor, with a single chiral location, was R- prior to S-. These results were the first that compare the enantioseparations of four amide herbicides with different chirality, and they provided the absolute configurations for the herbicides. The paper also illustrated certain mechanisms for enantioseparations.",

        "abstract": "Defect microstructures of minerals are a potential indicator of extremely rapid and episodic exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rock. The microstructure defects in the minerals from UHP jadeite quartzite at Shuanghe, Dabie Mountains, China, have been investigated using transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). TEM observations indicate that three polymorphs, namely, submicron-scale nature monalbite (MA, C 2/ m ) (about 0.8 μm), high albite (HA, C Ī), and low albite (LA, C Ī) occur in jadeite inclusions from jadeite quartzite. The existence of monalbite (MA) implies that high-temperature metamorphism (>930 °C) takes place during exhumation and rapid cooling, during retrogression. The occurrence of nanoscale coesite (about 80 nm) and halite daughter minerals in quartz inclusions provide evidence for the transformation of the original coesite to quartz and the existence of high-salty fluids at peak metamorphic conditions. Structural water (OH/H 2 O) in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) exists in the structures of these minerals as defects. The FTIR results show that the average contents of structural water in jadeite, garnet, rutile, and quartz are 1000 × 10 −6 , (900–1600) × 10 −6 , > 2000 × 10 −6 , and < 4 × 10 −6 , respectively, and the estimated whole-rock water content is (490–600) × 10 −6 . The results reveal that the water in crust or protolith can transport into the earth's depth through NAMs during HP-UHP metamorphism. These unique defect microstructures can be rationalized by a high strain rate at local weakening and deep faulting of continental collision orogens.",

Exposure to 0.5 μM paraquat increased\n the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase to levels 4.93, 3.19, and 3.09 times\n higher, respectively, than those of the control. Furthermore, exposure to 0.75 μM paraquat increased the activities of these\n antioxidant enzymes to even higher levels. The decrease in chlorophyll content and the increases in reactive oxygen species\n (ROS) and malondialdehyde content following exposure to paraquat suggest that the alga was severely damaged and cell growth\n was greatly inhibited. Real-time PCR showed that paraquat reduced the transcript abundance of psaB and rbcL to 7.09 and 29.83% of the control, respectively. Our results demonstrate that paraquat inhibited electron transport and\n CO2 assimilation, and also triggered the synthesis of ROS that disrupt cellular structure and inhibit cell growth.",

        "abstract": "Given its wide distribution in the natural environment and global transport potential, mercury (Hg) is regarded as a ubiquitous pollutant. In this study, we carried out nation-wide sampling campaigns across China to investigate the distribution of Hg in agricultural soils. Concentrations of Hg in the soils collected in 2011 and 2016 ranged from 0.04 to 0.69 and 0.06-0.78 mg kg, respectively. Based on the data from 2016, the reserve of Hg in the surface arable soils (0-20 cm) in China was 4.1 × 10 metric tons and Chinese cultivated soils accounted for 63.4-364 metric tons of Hg released to the global atmosphere. The soil Hg concentrations were significantly higher than the reference background level, highlighting the impacts of anthropogenic activities. The vertical distribution pattern showed a clear enrichment at the surface and a decrease with depth of the soils. Comparison of calculated geo-accumulation indexes among individual provinces showed that Northwest China had higher levels of Hg contamination than other regions of China, likely due to long-term energy related combustions in the area. Soil Hg level showed strong positive correlations with organic matter contents of soil, as well as the mean annual precipitation and temperature of the sampling locations. The non-carcinogenic human health risks of soil Hg were below the threshold level, but the general risk to the ecosystem was considerable. The increases in Hg accumulation from 2011 to 2016 at provincial level were found to relate to coal combustion, power generation and per capita GDP. This examination of energy consumption and socioeconomic drivers for China's soil Hg reserve increase is critical for direct Hg control by guiding policy-making and targets of technology development in era of rapid economic growth.",

        "abstract": "The analysis of microscopic grains within primitive meteorites has revealed isotopic ratios largely characteristic of the conditions thought to prevail in various astrophysical environments. Recently, several grains have been identified with isotopic signatures similar to those predicted within the ejecta of nova explosions on oxygen-neon white dwarfs. A possible smoking gun for a grain of nova origin is a large 33S abundance: nucleosynthesis calculations predict as much as 150 times the solar abundance of 33S in the ejecta of oxygen-neon novae. This overproduction factor may, however, vary by factors of at least 0.01 - 3 because of uncertainties in the 33S(p,γ)34Cl reaction rate over nova temperatures. In addition, better knowledge of this rate would help with the interpretation of nova observations over the S-Ca mass region, and contribute towards the firm establishment of a nucleosynthetic endpoint in these phenomena. Finally, constraining this rate may help to finally confirm or rule out the decay of an isomeric state of 34Cl (Ex = 146 keV, t1/2 =32 min) as a source for observable gamma-rays from novae. Direct examinations of the 33S(p,γ)34Cl reaction in the past have only identified resonances down to Er = 434 keV. At nova temperatures, lower-lying resonances could certainly play a dominant role. Several recent, complementary studies dedicated to improving our knowledge of the 33S(p,γ)34Cl rate, using both indirect methods (measurement of the 34S( 3He,t)34Cl and 33S(3He,d) 34Cl reactions with the Munich Q3D spectrograph) and direct methods (in normal kinematics at CENPA, University of Washington, and in inverse kinematics with the DRAGON recoil mass separator at TRIUMF) are presented here. Our results affect predictions of sulphur isotopic ratios in nova ejecta (e.g. 32S/33S) that may be used as diagnostic tools for the nova paternity of grains. © ?Copyright owned by the author(s).",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the influence of Chinese herbal drugs on serum vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and heart function in patients with myocardial infarction(MI).Methods To divide randomly 54 cases into 3 groups,including the control group with 8 cases(group1),percutaneous transluminal angioplasty(PTCA) group with 22 cases(group2) and Baoxin Decoction group with 24 cases(group3).The concentration of serum VEGF was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent(assay)(ELISA) on 0~(th),1~(st),7~(th),14~(th) and 21~(st) day respectively after the treatment.The colour Doppler(ultrasonic) cardiograph was used for detect the left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) on 1~(st) and 21~(st) day after the treatment. Result The concentration of serum VEGF increased gradually after the beginning of the treatment,reached the peak on 1~(st) day and then decreased gradually.The concentration of serum VEGF was not significant different between group2 and group3 on 0~(th),1~(st),7~(th) and 14~(th) day,but higher than that of group1(P<0.01).On 21~(st) day the concentration of serum VEGF in group3 was higher than that in group2(P<0.01) and obviously higher than that in group1,but there was no significant difference between group2 and group1.On 1~(st) day LVEF was not significant different between group2 and group3 and lower than that in group1(P<0.01).On 21~(st) day LVEF was higher in group3 than that in group2(P<0.05).Conclusion Baoxin Decoction can promote the collateralization in ischemic zone,protect cardiac muscle and improve the recovery of heart function through regulating the VEGF expression and keep VEGF a suitable serum concentration.",

The complexes exist in equilibrium between two position isomeric forms and undergo hydrolysis reaction in aqueous solution, releasing the platinum pharmacophores and dichloroacetate which is a small-molecular cell apoptosis inducer. Both complexes were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic profile in A549, SGC-7901 and SK-OV-3 cancer cells as well as in BEAS-2B normal cells. They exhibit markedly cytotoxicity toward cancer cells by selectively inducing the apoptosis of cancer cells, whereas leaving normal cells less affected. They have also the ability to overcome the resistance of SK-OV-3 cancer cells to cisplatin. Our findings offer an alternative novel way to develop platinum drugs which can both overcome the drug resistance and selectively target tumor cells.",

When the surfactant of SDBS was added, the fluorescence intensity of the system was greatly increased. From this, a sensitive method of determining the ciprofloxacin was developted. The fluorescence intensity was determined by a 1 cm quartz cell with the excitation wavelength of 300 nm and the emission wavelength of 545 nm. The optimal conditions are as follows: pH 8.0-8.5, the concentration of terbium(III) is 5.0 x 10(-5) mol x L(-1), the surfactant concentration of SDBS is 8.0 x 10(-4) mol x L(-1). The linear range is 2.5 x 10(-6) mol x L(-1) -2.0 x 10(-8) mol x L(-1), and the detection limit (S/N = 3) is 4.0 x 10(-9) mol x L(-1).

        "abstract": "Nornicotine is a natural alkaloid produced by plants in the genus Nicotiana and is structurally related to nicotine. Importantly, nornicotine is the direct precursor of tobacco-specific nitrosamine N'-nitrosonornicotine, which is a highly potent human carcinogen. Microbial detoxification and degradation of nicotine have been well characterized; however, until now, there has been no information on the molecular mechanism of nornicotine degradation. In this study, we demonstrate the transformation of nornicotine by the nicotine-degrading strain Shinella sp. HZN7. Three transformation products were identified as 6-hydroxy-nornicotine, 6-hydroxy-myosmine, and 6-hydroxy-pseudooxy-nornicotine by UV spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy analyses. The two-component nicotine dehydrogenase genes nctA1 and nctA2 were cloned, and their product, NctA, was confirmed to be responsible for the conversion of nornicotine into 6-hydroxy-nornicotine as well as nicotine into 6-hydroxy-nicotine. The 6-hydroxy-nicotine oxidase, NctB, catalyzed the oxidation of 6-hydroxy-nornicotine to 6-hydroxy-myosmine, and it spontaneously hydrolyzed into 6-hydroxy-pseudooxy-nornicotine. However, 6-hydroxy-pseudooxy-nornicotine could not be further degraded by strain HZN7. This study demonstrated that nornicotine is partially transformed by strain HZN7 via nicotine degradation pathway.",

        "abstract": "According to the electrophilic theory in toxicology, many chemical carcinogens in the environment and/or their active metabolites are electrophiles that exert their effects by forming covalent bonds with nucleophilic DNA centers. The theory of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB), which states that a toxic electrophile reacts preferentially with a biological macromolecule that has a similar hardness or softness, clarifies the underlying chemistry involved in this critical event. Epoxides are hard electrophiles that are produced endogenously by the enzymatic oxidation of parent chemicals (e.g., alkenes and PAHs). Epoxide ring opening proceeds through a SN2-type mechanism with hard nucleophile DNA sites as the major facilitators of toxic effects. Thus, the quantitative prediction of chemical reactivity would enable a predictive assessment of the molecular potential to exert electrophile-mediated toxicity. In this study, we calculated the activation energies for reactions between epoxides and the guanine N7 ...",

        "abstract": "Chiral pollutants are receiving growing environmental concern due to differential biological activities of their enantiomers. In the present study, enantiomeric separation of the pyrethroid insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the columns of Chiralpak AD (amylase tris[3,5-dimethyl-phenyl carbamate]), Chiralpak AS (amylase tris[(S)-1-phenyl carbamate]), Chiralcel OD (cellulose tris[3,5-dimethylphenyl carbamate]), and Chiralcel OJ (cellulose tris[4-methyl benzoate]) with different chiral stationary phases. The differential toxicities of the enantiomers in aquatic systems were evaluated using the acute zebrafish (Danio rerio) toxicity test and the zebrafish embryo test. The enantiomers of LCT were separated completely on all the columns tested and detected by circular dichroism at 236 nm. Better separations were achieved at lower temperatures (e.g., 20 degrees C) and lower levels of polar modifiers (</=5%) in mobile phase. Ethanol was found to be a good modifier of the mobile phase for all the columns, although isopropanol acted better for the Chiralcel OD column. The (-)-enantiomer was >162 times more toxic than its antipode to zebrafish in the acute test. The embryo test indicated that the exposure to LCT enantioselectively induced crooked body, yolk sac edema, and pericardial edema and that the (-)-enantiomer was 7.2 times stronger than the (+)-enantiomer in 96-h mortality. The malformations were induced by the racemate and its (-)-enantiomer at lower concentrations tested (e.g., 50 microg L(-1)), whereas the (+)-enantiomer induced malformations at relatively higher concentrations (>/=100 microg L(-1)). These results suggest that the toxicological effects of chiral pesticides must be evaluated using their individual enantiomers.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is suspected to interfere with fetal development including reproductive and thyroid function and birth outcomes, but published evidence are still sparse. We designed a cross-sectional study to analyze the associations between PCB levels in umbilical cord sera and hormones and birth outcomes of mothers and newborns who are residents from an island. Seven indicator-PCB (PCB-28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180), and five reproductive hormones including luteotropic hormones (LH), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH) and anti-Mullerian hormones (AMH), and three thyroid hormones including tri-iodothyronine (T3), tetra-iodothyronine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormones (TSH) were measured in 106 cord sera specimens. Birth outcomes include birth weight, length, head circumference, and gestational age. Multiple linear regression and quartile regression were used to analyze the associations between PCB and each of the hormones and birth outcomes, adjusting for selected potential confounders. The median value of total PCB in umbilical cord sera was 2.02 μg L (IQR, 1.13-4.64). Several negative associations between PCB exposure and reproductive hormones were found. Among them, the β value of PCB-101 for FSH reached -0.38 (95%CI, -0.69, -0.07; p = 0.02). Moreover, we also found some sex-specific associations i.e. PCB-28 was negatively correlated with LH and T and PCB-118 was negatively correlated with T in male newborns but not in female newborns. The associations between PCB and birth outcomes seem to differ by molecular weight of the PCB congeners i.e. the low-chlorinated PCB congeners were negatively associated with gestational age and head circumference while high-chlorinated PCB congeners were positively associated birth weight and gestational age. In this study, we found that PCB congeners with different molecular weight has different associations with hormones and birth outcomes, and future studies are recommended to investigate underlying mechanisms of these associations.",

        "abstract": "The asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) for the virtual decay 17O→16O+n are derived from the angular distributions of the 16O(d,p)17O reaction leading to the ground and first excited states of 17O, respectively, using the distorted wave Born approximation and the adiabatic wave approximation. The ANCs of 17F are then extracted according to charge symmetry of mirror nuclei and used to calculate the astrophysical S-factors of 16O(p,γ) 17F leading to the first two states of 17F. The present results are in good agreement with those from the direct measurement. This provides a test of this indirect method to determine direct astrophysical S-factors of (p,γ) reaction. In addition, the S-factors at zero energy for the direct captures to the ground and first excited states of 17F are presented, without the uncertainty associated with the extrapolation from higher energies in direct measurement. ©2007 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The robust nature of the manganese(I) catalysis regime was reflected by the first C-H/C-C functionalization on amino acids under racemization-free reaction conditions.

In addition, angular distribution for 7Li + 13C elastic scattering is also measured. The optical potential parameters for the entrance and exit channels of the transfer reactions are derived by fitting the 7Li + 13C and 6Li + 14N elastic scattering experimental data, and their angular distributions are well reproduced by the distorted wave Born approximation calculations.

        "abstract": "Four new diam(m)ine platinum complexes containing the dichloroacetate moiety in 3-dichoroacetoxylcyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylate as the leaving group were synthesized, characterized by elemental analysis as well as by ESI(+)-MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in positive mode), FT-IR, (1)H- and (13)C-NMR, and evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity against human lung cancer cell line (A549) and ovarian cancer cell lines (SK-OV-3, SK-OV-3/DDP). Diam(m)ines used in the present study belong to the carriers of six clinically approved platinum drugs. Among the complexes synthesized, complex 2, cis-[Pt(II)(1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane)·(3-dichoroacetoxylcyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylate)] is the most promising in terms of water solubility and potential of being totally devoid of cross-drug resistance with cisplatin. Therefore, complex 2 was selected for the dichloroacetate release test. The test shows dichloroacetate can be efficiently released from complex 2 under physiological conditions via the hydrolysis of an ester bond bridging the dichloroacetate moiety and platinum pharmacophores together. Our study supports the further evaluation of this complex as a drug candidate.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive spatio-vertical survey of short-chain (SCCPs, C) and medium-chain (MCCPs, C) chlorinated paraffins (CPs) was performed in surface and core soils from Chinese nation-wide agricultural lands in 2016, and a total of 48 congener groups were measured. The shorter carbon chain C in SCCP and C in MCCP homologue groups, and the lower chlorinated congeners (Cl) for both CP groups were predominant. The ∑SCCP and ∑MCCP concentrations in surface soils ranged from 39 to 1609 ng/g and 127-1969 ng/g, dry weight (dw), respectively. The spatial distribution trend showed that SCCP congener groups with relatively low octanol-water partition coefficient (K) and octanol-air partition coefficient (K) are uniformly distributed across surface soils compared to MCCP congener groups. Significant relationships were observed between the spatial variation of SCCP concentrations and the driving factors responsible for dispersion and deposition. The distribution behavior of SCCPs and MCCPs in highland and plain surface soils showed an increasing trend of MCCP concentrations with elevation, indicating the \"mountain cold-trapping effect\". Vertical distribution profile revealed similar homologue group composition patterns of SCCP and MCCP congener groups as those of surface soils. Furthermore, the penetration potential ratios (r) of chlorine and carbon atoms of CPs demonstrated that the lower chlorinated (Cl) and the shorter carbon chain (C) congener groups are more prone to vertical movement into deeper soil layers compared to the longer carbon chain (C) and highly chlorinated (Cl) congener groups.",

Our result is in agreement with that from the 14N(12N,13O) 13C reaction and two shell model calculations. We also measured the angular distributions of single neutron transfer reaction of 7Li(6Li,7Li)6Li, and derived the reaction cross section for 6Li(n,γ)7Li by using the present spectroscopic factor. The astrophysical reaction rate is found to be higher by a factor of 1.7 than the value adopted in previous reaction network calculations. In addition, half-life of 147Sm in metal samarium and Sm2O3 was measured. No significant change has been observed within the experimental uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Potential adverse effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in human and wildlife have become a major research topic. However, little is known about the effects of ambient conditions, including temperature and photoperiod, on endocrine disruption in zebrafish. We found that zebrafish hepatic estrogen-responsive gene transcription levels were greatly affected by temperature and photoperiod. Estrogen-responsive gene transcription levels at higher temperatures and with longer photoperiods were significantly higher than those at lower temperatures and with shorter photoperiods upon exposure to 17beta-estradiol (E2) or nonylphenol (NP). Specifically, mRNA expression levels of vitellogenin 1 (vtg1) and vitellogenin 2 (vtg2) induced by both E2 and NP at high temperature (30 degrees C) were approximately 2-10 and 1.5-2.5 times higher than those exposed to low temperature (20 degrees C) under identical photoperiod conditions. mRNA expression levels of vtg1, vtg2 and estrogen receptor alpha (esralpha) with a long photoperiod (16L) were also several folds higher than those with a short photoperiod (8L) upon exposure to E2 and NP at both high and low temperatures. Two-way analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction between temperature and photoperiod in hepatic vtg1 and esralpha gene transcription in both high and low concentration treatment groups upon exposure to E2. However, no significant interactions were found for hepatic estrogen-responsive gene transcription at either NP concentrations. These results suggest that temperature and photoperiod could confound the risk assessment of estrogenic chemicals, and they also have potential implications for future environmental monitoring studies.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease. The prognostic factor currently used is not accurate enough to predict the outcomes of patients with DLBCL. The prognostic significance of interim PET/CT in DLBCL remains controversial. The aim of this study is to determine the predictive value of interim 18F-FDG PET/CT after first-line treatment in patients with DLBCL. Methods: Thirty-two patients with DLBCL underwent baseline, interim and post-treatment 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Imaging results were analyzed for the survival of patients via software SPSS 13.0, retrospectively. Results: Thirty-one of the 32 patients were treated with R-CHOP regimen, and interim 18F-FDG PET/CT of 24 patients was performed after 2 cycles of treatment. After a median follow-up period of 16.7 months, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were significantly different between the groups above and below SUVmax cut-off value of 2.5 (P=0.039). No significant differences were found in the 2-year PFS rates if SUVmax cut-off values were set as 2.0 and 3.0, respectively (P=0.360; P=0.113). Conclusions: Interim PET/CT could predict the prognosis of DLBCL patients with the SUVmax cut-off value of 2.5, but more clinical data should be concluded to confirm this conclusion. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

The effects of ATZ exposure on the induction of oxidative stress and the alteration of gene expression were studied in liver and ovary samples from female zebrafish (Danio rerio). Antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and CAT), in addition to the GSH and MDA content, in the liver altered significantly; the mRNA levels for the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, such as Cu/Zn-Sod, Mn-Sod, Cat, and Gpx, were up-regulated significantly in the liver when zebrafish were exposed to various concentrations of ATZ for 14d. However, the mRNA induction patterns were not in accordance with those of antioxidant enzyme changes in the liver and ovary. Moreover, the transcriptional expression of mitochondrial inner membrane genes related to ROS production, such as Ucp-2 and Bcl-2, were altered significantly in high ATZ treatment groups. However, the ATZ treatment did not induce any apparent changes in the transcriptional expression of CoxI, Ndi, or ATPo6, which are related to the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report to study the transcriptional effects of ATZ stress on zebrafish. The information presented in this study will be helpful in fully understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress induced by ATZ in fish.",

The Pt(II) is in a square planar environment and is coordinated in cis position by a chelating HO-pda and 2Cl(-) for 1 and CBDCA for 4 and 5. Pt-N, Pt-Cl and Pt-O distances and coordinate bond angles of N-Pt-N, Cl-Pt-Cl and O-Pt-O are in the normal range. There are two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of 5, held together by intermolecular hydrogen bonded chain. All the complexes show significant cytotoxicity on the sensitive cell lines SGC-7901, LNcap and A549, and are more active than carboplatin. 4 is also found to be active against the resistant cell A549/ATCC, which suggests that it has less cross-resistance with cisplatin than carboplatin. Moreover 4 shows much greater inhibition of tumor growth than carboplatin in S180-bearing mice, and is therefore worthy of further development as a potential anti-tumor platinum drug.",

        "abstract": "The increased release of chiral persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment has resulted in more attention to the role of enantioselectivity in the fate and ecotoxicological effects of these compounds. Although the enantioselectivity of chiral POPs has been considered in previous studies, little effort has been expended to discern the enantiospecific effects of chiral POPs metabolites, which may impede comprehensive risk assessments of these chemicals. In the present study, o,p'-DDD, the chiral metabolite of o,p'-DDT, was used as a model chiral metabolite. First, a preferential chiral separation at 100% ethanol was employed to obtain a pure enantiomer. The enantioselective cytotoxicity of o,p'-DDD in rat cells (PC12) was evaluated by detecting activation of the cellular apoptosis and oxidative stress systems and microarray analysis. We have documented for the first time that R-(+)-o,p'-DDD increases apoptosis by selectively disturbing the oxidative system (enzymes and molecules) and regulating the transcription of Aven, Bid, Cideb and Tp53. By comparing the data from the present study to data derived from the parent compound, we concluded that the R-enantiomer is the more detrimental stereostructure for both o,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDD. This observed stereostructural effect is in line with the structure-activity relationship formulated at other structural levels. Biological activities of the chiral metabolites are likely to occur in the same absolute configuration between chiral POPs and their metabolites provided that they have the similar stereostructures.",

Here we generated a new anti-CD19 CAR molecule (CD19-BBz(86)) derived from the CD19-BBz prototype bearing co-stimulatory 4-1BB and CD3ζ domains. We found that CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cells produced lower levels of cytokines, expressed higher levels of antiapoptotic molecules and proliferated more slowly than the prototype CD19-BBz CAR T cells, although they retained potent cytolytic activity. We performed a phase 1 trial of CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cell therapy in patients with B cell lymphoma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02842138 ). Complete remission occurred in 6 of 11 patients (54.5%) who each received a dose of 2 × 10-4 × 10 CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cells. Notably, no neurological toxicity or CRS (greater than grade 1) occurred in any of the 25 patients treated. No significant elevation in serum cytokine levels after CAR T cell infusion was detected in the patients treated, including in those who achieved complete remission. CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cells persistently proliferated and differentiated into memory cells in vivo. Thus, therapy with the new CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cells produces a potent and durable antilymphoma response without causing neurotoxicity or severe CRS, representing a safe and potent anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy.",

METHODS: With adenosine diphosphate the effects of CuAsp on platelet aggregation in vitro or in vivo were investigated. Radioimmunoassay and fluorophotometry were used to measure thromboxane B2 (TXB2) generation from platelets, the levels of TXB2 and of 6-keto- PGF(1��) in plasma and the platelet serotonin release reaction. RESULTS: In vitro, CuAsp inhibited arachidonic acid (AA)-induced aggregation (IC50 = 17 ��mol �� L-1 95 % confidence limits: 9 - 33 ��mol �� L-1), the release of 5-HT (IC50 = 19 ��mol �� L-1, 95 % confidence limits: 10 - 30 ��mol �� L-1), and TXB2 generation from platelets (P < 0.05). CuAsp 10 mg �� kg- 1 ig selectively inhibited AA-induced aggregation, and increased the 6- keto-PGF(1��) concentration in plasma while decreased that of TXB2. CONCLUSION: CoAsp, in vitro or in vivo, shows more potent inhibitory effects on AA-induced aggregation than aspirin (Asp), related to the inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and the release of active substances from platelets.",

        "abstract": "Acetochlor (ACT) is a chiral chloroacetamide pesticide that has been heavily used around the world, resulting in its residues being frequently found in surface waters. It has been reported that ACT is an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) with strong thyroid hormone-disrupting activity in aquatic organisms. However, the enantioselectivity underlying thyroid disruption has yet to be understood. In this study, using a zebrafish embryo-larvae model, the enantioselective thyroid disruption of ACT was investigated at a series of environmentally relevant concentrations (1, 2, 10 and 50 μg/L). Our results showed that both racemic ACT and its enantiomers significantly increased the malformation rates of embryos at 72 h postfertilization (hpf). Decreased thyroxine (T) contents and increased triiodothyronine (T) contents were found in larvae at 120 hpf, with (+)-S-ACT exhibiting a greater effect than (-)-R-enantiomer. Similarly, (+)-S-ACT also showed a stronger effect on the mRNA expressions of thyroid hormone receptors (TRα and TRβ), deiodinase2 (Dio2) and thyroid-stimulating hormone-β (TSHβ) genes. The observed enantioselectivity in TR expressions was consistent with that of in silico binding analysis, which suggested that (+)-S-enantiomer binds more potently to the TRs than (-)-R-enantiomer. In general, ACT enantiomers showed different influences on the secretion of THs, expression of TH-related key genes and binding affinity to TRs. Considering the different toxicity of different enantiomers, our study highlights the importance of enantioselectivity in understanding of thyroid disruption effects of chiral pesticides.",

        "abstract": "A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet detection method, combined with solid-phase extraction (SPE), was developed for the determination of five nitroaniline and dinitroaniline isomers including 2-nitroaniline, 3-nitroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitroaniline and 2,6-dinitroaniline in wastewater samples. Extraction of the five isomers was carried out with a hydrophile-lipophile balance cartridge, the Oasis HLB. The cartridge was washed by a mixed aqueous solution containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile and 10% (v/v) ethyl acetate before the five isomers were eluted by a mixture of methanol and acetic acid. Separation of the five isomers was achieved by using an Agilent TC-C(18) column at 30°C, and using a mixture of acetonitrile/water 30/70 (v/v) as mobile phase under an isocratic condition at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The analytes were detected by a UV detector at a wavelength of 225 nm. Recoveries of the five isomers in the spiked sewage sample were between 84.6% and 94.0% with a relative standard deviation of less than 4.7%. The limits of quantification (LOQ) determined in a spiked sewage sample of 500 mL were 2.0 x 10(-9)M for 2-nitroaniline, 3-nitroaniline and 2,6-dinitroaniline, and 4.5 x 10(-9)M for 4-nitroaniline and 2,4-dinitroaniline. The proposed method was applied to determine the five isomers in real samples of acidic wastewater and printing and dyeing wastewater.",

        "abstract": "Tree bark is considered as an effective passive sampler for estimating the atmospheric status of pollutants. In this study, we conducted a national scale tree bark sampling campaign across China. Concentration profiles revealed that Eastern China, especially the Jing-Jin-Ji region (including Hebei Province, Beijing and Tianjin) was a hot spot of bark DDT pollution. The enantioselective accumulation of o,p'-DDT was observed in most of the samples and 68% of them showed a preferential depletion of (+)-o,p'-DDT. These results suggest that DDTs in rural bark are likely from combined sources including historical technical DDTs and fresh dicofol usage. The tree bulk DDT levels were found to correlate with soil DDT concentrations, socioeconomy and PM of the sampling sites. It thus becomes evident that the reemission from soils and subsequent atmospheric deposition were the major pathways leading to the accumulation of DDTs in bark. Based on a previously established bark-air partitioning model, the concentrations of DDTs in the air were estimated from measured concentrations in tree bark, and the results were comparable to those obtained by the use of passive sampling with polyurethane foam (PUF) disks. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of delineating the spatial variations in atmospheric concentration and tracing sources of DDTs by integrating the use of tree bark with enantiomeric analysis.",

        "abstract": "Enantioselectivity in the separation, toxicology, biodegradation and estrogenic activity of chiral pesticides has become a groundbreaking topic recently. In this study, real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was adapted to investigate the induction of estrogen-responsive gene expression in embryo-larval zebrafish after 7 d of exposure to permethrin (PM) enantiomers. The PM enantiomers were completely separated by a chiral HPLC column. The in vivo study found that a 7 d exposure to 250 ng L(-1) PM racemate and its enantiomers was sufficient to stimulate vtg1, esralpha and cyp19b expression, while 1000 ng L(-1) exposure significantly induced gene expression in a pattern similar to that of the control (50 ng L(-1) E2), except for vtg2. Significant differences were detected between the enantiomers in the induction of estrogen-responsive gene expression. At the exposure level of 1000 ng L(-1), the vtg1, esralpha and cyp19b responses to the (-)-trans enantiomer were about 3.2-, 1.8- and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, than those in the group treated with (+)-trans enantiomer (p < 0.05). In the two cis-enantiomer treatment groups, (+)-cis increased the mRNA level of the cyp19b gene about 1.5-fold higher than the (-)-cis-enantiomer did. Of the four enantiomers, the (-)-trans enantiomer showed the greatest estrogenic activity. The results strongly indicate the occurrence of significant enantioselectivity in estrogenic activity of PM enantiomers exposed to embryo-larval zebrafish. These findings add to a growing body of evidence concerning enantioselectivity in the toxicity, endocrine-disrupting activity, and environmental biodegradation of chiral pesticides.",

The 6.356 MeV 1/2+ subthreshold resonance in 17O plays an important role in the 13C(��,n)16O reaction. The 13C(11B, 7Li)17O angular distributions were measured using HI-13 tandem accelerator and Q3D magnetic spectrograph, and then used to determine the ��-width of the subthreshold resonant state which is currently the most uncertain parameter for determining the 13C(��,n)16O reaction rate. By using the present ��-width, the astrophysical S-factor and the stellar rate of the 13C(��,n)16O reaction were derived. This shed some light on the existing discrepancies up to a factor of 25 in S-factors derived from different authors. The simulation of s-process in AGB stars shows that the new reaction rate produces 25% more Pb than the CF88 compilation.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies showed that bis(α-furancarboxylato)oxovanadium(IV) (BFOV), an orally active antidiabetic organic vanadium complex, could improve insulin resistance in animals with type 2 diabetes. The present study has been carried out to evaluate the effects of BFOV on insulin-resistant glucose metabolism using dexamethasone-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes as an in-vitro model of insulin resistance. The results showed that BFOV, similar to vanadyl sulfate and rosiglitazone, caused a concentration-dependent increase in glucose consumption by insulin-resistant adipocytes. Moreover, BFOV enhanced the action of insulin and completely prevented the development of insulin resistance induced by dexamethasone, leading to glucose consumption equal to that by normal cells. In addition, dexamethasone reduced the mRNA expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, while BFOV normalized the expression of IRS-1 and GLUT4. These findings suggest that BFOV prevents and improves dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by enhancing expression of IRS-1 and GLUT4 mRNA. © 2008 The Authors.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the concentrations, size-specific distributions, and preliminary exposure assessments of 10 organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were investigated in suspended particulate matter collected from offices. OPFRs were detected in a range of 5.00-147.77 ng/m(3). Tri(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP) was the most abundant analog followed by tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPhP). Chlorinated OPFRs (TCPP, TCEP, and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCPP)) contributed to about 77% of the total OPFRs. Size-specific distributions revealed that TCEP, tri-n-propyl phosphate (TnPP), TCPP, and tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) shared a similar distribution pattern with a peak in the fraction 4.7-5.8 μm. A peak was also found in the distributions of tricresyl phosphate (TCrP), 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP), and tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) but in different fractions. A bimodal distribution was observed for TDCPP, TPhP, and tributoxyethyl phosphate (TBEP). The results of mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) indicated that TDCPP, TCrP, and TEHP were mainly located on ultrafine particles (≤1 μm), while TnPP, TBEP, and EHDPP mainly on fine particles (≤2.5 μm). Furthermore, MMADs of OPFRs were found to be positively correlated with their vapor pressures (Vp) (p < 0.01), indicating that OPFR analogs with low Vp were inclined to adsorb on small size particles. Preliminary exposure assessments suggested a low risk of exposure to OPFRs for people working in such offices, and inhaled OPFRs would mainly deposit in the head region of the respiratory tract.",

Method: Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with dexamethasone to induce insulin resistance. Effects of bis (α-furancarboxylato) oxovanadium (IV) on the glucose uptake in normal and insulin-resistant adipocytes were estimated by the changes of glucose consumption in the medium measured by the glucose oxidase method. Results BFOV (2.5 - 40 μmol · L-1) produced the tendency of increasing the glucose consumption in normal cells, compared with untreated control cells (P > 0.05). However, BFOV markedly enhanced the glucose consumption in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes, resulting in the improvement of insulin resistance induced by dexamethasone. Conclusion: BFOV increased the glucose uptake in insulin-resistant adipocytes, suggesting the improvement of insulin resistance.",

Unfortunately, despite increasing research efforts in the field of removal efficiency, whether this kind of complex can reduce Cr(VI) to less-toxic Cr(III) and what are the mechanisms of detoxification processes are still unknown. In this study, despite the highly adsorption efficiency (maximum adsorption capacity of 173.1 mg/g in 10 min), the significant improvement of Cr(VI) reduction by chitosan-Fe(III) complex compared with normal crosslinked chitoan has been demonstrated. In addition, the structure of chitosan-Fe(III) complex and its functional groups concerned with Cr(VI) detoxification have been characterized by the powerful spectroscopic techniques X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra indicated that the primary alcoholic function on C-6 served as an electron donor during Cr(VI) reduction and was oxidized to a carbonyl group. The X-ray adsorption near edge spectra (XANES) of the Cr(VI)-treated chitosan-Fe(III) complex revealed the similar geometrical arrangement of Cr species as that in Cr(III)-bound chitosan-Fe(III). Overall, a possible process and mechanism for highly efficient detoxification of Cr(VI) by chitosan-Fe(III) complex has been elucidate.",

Whether it is significant depends on the reactions involved, one of the important reactions is the 11C p-capture competing with its β+ decay. The S factor for the 11C (p,γ)12N direct capture was obtained in our previous work. This work is to update the reaction rate by adding uncertainty and fitting with the Thielemann format.

        "abstract": "The stability of novel anticancer platinum complex in solution, named as cis-3,5-diisopropylsalici-lyco-(lR,2R-cyclodiamino) Pt( II ), or SM 54111 for short, was investigated. The platinum complex was designed, synthesized, and characterized by element analysis, coupled inductively plasma mass spectrometry, gravitational thermal-differential thermal analysis, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrometry, infrared specos-copy, fast atom bombment mass spectrometry and H nuclear magnetic resonance, etc. High performance capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry(HPCE-ESI-MS n) was employed to separate the platinum complex and the possible products of dissociation, to identify and quantify as well. It shows that this novel compound remains prototype at the range of pH 5. 0-9. 0. At pH value lower than 5. 0, SM54111 disassociates by clearage producing monodentate platinum complex which was detected and identified with ESI-MS n. A type of novel cleavage was obtained by the compound tested, which indicated that the ionization rate depended on the ionization codition. It was proved that SM54111's stability at physiological pH in solution was demonstrated and HPCE-ESI-MS/MS was a convenient and useful tool for the analysis of platinum complex. The results offered the method and reference for the study on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of SM54111.",

It was found that the water contents aren't uniform in NAMs from different areas to the same area, and from the different grains at the same area to the different position in the same grain. The structural water contents of the omphacites at Shima and Yingshan are respectively from (90-1670) ×10 -6 and from (110-710)×10 -6; while the garnets' are from (510-830)×10 -6 and (0-180)×10 -6.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown the enantioselectivity of chiral pesticides in environmental fate, aquatic toxicity, endocrine disruption and cytotoxicity. Thus it is of significance to investigate the molecular mechanisms of chiral pesticides enantioselectivity in cytotoxicity. In the present study, we used Hep G2 cells as in vitro model to assay cytotoxicity of enantiomers of isocarbophos (ICP), a widely used chiral organophosphorus pesticide. The results of cell viability assay and cytoflow assay indicated an obvious enantioselective hepatocyte toxicity of ICP: (-)-ICP was about two times more toxic than (+)-ICP in Hep G2 cells. We found that (-)-ICP, but not (+)-ICP, up-regulated Bax protein expression and down-regulated Bcl-2 expression levels, which resulted in an increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio with the apoptosis co-ordination. Although (-)-ICP enantioselectively activated both ERK and JNK, only the specific inhibitor for JNK could completely reverse (-)-ICP-induced apoptosis of Hep G2 cells. It suggests that (-)-ICP-induced hepatocyte toxicity was more dominantly through the sustained activation of JNK pathway, but only partially via ERK cascade. Furthermore, (-)-ICP induced ROS production, while (+)-ICP had no effect on ROS generation. The antioxidant MnTBAP attenuated (-)-ICP-induced activation of JNK and ERK, indicating that the outcome from challenge with (-)-ICP enantiomer depends on the oxidative stress-induced activation of a series of signaling cascades that promote hepatocyte apoptosis. In conclusion, (-)-ICP enantioselectively causes the change of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, triggers the generation of intracellular ROS and sequentially induces sustainable activation of JNK, which in turn, results in a decrease in cell viability and an increase in cell apoptosis. Our observations provide further insight into enantiomers toxicity pathway which is able to differentiate between enantiomer activities at molecular level.",

        "abstract": "Large amounts of hexaclorocyclohexanes (HCHs) were historically applied to Chinese soils. However, there has been limited information on the residue patterns of HCHs in soils at a national scale in China. In this study, surface soil samples were collected from agricultural fields across China, and the concentrations of HCHs and enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of α-HCH were measured. The results showed that the average concentrations of α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, and total HCHs in Chinese agricultural soils were 0.190, 1.31, 0.236, and 1.74 ng g(-1), respectively. Residues of HCHs likely originated from past usage of technical HCHs. The isomers of α-HCH and γ-HCH tended to accumulate in the sites with lower total HCH concentrations, lower temperature, higher elevation, and less wet precipitation when compared to β-HCH. Enantiomeric analysis showed a preferential degradation of (-)-α-HCH. Human health risks via various exposure routes to HCHs in soils were further estimated. Overall, the mean hazard index (HI) linked to noncarcinogenic risks was below 1, suggesting an absence of noncarcinogenic risks of HCHs in Chinese soils. In addition, the cancer risk values were all below 10(-4), which indicates low or very low risks.",

        "abstract": "Increasing attention was paid to the problem of pesticide pollution by people. Risk assessment of pesticide should not be only based on the chemical analysis of environmental samples,since this method could't truly distinguish whether the pesticide was harmful to environment. Thus,biological assessment system should be established. Earthworms were widely used to evaluate the pesticide pollution owing to its large number in soil ecosystem and its role as the bottom of food chain. The changes of earthworm biomarkers measured at the molecular or cellular level could be used to discern agricultural chemical pollution at earlier time. Based on the history of biomarker,earthworm could be used as the model organism to evaluate the soil ecological risk of pesticides. According to this characteristic of earthworm,some kinds of earthworm biomarker (such as acetylcholinesterase,antioxidant enzymes,immunocyte and gene expression) were discussed on its assessment of the pesticide contamination level and its action mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The enantiomers of a chiral compound possess different biological activities, and one of the enantiomers usually shows a higher level of toxicity. Therefore, the exploration of the causative mechanism of enantioselective toxicity is regarded as one of primary goals of biological chemistry. Imazethapyr (IM) is an acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting chiral herbicide that has been widely used in recent years with racemate. We investigated the enantioselectivity between R- and S-IM to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to regulate antioxidant gene transcription and enzyme activity.Dramatic differences between the enantiomers were observed: the enantiomer of R-IM powerfully induced ROS formation, yet drastically reduced antioxidant gene transcription and enzyme activity, which led to an oxidative stress. The mechanism by which IM affects carbohydrate metabolism in chloroplasts has long remained a mystery. Here we report evidence that enantioselectivity also exists in starch metabolism. The enantiomer of R-IM resulted in the accumulation of glucose, maltose and sucrose in the cytoplasm or the chloroplast and disturbed carbohydrates utilization.The study suggests that R-IM more strongly retarded plant growth than S-IM not only by acting on ALS, but also by causing an imbalance in the antioxidant system and the disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism with enantioselective manner.",

        "abstract": "We present a new measurement of the α-spectroscopic factor (S α) and the asymptotic normalization coefficient for the 6.356MeV 1/2 + subthreshold state of 17O through the 13C( 11B, 7Li) 17O transfer reaction and we determine the α-width of this state. This is believed to have a strong effect on the rate of the 13C(α, n) 16O reaction, the main neutron source for slow neutron captures (the s-process) in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Based on the new width we derive the astrophysical S-factor and the stellar rate of the 13C(α, n) 16O reaction. At a temperature of 100 MK, our rate is roughly two times larger than that by Caughlan & Fowler and two times smaller than that recommended by the NACRE compilation. We use the new rate and different rates available in the literature as input in simulations of AGB stars to study their influence on the abundances of selected s-process elements and isotopic ratios. There are no changes in the final results using the different rates for the 13C(α, n) 16O reaction when the 13C burns completely in radiative conditions. When the 13C burns in convective conditions, as in stars of initial mass lower than ∼2 M ⊙ and in post-AGB stars, some changes are to be expected, e.g., of up to 25% for Pb in our models. These variations will have to be carefully analyzed when more accurate stellar mixing models and more precise observational constraints are available. © 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

The study covered US EPA priority pollutants but also several non-priority isomers including some dibenzopyrenes which are expected to have higher toxic potentials. The total PAH concentrations varied extensively from 8.8 to 3880 μg/kg, with a geometric mean of 158 μg/kg. There were significant differences in both the concentrations and composition profiles between the south and the north regions. The overall geographical distribution pattern was strongly influenced by both the per capita gross domestic product and soil organic carbon (SOC) content. The former is an indicator of anthropogenic emissions while soil SOC content is associated with the accumulative capacities of the soils. The sequestration mechanism is an important process controlling fates of PAHs in agricultural soil.",

        "abstract": "Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was heavily used in the past in many regions of the world. The occurrence of DDTs in island populations may be elevated if the island is adjacent to major DDT consumption estuaries, such as the Yangtze River Delta. In this study, colostrum samples were collected from maternal-neonate pairs (n = 106) from the Shengsi Island, located directly downstream from the Yangtze River outlet. DDT isomers and enantiomer compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and GC/MS-MS. The average levels of p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT and total DDTs were 1.32, 0.03, 0.09, 0.08, 0.48, and 1.93  μg g(-1) lipid weight, respectively. Maternal age and pregnancy body mass index (BMI) were positively associated with levels of DDTs (p < 0.05). High (DDE+DDD)/DDT and p,p'-DDE/p,p'-DDT ratios suggested that current DDT residues originated primarily from historical use of DDT products, but new sources may also contribute partially to some high o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT ratios. Enantiomeric enrichment was found for the (-)-enantiomer of o,p'-DDD and the (+)-enantiomer of o,p'-DDT, suggesting stereoselective attenuation. Based on breast milk consumption, the average daily intake of DDTs by neonates was 8.33 ± 7.34 μg kg(-1)bw per day, which exceeded the WHO's tolerable daily intake guideline of 0.01 mg kg(-1) bw per day by 25%, implying some neonates in the Yangtze River region are potentially at high risk from exposure to DDTs.",

        "abstract": "Enantioselectivity in separation and toxicology of chiral xenobiotics have become one of the frontier topics interfacing chemistry and toxicology. In this study, enantiomers of insecticide acetofenate (AF) were separated on selected chiral columns by HPLC, and enantioselectivity in developmental toxicity was evaluated using the zebrafish embryo-larval assays. The AF enantiomers were baseline separated on Chiralcel OD, Chiralpak AD, and Sumichiral OA-2500I columns under optimized conditions. Pure enantiomers were obtained on Chiralcel OD. Optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) and circular dichroism (CD) detectors were used to determine the elution order and CD spectra of the enantiomers. The absolute configuration of enantiomers was identified as S-(+)-AF and R-(-)-AF by the octant rule from force-field calculations and CD spectra. The individual enantiomers were used in 4-day zebrafish embryo-larval bioassays, and a series of developmental end points were measured and compared. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to investigate the expressions of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in zebrafish embryo exposed to varying enantiomers. While the enantiomers showed no difference in acute toxicity, significant enantioselectivity was observed in developmental toxicities such as yolk sac edema and pericardial edema. The data of qRT-PCR showed that there was about 3.2-fold induction in the mRNA levels of ERalpha between fish exposed to (+)-AF and (-)-AF. The results suggest that enantioselectivity may occur at the developmental level even in the absence of selective acute toxicity and should be considered when evaluating ecotoxicological effects of chiral contaminants.",

        "abstract": "Permethrin (PM), one of the most heavily used synthetic pyrethroids, has the potential to interfere with thyroid hormones in mammals, however, the effect is poorly recognized in aquatic organisms. Herein, embryonic zebrafish were exposed to PM (0, 1, 3 and 10μg/L) until 72h post-fertilization. We demonstrated that PM readily accumulated in larvae with a preference for cis-PM, inhibited development and increased thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels accompanying increase in the transcription of most target genes, i.e., thyroid-stimulating hormone β, deiodinases, thyroid receptors, involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Further Western blot analysis indicated that transthyretin (TTR) protein was significantly increased. Molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that PM fits into three hydrophobic binding pocket of TTR, one of the molecular targets of thyroid hormone disrupting chemicals (THDCs), and forms strong van der Waals interactions with six resides of TTR, including Leu8, Leu 101, Leu125, Thr214, Leu218 and Val229, thus altering TTR activity. Both in vivo and in silico studies clearly disclosed that PM potentially disrupts the thyroid endocrine system in fish. This study provides a rapid and cost-effective approach for identifying THDCs and the underlying mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Growing concern over possible adverse effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has driven the development of associated screening methods. The use of the vitellogenin (VTG) induction response in cultured teleost hepatocytes has been suggested as an in vitro screening assay for EDCs. However, current data do not sufficiently support this assay in the routine screening of chemicals. This study established and validated the use of primary cultured hepatocytes from zebrafish to screen chemicals for anti-estrogenic activities. Here we measured the transcript levels of selected hepatic estrogen-response genes, including vtg1, vtg2 and eralpha. Two model anti-estrogens, letrozole (LET), an aromatase inhibitor, and tamoxifen (TAM), a competitive estrogen receptor, were selected as representative chemicals. Additionally, comparisons between in vitro and in vivo assays were performed. As expected, there were concentration-dependent decreases for all three genes in the liver of female zebrafish exposed to LET in vivo for 72h. Similar responses were observed in males. As for in vitro testing, no discernable alterations in the gene transcripts were found in hepatocytes from males or females. In the case of TAM, exposure for 72h caused transcriptional reduction of hepatic estrogen-response genes in females in vivo and in vitro. In males, low concentrations of TAM resulted in increased expression of genes, while the expression decreased slightly at higher concentrations. Since these observations were in agreement with the pharmaceutical properties of two tested chemicals, the primary hepatocyte culture could be a promising tool for screening suspected EDCs.",

Dichlorprop methyl (DCPPM) is a chiral herbicide consisting of a pair of enantiomers. In this study, the enantiomeric separation of DCPPM was investigated by gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using chiral stationary phases (CSPs), and its enantiomeric degradation was characterized using a DCPPM-degrading bacterial strain isolated from an activated sludge from a textile-printing wastewater treatment plant. Baseline separation by both GC and HPLC was achieved. Incubation with DCPPM-degrading bacteria in different pH solutions showed that the R enantiomer was preferentially degraded over the S enantiomer of DCPPM. The degradation rate constant decreased with increasing pH in the order of k(pH5) approximately k(pH7) >k(pH9). In comparison, the enantioselectivity as indicated by EF followed the order of pH 7 > pH 9-pH 5.",

By carrying out a DWBA analysis for the experimental angular distribution of 82Ge(d, p)83Ge reaction we obtain the single particle spectroscopic factors, S2,5/2 and S0,1/2 for the ground and first excited states of 83Ge=82Gen, respectively. And then these spectroscopic factors are used to calculate the direct capture cross sections for the 82Ge(n, γ)83Ge reaction at energies of astrophysical interest. The optical potential for neutron scattering on unstable nucleus 82Ge is not known experimentally. We employed a real folding potential which was calculated by using the proper 82Ge density distribution and an effective nucleon-nucleon force DDM3Y. The neutron capture reactions on neutron-rich closed-shell nuclei are expected to be dominated by the direct capture to bound states. We will show that the direct capture rates on these nuclei are sensitive to the structure of the low-lying states.",

Because studies on the enantioselective behavior of phyto-biochemical processes and the environmental fate of metolachlor have become significant, a practical method for analyzing and separating metolachlor stereoisomers must be developed. In the present study, the enantiomeric separation of metolachlor was achieved using OD-H, AS-H, OJ-H and AY-H chiral columns. The effects of different organic modifiers in an n-hexane-based mobile phase were investigated, and various temperatures and flow rates, which may influence metolachlor separation, were also explored. The optimal resolution was obtained using an AY-H column with n-hexane/EtOH (96/4) as the mobile phase at a rate and temperature of 0.6mLmin(-1) and 25°C, respectively. The absolute configuration of the four stereoisomers was identified as αSS, αRS, αSR, αRR using computed and experimentally measured ECD and VCD spectra. Thermal interconversion and solvent stability experiments were also performed. Pure metolachlor stereoisomers in different organic solvents and water at 4°C or 30°C were stable. These results were used to establish a sound method for analyzing, preparing, characterizing, and preserving individual metolachlor stereoisomers in most natural environments. ",

From this, an indirect sensitive method for determining ascorbic acid was developed. The fluorescence intensity of the system was measured in a 1 cm quartz cell with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 303 and 340 nm, respectively. The results showed that the fluorescence intensity of the system presented a linear relationship with the concentration of ascorbic acid in the range of 1.0 x 10(-7)-8.0 x 10(-6) mol x L(-1), the correlation coefficient r was 0.9997, and the detection limit (S/N = 3) was 1.6 x 10(-8) mol x L(-1). The presented method was used to determine ascorbic acid sample and vitamin C tablet, and the results were satisfactory.",

        "abstract": "The fluorescence intensity of the enoxacin (ENX)-Tb(3+) complex enhanced by DNA was studied. On the basis of this study, an environmentally friendly fluorescence probe of enoxacin-Tb(3+) for the determination of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA was developed. Under the optimal conditions, the enhanced fluorescence intensity was in proportion to the concentration of DNA in the range of 2.0x10(-8) to 2.0x10(-6)g mL(-1) for hsDNA, 1.0x10(-8) to 1.0x10(-6)g mL(-1) for ctDNA and 5.0x10(-9) to 1.0x10(-6)g mL(-1) for thermally denatured ctDNA. The detection limits (S/N=3) were 5.0, 9.0 and 3.0ng mL(-1), respectively. The interaction modes between ENX-Tb(3+) and DNA and the mechanism of the fluorescence enhancement were also discussed in details. The experimental results from UV absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra and the competing combination tests between the ENX-Tb(3+) complex and EB probe indicated that the possible interaction modes between enoxacin-Tb(3+) complex and DNA had at least two different binding modes: the electrostatic binding and the intercalation binding. Additionally, this fluorescence probe was used to study the interaction between heavy metals and DNA.",

The range of I-TEQ values for the PCDD/Fs in the soil samples representing the pollution investigation in the study area was 2.29-9.45 ng/kg (dry weight), which means that the level of PCDD/Fs pollution was higher than that of the background (0.537 ng/kg). The I-TEQ values of PCDD/Fs for fly the ash sample and the residue sample were 3 454 and 32.2 I-TEQ ng/kg individually. The principal component analysis shows that the rural solid waste incinerator is not only one source of PCDD/Fs in soil.",

After 56-day incubation, the residual concentrations of pyrethroids in unsterilized soil were much lower than those in sterilized soil, indicating that microbial degradation was dominant for the elimination of pyrethroids. Meanwhile, the stable carbon isotope ratios of the six pyrethroids were determined during the degradation. Significant stable carbon isotope fractionation was observed during the microbial degradation of fenpropathrin, α-cypermethrin and deltamethrinhe. The enrichment factor ε was determined as -1.88‰, -1.82‰ and -2.00‰, respectively. A new approach was then developed to estimate the bioavailability of the three pyrethroids by determining stable carbon isotope ratios. The approach established in the study provides an alternative method to dynamically and quantitatively estimate bioavailability of compounds in soil based on CSIA.",

        "abstract": "A key issue in assessment on tunnel face stability is a reliable evaluation of required support pressure on the tunnel face and its variations during tunnel excavation. In this paper, a Bayesian framework involving Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is implemented to estimate the uncertainties of limit support pressure. The probabilistic analysis for the three-dimensional face stability of tunnel below river is presented. The friction angle and cohesion are considered as random variables. The uncertainties of friction angle and cohesion and their effects on tunnel face stability prediction are evaluated using the Bayesian method. The three-dimensional model of tunnel face stability below river is based on the limit equilibrium theory and is adopted for the probabilistic analysis. The results show that the posterior uncertainty bounds of friction angle and cohesion are much narrower than the prior ones, implying that the reduction of uncertainty in cohesion and friction significantly reduces the uncertainty of limit support pressure. The uncertainty encompassed in strength parameters are greatly reduced by the MCMC simulation. By conducting uncertainty analysis, MCMC simulation exhibits powerful capability for improving the reliability and accuracy of computational time and calculations.",

        "title": "Time-dependent degradation and toxicity of diclofop-methyl in algal suspensions",
        "abstract": "Background, aim, and scope  As emerging contaminants, transformation products of the pollutants via various environmental processes are rather unknown,\n and some may predominately contribute to the environmental risks of the parent compounds. Hence, studies on transformation\n products complement the assessment of the environmental safety of the parent compounds. In this study, degradation experiments\n and toxicity tests using diclofop-methyl (DM), a widely used herbicide, and selected major transformation products were carried\n out in algal cultures to assess the time course of DM toxicity and its relevance in the formation of new breakdown products.\n \n \n \n Methods  The alga Chlorella vulgaris was maintained in the algal growth medium HB IV. The inhibition of algal growth was determined by measuring optical density\n at 680 nm (OD680). Initially, DM and two selected breakdown products were added to the algal cultures, and following degradation experiments\n analyses were carried out by high performance liquid chromatography. In addition, the possible relationship between DM degradation\n and toxicity was assessed, based on physico-chemical properties of the compounds and their toxicity.\n \n \n \n Results  DM was rapidly absorbed onto the surface of the algal cells where it was hydrolyzed to diclofop (DC). Further degradation\n to 4-(2, 4-dichlorophenoxy) phenol (DP) occurred in the cells. However, only a minor amount of DC was degraded to DP under\n the same conditions when DC was initially added to the algal culture. When C. vulgaris was exposed to these compounds for 96 h, the determined EC50 showed that DC was about ten times less toxic than DM (EC50 = 0.42 mg/L) and that DP (EC50 = 0.20 mg/L) was the most toxic.\n \n \n \n Discussion  Due to strong hydrophobicity and rare dissociation, DM has tendency toward absorption as compared to DC. The higher average\n degradation rates of DC initially treated by DM revealed the damage of the cell membranes caused by the DM and, thus, enhanced\n movement of DC into the cells. Following occurrence of phenolic breakdown products, DP suggested that DC should be intracellularly\n degraded to DP, which had a more potent mode of action and a higher acute toxicity. Moreover, the results for EC50 at various intervals were in accordance with degradation processes of the initial compounds, in which rapid formation of\n DP was attributed to an increasing toxicity of DM.\n \n \n \n Conclusions  The toxicity of DM in algal suspensions increased with time due to its degradation to DP, which contributed significantly\n to the determined toxicity. These results indicate that the toxicity of the pesticide probably depends significantly on degradation.\n It is thus important to consider the time-dependent environmental processes when evaluating the toxicological effects of pesticides\n for proper risk assessment.\n \n \n \n Recommendations and perspectives  Increasing transformation products of these contaminants are identified in the environment, although they seem to be unknown\n in terms of the lacking studies on environmental behavior and ecotoxicity concerning them. Certain breakdown products probably\n greatly contribute to the apparent toxicity of the parent compounds, which is ascribed to the parent compounds in general\n studies ignoring the dependence of their toxicity on various transformation pathways. These studies that identify new intermediates\n and assess their toxicity via the environmental processes will be helpful to distinguish the nature of toxicity of the parent\n contaminants.",

        "abstract": "The manufacture and use of single- or enriched-enantiomer pesticides are green-chemistry developments advocated in the 21st century, but predictive work for chiral switch of newly produced chiral active ingredients is limited. In the present study, the stereoselective separation, target activity, and nontarget toxicity of O,S-dimethyl-N-(2,2,2-trichloro-1-methoxyethyl)phosphoramidothioate (MCP), a new organophosphorus compound, were investigated. Because being highly active and safe is a prerequisite for marketing single-isomer products, the above studies were used to offer some implications for the chiral switch of racemic MCP. The results showed that all four stereoisomers of MCP were successfully separated with a Chiralpak AD column on HPLC. The resolved isomers and the pairs of enantiomers were further distinguished using a circular dichroism detector, designating the first and third eluted peaks as one pair of enantiomers and the second and fourth peaks as the other pair. Then, the insecticidal activities and acute and delayed toxicities of the resolved isomers of MCP were evaluated by their acute lethal efficacy against Daphina magna , their inhibitory potentials to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and axon-like outgrowth of the SH-SY5Y cells, respectively. The inhibition potencies of the isomers against AChE in SH-SY5Y cells were low and slightly stereoselective. On the other hand, a significant difference was observed among the isomers in their activities and delayed neurotoxicities. The 48 h acute toxicities of isomers to D. magna followed the order peak 1 approximately pair 1 (i.e., equimolar mixture of peaks 1 and 3) > peak 4 approximately racemate > pair 2 (i.e., equimolar mixture of peaks 2 and 4) > peak 2 > peak 3, with 1.0-6.3-fold differences among them. In comparison, the inhibitory potentials of the isomers toward axon growth of SH-SY5Y cells decreased in the order peak 2 > pair 2 > peak 4 > racemate > peak 3 > pair 1 approximately peak 1, with at least a 60-fold difference between the strongest and weakest inhibitors. Those results imply that peak 1 has the optimal target selectivity and ecological profile among the four stereoisomers. It was calculated that two-thirds of the usual pesticide usage can be saved concomitantly with a substantial decrease in neuropathic risk if MCP is present only as peak 1 rather than the racemate. When considering the absence of the economically feasible synthetic methods and techniques to produce optically pure isomers of organophosphorus pesticides, pair 1 of MCP shows considerable worth for future applications on the basis of its biological predominance and cost effectiveness.",

But 40% - 50% of DLBCL patients cannot be cured by this regimen. Some clinical trials showed that bevacizumab might be useful in the treatment of DLBCL. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab combined with the R-CHOP (A-R-CHOP) regimen in Chinese patients with previously untreated DLBCL.Patients with previously untreated DLBCL received A-R-CHOP regimen therapy. All patients with complete response (CR)/ unconfirmed complete response(CRu) after 8 cycles of A-R-CHOP received the bevacizumab maintenance therapy once every 3 weeks. The remained bulky disease was treated with radiotherapy.Seven Chinese patients were treated. All of them had bulky diseases. One patient had progressive disease after 4 cycles of A-R-CHOP therapy. The rest six patients completed 8 cycles of A-R-CHOP treatment. All of these six patients reached CR/CRu (5 CR, 1 CRu). Bevacizumab maintenance therapy was given to 4 CR patients. All 7 patients experienced Grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events; additionally, one had Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity and one had Grade 1 epistaxis. During bevacizumab maintenance therapy, one patient had Grade 1 gingival bleeding, another experienced Grade 1 proteinuria and then Grade 3 congestive heart failure 4 months after completion of maintenance therapy. At the end of July 2013, the patient who had progressive disease after 4 cycles of A-R-CHOP died of progressive disease, the other six remained CR response.The A-R-CHOP regimen is effective for untreated DLBCL, but may cause bevacizumab-specific toxicities, which should be monitored.",

On one hand, plants can secrete and synthesize some chiral compounds such as glucosides, enzymes, terpenoids, organic acids and phytohormones that play important roles in plant physiological and biochemical processes, and on the other hand, artificial synthetic chiral compounds, especially pesticides, had enantioselective interactions with plants. The pesticides can enantioselectively inhibit the growth of plants, or can be enantioselectively absorbed and metabolized by plants. Therefore, in the exploitation, production and application of chiral compounds, it's needed to consider the enantioselective interaction between plants and chiral compounds. In the meanwhile, choosing appropriate plants to ameliorate the environment polluted by chiral compounds is of practical significance. In this review, the enantioselective interaction between plants and chiral compounds was summarized, and the amelioration of chiral compounds-polluted environment by plants was prospected.",

Among them, 97.6% cases (41/42) belonged to Ann Arbor stage III/IV, 73.8% (31/42) cases presented with B symptoms, 85.7% (36/42)cases had painless lymphadenopathy, 52.4% (22/42)cases extranodal involvement, 64.3% (27/42) cases elevated lactate dehydrogenase and 45.2% (19/42) cases elevated β2-microglobulin at diagnosis. And 40.5% (17/42) cases had 3 points of international prognostic index (IPI) score with the highest proportion.First-line chemotherapy was predominantly CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisolone) or CHOP-like-based and complete response was achieved in 44.7% (17/38) of them. The median follow-up time was 40 (2-106) months The 1, 2, 5-year survival rates were 78%, 57% and 39% respectively.Statistical analysis showed that IPI was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.009).Other factors included gender (P = 0.311), age (P = 0.263), with or without B symptoms (P = 0.102), Ki-67 index (P = 0.146) as well as the choice of first-line chemotherapy (P = 0.292) each had a tendency of affecting; the survival rate, but failed to reach statistical significance.Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a major type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

        "abstract": "The introduction of rituximab has improved the overall prognosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the impact of rituximab on central nervous system (CNS) involvement in DLBCL remains a matter of debate. Patients with DLBCL and no CNS involvement at initial diagnosis were eligible for this analysis. Patients must have received treatment either with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) or CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP). We analyzed the incidence, clinical features and outcomes of CNS involvement that developed during or after completion of therapy. A cohort of 599 patients was eligible for this analysis. With a median follow-up of 26 and 21 months, respectively, 19 of 294 (6.5 %) in the CHOP group and 13 of 305 (4.3 %) in the R-CHOP group developed CNS involvement. Rituximab did not significantly reduce the risk of CNS involvement either in the univariate (P = 0.354) or in the multivariate analysis (RR 0.632, 95 % CI 0.301–1.327, P = 0.225). No patient developed CNS disease after 19 months in the R-CHOP group whereas four patients (21.1 %) in the CHOP group developed CNS disease 2 years after initial diagnosis (range 34–83 months). Systemic disease prior to or coincident with CNS occurrence was more common in the CHOP group than in the R-CHOP group (73.7 versus 38.5 %, P = 0.046). Isolated CNS events were more common in the R-CHOP group than those in the CHOP group (53.8 versus 10.5 %, P = 0.015). This study indicates that isolated CNS events are more common in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP than those treated with CHOP alone. Our data also suggest that the time and pattern of CNS events and systemic disease status differ with the addition of rituximab. Better methods for earlier detection and prophylaxis of CNS involvement are needed in the rituximab era.",

        "abstract": "Thioxanthones (TXs) are photoinitiators widely used in UV curable resins and food packaging, and their residues have been frequently detected in human bodies. Our current understanding of the susceptibility of residual thioxanes to metabolism and their effects on human health is very limited. The in vitro metabolism of TXs and its toxic effects on cytochrome P450 (CYP) (the key xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes) were examined in this study. 2-Chlorothioxanthone (2-Cl-TX) significantly inhibited the enzymatic activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 with IC50 of 8.36 and 0.86 μM, respectively. The exposure to 2-Cl-TX at 2.5 μM up-regulated the mRNA expression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells to 3.03-fold and 2.02-fold, respectively. 2-Cl-TX at 2.5 μM caused 2.19-fold and 1.98-fold overexpression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, respectively. In vitro studies revealed that 2-Cl-TX was biotransformed into two metabolites through the sulfoxidation of the sulfur atoms, or via the hydroxylation of aromatic carbon. Results from this study, including the metabolic susceptibility of residual 2-Cl-TX, the proposed metabolites and the significant toxic effect on the activities, mRNA and protein expression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, are vital to the human health and safety risk assessment from this ubiquitous xenobiotic.",

        "abstract": "The presence of trace levels of pharmaceuticals is an emerging issue impacting the aquatic ecosystem. Naproxen (NPX) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been frequently detected in aquatic environments worldwide. Recently, concerns regarding endocrine disruption by NSAIDs have increased; however, their effects on the thyroid system have yet to be understood. In this study, zebrafish were utilized to evaluate the thyroid-disrupting effects of NPX. After a 60-day exposure to various concentrations of NPX (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μg/L), the body length and weight of the zebrafish were significantly decreased. The decrease of cytochrome P450 gene expression and enzyme activity might inhibit the metabolism of NPX, which might result in the significant bioconcentration in zebrafish. Thyroid hormone (TH) analysis showed that both triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels were substantially decreased. Gene transcription expressions along the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were also markedly affected. Significant downregulation of dio1, dio2, nis, nkx2.1, pax8, tg, tpo, trβ and ttr levels, along with the stimulation of the tshβ gene, were also observed in exposed fish compared to controls. Western blot analysis indicated that expression of the TTR protein was significantly decreased, which coincides with the results of the gene expression analysis. Collectively, our observations show that NPX increases the risk of bioconcentration and thyroid disruption in zebrafish. Given the continued increasing consumption and emission of pharmaceuticals, thyroid disruption should be considered when assessing the aquatic risk of long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals.",

The microstructure and some electrochemical properties were studied. Oxygen has important effects on the carbon contents of the Pt/C films. Small amount oxygen addition (3 ml/min) to the source gases decreases significantly the carbon contents of the films. The Pt/C film with higher carbon content has wider and lower XRD pattern of platinum, which has the characteristic of diffraction pattern of amorpha. The EMF values and output current of the oxygen concentration cell using Pt/C films as the electrodes are greater than those for other conventional platinum electrodes at 500℃.",

This study was conducted to measure the levels of selected trace elements in Chinese fish consumers by assessing their essentiality and toxicity via colostrum intake in newborns, and evaluated the effects of these trace elements on birth outcomes. Trace elements in umbilical cord serum and colostrum of the studied population were relatively high compared with other populations. The geometric means (GM) of estimated daily intake (EDI, mgday(-1)) of the trace elements were in the safe ranges for infant Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When using total dietary intake (TDI, mgkg(-1)bwday(-1)), zinc (Zn) (0.880mgkg(-1)bwday(-1)) and selenium (Se) (6.39×10(-3)mgkg(-1)bwday(-1)) were above the Reference Doses (RfD), set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Multivariable linear regression analyses showed that Se was negatively correlated with birth outcomes. Our findings suggested that overloading of trace elements due to environmental contamination may contribute to negative birth outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The effect of beta-cyclodextrins (beta-CDs) on the enzymatical hydrolysis of chiral dichlorprop methyl ester (DCPPM) was studied. Four kinds of beta-cyclodextrins (beta-cyclodextrin, Partly methylated-CD (PM-beta-CD), hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) and carboxymethyl-cyclodextrin (CM-beta-CD)) were used. Compared with 100% DCPPM in the absence of betacyclodextrins, the activity of lipase decreased with the increase of Pbetacyclodextrin and PM-Pbetacyclodextrin. However, CM-beta-clodextrin stimulated the lipase activity. The inhibition effect of Pbeta cyclodextrin and PM-5betacyclodextrin on the hydrolysis of DCPPM is affected by many factors other than degree of the methylation blocking the active site of lipase. UV-Vis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy studies of the complexation of aqueous DCPPM with beta-CDs provide fresh insight into the molecular structure of the complex and explain the effects of beta-CDs on enzymatical hydrolysis of chiral DCPPM. Data showed that inclusion complexes had formed by complexation of the CM-beta-CD with DCPPM and the solubility of DCPPM was increased in water, which lead to the increased lipase activity.",

This reaction was investigated for properties of resonant states of 18Ne for determining the 14O(α,p)17F reaction rate, which is one of the most important reactions for understanding the breakout mechanism from the Hot CNO cycle to the rp-process. Alpha-induced elastic scattering on 14O was performed using the lowenergy radioactive ion (RI) beam separator at the Center for Nuclear Study (CNS) in the RIKEN Accelerator Research Facility. The energy range Ex = 7.2-13.1 MeV of 18Ne was scanned with the thick target method. Recoiled alpha particles were measured with Si dE-E telescopes. Spins and widths of three resonances at Ex = 8.6, 9.22, and 10.06 MeV were calculated using the R-matrix analysis, and a new state of 18Ne at Ex = 12.0 MeV was found in this experiment.",

        "abstract": "A kinetic model for the electrochemical dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) will be animportant contribution to the design and optimization of a continuous reactor. Initially, the electro-catalytic hydrodechlorination of 2-chlorobiphenyl (2-ClBP) to biphenyl at a palladium-modified nickelfoam (Pd/Ni) cathode in a batch reactor was used as a model reaction for a quantitative study of theinfluences of the operating parameters, including temperature, the initial concentrations of PCBs, cur-rent density and the amount of Pd loading, on the apparent reaction rate. The dechlorination was foundto follow pseudo first-order kinetics with respect to the 2-ClBP concentration. It was also found that asimple global power law rate equation, with Arrhenius dependency, can be used to describe the correla-tion between the pseudo first-order reaction rate constants and the reaction conditions. Subsequently,a mathematical model for predicting the performance of reductive dechlorination of 2-ClBP on Pd/Nielectrodes in a continuous stirred tank reactor was constructed, based on the batch-reaction kinetics.The suitability of the model was validated by performing experiments in and out of the range of reactionconditions applied in the batch reactor. The results show that the calculated values are a good fit to theexperimental data. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

METHODS: The model of electrically stimulated carotid artery thrombosis in Sprague Dawley rats was used; the effects of copper-aspirin complex on rat platelet-neutrophil adhesion and platelet aggregation stimulated by activated neutrophils were observed by rosette assay and Born's method, respectively. RESULTS: Intragastric copper-aspirin complex (5, 7, and 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently prolonged the occlusion time; it signifi- cantly decreased the rosette number formed between thrombin-activated platelets and neutrophils; the 50 % of inhibitory concentration (IC50) was (54.6±4.3) µmol/L. Copper-aspirin complex markedly inhibited rat platelet aggregation induced by either cell free supernatant of activated neutrophils or by activated neutrophil suspension. The values of IC50 were (224.5±16.2) µmol/L and (820.5±21.4) µmol/L, whereas aspirin had no influence. CONCLUSION: Copper-aspirin complex inhibited platelet-neutrophil interactions through a different property from aspirin and resulted in a more potent antithrombotic activity.",

        "abstract": "This work investigated the degradation and detoxification of acetochlor in a soil amended with an organic fertilizer or sodium thiosulfate (STS). Over an incubation period of 28 d, the residual acetochlor was measured, soil dehydrogenase activity was determined, and major degradates were identified. Results show that high-concentration acetochlor was persistent in the soil, as indicated by the depression in soil dehydrogenase activity. When the soil was amended with the organic fertilizer, the soil dehydrogenase activity was stimulated by supplemented nutrients, which resulted in a higher degradation of acetochlor. While STS did not significantly stimulate the soil dehydrogenase activity, acetochlor degraded more rapidly in STS-amended soil than in organic-amended soil. The Wright-Hobbie plots show that the influence of initial acetochlor concentration on degradation was dependent on the amendments. While the organic amendment resulted in the same degradate of acetochlor ethanesulfonic acid as in unamended soil, the STS amendment produced dechlorinated acetochlor thiosulfonic acid. The degradation of acetochlor in organic- and STS-amended soils thus occurred via different mechanisms. Further tests show that both degradates were less toxic to green algae than acetochlor. Both organic and STS amendments thus effectively degrade and detoxify acetochlor in soils.",

        "abstract": "Triazole fungicides, one category of broad-spectrum fungicides, are widely applied in agriculture and medicine. The extensive use leads to many residues and casts potential detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. After exposure of the human body, triazole fungicides may penetrate into the bloodstream and interact with plasma proteins. Whether they could have an impact on the structure and function of proteins is still poorly understood. By using multispectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling, the interaction of several typical triazole fungicides with human serum albumin (HSA), the major plasma protein, was investigated. The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectra manifested that static type, due to complex formation, was the dominant mechanism for fluorescence quenching. Structurally related binding modes speculated by thermodynamic parameters agreed with the prediction of molecular modeling. For triadimefon, hydrogen bonding with Arg-218 and Arg-222 played an important role, whereas for imazalil, myclobutanil, and penconazole, the binding process was mainly contributed by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Via alterations in three-dimensional fluorescence and circular dichroism spectral properties, it was concluded that triazoles could induce slight conformational and some microenvironmental changes of HSA. It is anticipated that these data can provide some information for possible toxicity risk of triazole fungicides to human health and be helpful in reinforcing the supervision of food safety.",

        "abstract": "Background: Fluorine is a key element for nucleosynthetic studies since it is extremely sensitive to the physical conditions within stars. The astrophysical site to produce fluorine is suggested to be asymptotic giant branch stars. In these stars the N15(n,��)N16 reaction could affect the abundance of fluorine by competing with N15(��,��)F19. Purpose: The N15(n,��)N16 reaction rate depends directly on the neutron spectroscopic factors of the low-lying states in N16. Shell model calculations and two previous measurements of the (d,p) reaction yielded the spectroscopic factors with a discrepancy by a factor of ��2. The present work aims to explore these neutron spectroscopic factors through an independent transfer reaction and to determine the stellar rate of the N15(n,��)N16 reaction. Methods: The angular distributions of the N15(Li7,Li6)N16 reaction populating the ground state and the first three excited states in N16 are measured using a Q3D magnetic spectrograph and are used to derive the spectroscopic factors of these states based on distorted wave Born approximation analysis. Results: The spectroscopic factors of these four states are extracted to be 0.96 �� 0.09, 0.69 �� 0.09, 0.84 �� 0.08, and 0.65 �� 0.08, respectively. Based on the new spectroscopic factors we derive the N15(n,��)N16 reaction rate. Conclusions: The accuracy and precision of the spectroscopic factors are enhanced due to the first application of high-precision magnetic spectrograph for resolving the closely spaced N16 levels which cannot be achieved in most recent measurements. The present result demonstrates that two levels corresponding to neutron transfers to the 2s1/2 orbit in N16 are not good single-particle levels although N15 is a closed neutron-shell nucleus. This finding is contrary to the shell model expectation. The present work also provides an independent examination to shed some light on the existing discrepancies in the spectroscopic factors and the N15(n,��)N16 rate. ? 2014 American Physical Society.",

This review describes reports of the enantiomeric separation of commercial organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) and the applications of these methods to research on the enantioselectivity of the toxicity and environmental fate of these compounds. Chiral OPs can be analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE). These different separation techniques for OP enantiomers are briefly discussed, and their applications are presented.",

The anticancer activity and toxicity were evaluated by comparing its interaction with DNA, cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines, antitumor efficiency in human gastric carcinoma NCI-N87 xenografts in nude mice, and preliminary side-effects in rats to those of its 4R,5R-optical isomer which is under preclinical development. Both isomers induce condensation of DNA to the same extent and have similar cytotoxicity, but show different antitumor activity and toxicity, probably owing to the difference in respective pharmacokinetic profiles. 4S,5S-Isomer seems to exhibit superior antitumor activity and less toxicity than 4R,5R-optical isomer as well as the parent heptaplatin. These results imply that 4S,5S-configuration as a new drug candidate may be better than 4R,5R-counterpart.",

We evaluated the effects of BFOV on lipolysis in isolated rat adipocytes and lipid metabolism in fat-fed/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, an animal model of type 2 diabetes.Antilipolytic action of BFOV was investigated by observing free fatty acids (FFA) release in isolated rat adipocytes treated with epinephrine and forskolin. Diabetic rats were induced by high-fat feeding plus STZ injection (25 mg/kg, i.p.). The rats were randomly divided into non-diabetic, diabetic, diabetic-BFOV (0.02, 0.06 and 0.2 mmol/kg) and diabetic-vanadyl sulfate group. All substances were given intragastrically to rats for 4 weeks. The concentrations of blood glucose, serum lipid and leptin, as well as body weight and food intake were determined.FFA release from adipocytes treated with epinephrine was markedly inhibited by BFOV and vanadyl sulfate, with the IC(50) values of 0.30+/-0.20 and 0.46+/-0.26 mmol/l, respectively, but not by insulin. Whereas, the inhibition of vanadyl compounds on FFA release triggered by forskolin in adipocytes were not observed. BFOV dose-dependently reduced serum triglycerides and FFA concentrations when compared with untreated diabetic rats (P<0.05), while it did not influence cholesterol concentrations, similar to vanadyl sulfate. Serum leptin concentration was also decreased both in the BFOV- and vanadyl sulfate-treated diabetic group (P<0.05). Moreover, BFOV markedly reduced blood glucose concentration and food intake (P<0.05), but it did not change the body weight of diabetic rats.BFOV has an antilipolytic action in adipocytes mediated by catecholamines. This action was distinct from that of insulin and also not related to inhibiting the activity of adenylate cyclase. In vivo, BFOV could improve dyslipidemia and leptin sensitivity in fat-fed/STZ-diabetic rats.",

Residues of OCPs ranged from 0.190 to 5.17 ng g(-1) dry weight with a distinct \"band type\" pattern under the control of Yangtze River inputs and ECS circulation system. Differences in transmission media and redox conditions in situ respectively resulted in the divergent distributions of α/β-HCH and DDD/DDE. The compositional pattern analysis implied that OCPs in the inner shelf of ECS were derived from both \"weathered\" and fresh sources, whereas those in the outer shelf of ECS had undergone high metabolism. Concurrent with the land-sea migration, vertical profiles of sediment cores showed increasing trends or rebound since the 1990s, characteristic of two evident \"jumps\" of DDE+DDD/DDT and DDT/DDE ratios. Moreover, the primary distribution pattern founded for HCHs and the considerable mass inventories calculated (6.20 metric tones for OCPs) together suggested that the contaminated sediments in the studied area to be a potential source of OCPs to the global ocean.",

        "abstract": "The greatest concern over DDT exposure in China arose since the early 1990s for the rising breast cancer incidence, and the cause still remains to be elucidated. An extensive survey of DDT background in agricultural soils, covered the entire region of China, was conducted. DDT at concentrations greater than 100 ng/g (the China's Farmland Environmental Quality Evaluation Standards for Edible Agricultural Products) was found to impact 42.3 million Chinese population. Considering the geographical differences with diverse DDT contributions and different diet products and habits, the average daily dietary intake was modeled and estimated to be 0.34 μg/kg p,p'-DDE (the main bioactive constituent in DDT). Population attributable fraction derived from a case-control study from 78 women with breast cancer and 72 controls was used to assess the DDT exposure risk to breast cancer. Based on the estimated population attributable fraction with a median value of 0.6% (IQR 0.23-2.11%), the excess annual breast cancer incidence rate attributable to p,p'-DDE exposure averaged 0.06×10(-5) with significant spatial variations varying from 0.00021×10(-5) to 11.05×10(-5) in Chinese females. Exposure to DDT is a contributor to breast cancer, but the overall limited relative risk and population attributable fraction imply confounding factors for breast cancer in Chinese females. Exposure risk in a regional scale helps understand the cause and prevention of breast cancer. Our mapping and modeling method could be used to assess other environmental carcinogens and related cancer diseases.",

        "abstract": "Metolachlor (MT) is one of the most important pesticides applied to corn and other crops for controlling broadleaf and grass weeds. However, the effects of MT on the thyroid system in fish remain to be elucidated. In the present experiment, transcription of genes related to the thyroid system, including thyrotropin releasing hormone (Trh), deiodinase 2 (Dio2), thyroid hormone receptor α (Thrα), and thyroid hormone receptor β (Thrβ), were induced by MT in a sex-, developmental stage-, and tissue- specific manner when medaka were exposed to various concentrations of MT for 14 days. The transcriptional levels of the genes were only significantly altered in both juvenile and adult female medaka in response to MT exposure. And the lowest concentrations able to significantly induce transcription of the selected genes were 10 and 100 μg/L in juvenile and adult female medaka, respectively. In adult female medaka, a significant up-regulation of these genes was detected only in the brain, with little or no effect in the liver. Furthermore, MT-induced (100 μg/L) transcription of thyroid system-related genes was enhanced significantly in male juvenile medaka in the presence of estrogen (E2) (50 and 100 ng/L). Moreover, the mRNA levels of Thrα and Thrβ in males increase with the combined treatments of 100 μg/L MT and 100 ng/L E2. Dio2 increased when exposed to 100 μg/L MT and 50 or 100 ng/L E2. The information obtained in the present study suggests that MT has the potential to influence several steps of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis homeostasis and to disrupt the thyroid system in medaka.",

        "abstract": "Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was adopted to investigate the transcription of the estrogen-responsive genes in different developmental stages of zebrafish exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 17beta-estradiol for inducing vtg1 transcription were 0.25, 0.5, 0.25 and <or=0.1 microg/L for embryo, larvae, juvenile and adult male zebrafish, respectively, while the LOECs of nonylphenol for induction of vtgs transcription were 50 microg/L in embryo and 100 microg/L in larvae and adult stages. The mRNA levels of the two vtgs were low in both the embryo and larvae stages, even at the highest 17beta-estradiol or nonylphenol exposure concentrations, while the mRNA levels in liver of adult zebrafish of the two vtgs were 10(2) or even 10(4) times higher than those of the control groups at the corresponding nonylphenol or 17beta-estradiol exposure concentrations. Similarity, the ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA levels in juvenile and adult zebrafish livers were also higher. Results suggest that in the early developmental stages of zebrafish might be more sensitive (low LOECs) to the presence of EDCs such as nonylphenol, but juvenile and adult zebrafish have a more effective (high induction levels). The use of zebrafish juveniles, larvae and embryos offers an alternative stage to detect EDCs.",

        "abstract": "Algal blooms have been increasing in prevalence all over the world, destroying ecosystems and placing other organisms at risk. Chemical remediation is one of most important methods of controlling algal bloom formation. The effects of copper sulfate, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine on photosynthesis-related and microcystin-related gene transcription and physiological changes of Microcystis aeruginosa were analyzed. The results suggest that transcription of psaB, psbD1 and rbcL was inhibited by the three algaecides, which blocked the electron transport chain, significantly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and overwhelmed the antioxidant system. The increase in ROS destroyed pigment synthesis and membrane integrity, which inhibited or killed the algal cells. Furthermore, H(2)O(2) treatment down-regulated mcyD transcription, which indicated a decrease in the microcystin level in the cells. Our results demonstrate that H(2)O(2) has the greatest potential as an algaecide because it not only inhibits algae growth but may reduce microcystin synthesis.",

The recoil protons were measured by a AE-E counter telescope based on a large area double-sided silicon strip detector at laboratory angles around θo = 15°. The excitation function for 12C(p,p) elastic scattering has been obtained over a wide energy range of Ec.m.=0.31-3.45 MeV, which was explained quite well by the R-matrix calculation with known resonance parameters of the first three levels in 13N nucleus.

        "abstract": "Reduced uncertainty in the thermonuclear rate of the 33S(p, γ)34Cl reaction would help to improve our understanding of nucleosynthesis in classical nova explosions. At present, models are generally in concordance with observations that nuclei up to roughly the calcium region may be produced in these explosive phenomena; better knowledge of this rate would help with the quantitative interpretation of nova observations over the S-Ca mass region, and contribute towards the firm establishment of a nucleosynthetic endpoint. As well, models find that the ejecta of nova explosions on massive oxygen-neon white dwarfs may contain as much as 150 times the solar abundance of 33S. This characteristic isotopic signature of a nova explosion could possibly be observed through the analysis of microscopic grains formed in the environment surrounding a nova and later embedded within primitive meteorites. An improved 33S(p,γ)34Cl rate (the principal destruction mechanism for 33S in novae) would help to ensure a robust model prediction for the amount of 33S that may be produced. Finally, constraining this rate could confirm or rule out the decay of an isomeric state of 34Cl (Ex=146keV, t 1/2=32m) as a source for observable gamma-rays from novae. We have performed several complementary experiments dedicated to improving our knowledge of the 33S(p,γ)34Cl rate, using both indirect methods (measurement of the 34S(3He,t)34Cl and 33S(3He,d)34Cl reactions with the Munich Q3D spectrograph) and direct methods (in normal kinematics at CENPA, University of Washington, and in inverse kinematics with the DRAGON recoil mass separator at TRIUMF). Our results will be used with nova models to facilitate comparisons of model predictions with present and future nova observables. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

        "title": "Binding of phenthoate to bovine serum albumin and reduced inhibition on acetylcholinesterase",
        "abstract": "Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are of environmental significance due to their high toxicity to animals. Binding to plasma proteins may effective influence the toxicological properties of xenobiotics. In an attempt to evaluate the affinity of phenthoate (PTA) to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and inhibitory ability of bound PTA to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), we investigated the interactions between phenthoate (PTA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) using tryptophan fluorescence quenching and subsequent inhibition on AChE activity by PTA. The results showed that PTA caused the fluorescence quenching of BSA because of the formation of a PTA–BSA complex. Quenching constants ( K sv ), determined using the Sterns–Volmer equation to provide a measure of the binding affinity between PTA and BSA at 303, 306, 310 and 313 K were (3.4295 ± 0.0763) × 10 −4 , (3.2446 ± 0.0635) × 10 −4 , (3.0434 ± 0.0856) × 10 −4 and (2.8262 ± 0.0569) × 10 −4 M −1 , respectively. The thermodynamic parameters, Δ H and Δ S were −25.04 kJ mol −1 and 168.94 J mol −1 K −1 , respectively, which indicated that the electrostatic interactions played a major role in PTA–BSA association. The presence of BSA consistently reduced the inhibitory ability of PTA on AChE, with the relative activity being increased from 46.98 to 61.71% for the concentration range of BSA between 0 and 4.0 g L −1 . Keywords Organophosphorus pesticide Bioavailability Fluorescence Phenthoate Bovine serum albumin 1 Introduction Albumin constitutes approximately half of the total blood protein and is the most abundant soluble protein in the body of all vertebrates and the most prominent protein in plasma. It is responsible for the colloidal osmotic pressure of plasma and the maintenance of blood volume. It also supplies most of the acid/base buffering action of plasma proteins in extravascular fluids. Albumin binds and transports metabolites and drugs and is a principal binding protein in blood plasma for a large number of xenobiotics [1] . Interactions of plasma protein and pesticides have a toxicological importance, because it controls the degree and time of pesticidal actions in the body [2] . Furthermore, pesticides bound to albumin can serve as a new biomarker of pesticide exposure in humans [3] . The toxicokinetic behavior of pesticides can be largely dependent on the binding phenomena [4] . Therefore, the protein binding studies are of great importance, although the affinity of pesticides to plasma proteins is often lower than for target enzymes [5] . Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are one of the most important classes of insecticides used for protecting crops, livestock, and human health during the past 60 years [6–8] . It is estimated that approximately 200 different OPs are currently used commercially worldwide [9] . Almost every person is or has been exposed to OPs in their home or at work as trace dietary contaminants [10] . OPs have a high acute toxicity that results primarily from the inactivation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [11] . However, the toxic effects of individual OPs cannot be entirely attributed to the inhibition of target enzymes such as AChE. Some toxicological observations suggest that OPs have other biological actions in their cholinesterase-inhibitory properties [12] . Further studies revealed that toxic signs do not well correlate with the degree of AChE inhibition [13] . The hypothesis thus arose that a given OP reacts not only with AChE, but also with a set of proteins. Experiments with purified albumin in vitro have already demonstrated the covalent binding of albumin to some compounds such as diisopropylfluorophosphate, sarin and soman [14–16] . To our knowledge, however, the binding of albumin to PTA and the toxicity of bound PTA have not been reported yet. In this study, we investigated the interactions of PTA with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in vitro using the fluorescence quenching method described by the well-known Stern–Volmer equation [17] . Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by PTA in the present of BSA was further evaluated; the IC 50 shift induced by BSA was calculated. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals BSA (purity >98%) was purchased from BioBasic Company, China. The Tris buffer had a purity of no less than 99.5%. The other chemicals were of analytical purity. Acetylcholine iodide (ATCh-I), 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and electric eel acetylcholinesterase (EE AChE; type VI-A) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis) and used as received. Phenthoate (PTA) was purified from a technical grade (purity >98%) product of Dafeng Company, China. The BSA samples were dissolved in Tris–HCl buffer solution (0.05 mol L −1 Tris, 0.15 mol L −1 NaCl, pH 7.4 ± 0.1). 2.2 Spectroscopic measurements Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using a spectrophotometer F-2500 (Hitachi, Japan) equipped with 1.0-cm quartz cells and a thermostat bath at various temperatures (303, 306, 310 and 313 K). The 2.0-ml solution containing appropriate concentration of BSA was titrated in the Tris buffer solution (pH 7.40) by successive additions of PTA working solution (the range of PTA concentrations was from 2.0 × 10 −7 to 1.8 × 10 −6 mol L −1 ). PTA (total volume 2.0 × 10 −5 L) was added from a concentrated stock solution and its volume increment was thus negligible. Titration was performed manually using a microsyringe. The mixed solution was shaken thoroughly and equilibrated for 1 min before fluorescence was recorded. Care was taken to avoid the presence of significant air bubbles. Tryptophan was excited at 290 nm and emission spectra were recorded at 340 nm. The widths of both the excitation slit and the emission slit were set at 5 nm. Appropriate blanks (i.e., the buffer solution) were subtracted to correct the fluorescence background. A Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer was used for measuring the absorbance of albumin solution at excitation and emission wavelengths to evaluate the existing primary and secondary inner filter effects (IFEs). PTA had no emission spectrum between 300 and 450 nm. The inner filter effects were thus neglected. 2.3 AChE activities measurements The AChE activity was spectrophotometrically determined at 37°C with a Bio-Rad model 680-microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), according to Correll and Ehrich [18] . Briefly, test solutions (20 μL) at various concentrations of PTA were placed in 500-μL centrifuge tubes, followed by the addition of 180 μL of AChE solution. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Meanwhile, control samples were also prepared using 20 μL of phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) in place of test solution. DTNB solution (210 μL) and 20 μL of ATCh-I solution were added to the wells on a 96-well microtiter plate. Enzyme standard or enzyme-PTA (20 μL) was subsequently added to make the final concentrations of DTNB and ATCh-I at 0.28 and 0.5 mM, respectively. The enzymatic activities of these mixtures were determined at 405 nm from the addition of enzyme. All the tests and measurements were performed in four replicates. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Fluorescent characteristics of BSA BSA solution was titrated by PTA stock solution. Fluorescence emission spectra for BSA in the presence of increasing concentrations of PTA were shown in Fig. 1 . PTA caused a decrease in the protein tryptophan fluorescence quantum yield. A slight blue shift (7 nm at 1.8 ×10 −6 mol L −1 ) at the maximum emission wavelength was observed, suggesting that binding of PTA was associated with changes in the dielectric environment of at least one of the two indole rings in BSA [19] . The fluorescence quenching data are usually analyzed by the Stern–Volmer equation [20] : (1) F 0 = F ( 1 + K sv Q ) where F 0 and F are the relative steady-state fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher (phenthoate), respectively; K sv is the Stern–Volmer quenching constant; Q is the quencher concentration. Fluorescence quenching refers to any process that decreases the fluorescence intensity of a sample. A variety of molecular interactions can result in quenching, including molecular rearrangements, excited-state reactions, energy transfer, ground-state complex formation, and collisional quenching. A linear Stern–Volmer plot ( Fig. 1 b) can be obtained with either collisional static quenching [21] . Collisional quenching is a diffusion-controlled process that occurs when a quencher molecule is within a certain minimal distance from the fluorophore at the time of excitation. In contrast, static quenching results from the formation of a complex between fluorophore and quencher. To differentiate between these quenching mechanisms, temperature effects were investigated. Since higher temperatures result in larger diffusion coefficients, the quenching constants are expected to increase with temperature. In contrast, elevated temperature decreases the stability of complexes and thus lowers the values of the static quenching constants. Table 1 indicates that the quenching mechanism of fluorescence of BSA by PTA is most likely a static quenching procedure. Stern–Volmer quencher constants ( K sv ) were inversely correlated with temperature. According to Table 1 , the quenching data were analyzed by the following modified Stern–Volmer equation [22] : (2) F 0 Δ F = 1 f a K a 1 Q + 1 f a where Δ F is the difference in fluorescence in the absence and presence of the quencher at concentration Q , f a is the fraction of accessible fluorescence, and K a is the effective quenching constant for the accessible fluorophore. The data in Table 2 indicate that K a was dependent on temperature as described above and that the effect of temperature on binding constant between PTA and BSA was small. The F 0 /Δ F is linearly related to the reciprocal value of the quencher concentration (i.e., [ Q ] −1 ) with a slope of ( f a K a ) −1 . The value f a - 1 is the intercept. The constant K a is a quotient of the ordinate f a - 1 and the slope ( f a K a ) −1 . The results at different temperatures are shown in Table 2 . The decreasing trend of K a with increasing temperature is in keeping with K sv ’s dependence on temperature as mentioned earlier. It shows that the binding constant between PTA and BSA was moderate and the effect of temperature was small. Thus, PTA can be stored and carried by this protein in the body [23] . 3.2 Determination of the force between PTA and BSA The interaction forces between drugs and biomolecules may include hydrophobic force, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, steric contacts within antibody-binding sites, etc. To elucidate the interactions between phenthoate and BSA for static quenching, the thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the van’t Hoff plots. Both the enthalpy change (Δ H ) and entropy change (Δ S ) can be obtained from the following van’t Hoff equation [22] : (3) ln K a = - Δ H RT + Δ S R The enthalpy change (Δ H ) is calculated from the slope of the van’t Hoff equation. The free energy change (Δ G ) is then estimated from the following relationship [22] : (4) Δ G = Δ H - T Δ S From the data in Table 2 , Fig. 2 shows the values of Δ H and Δ S for the binding sites from the slopes and intercepts at the origin of the fitted lines. The negative value of free energy (Δ G ) in Table 2 demonstrates that the binding process was spontaneous. The negative enthalpy (Δ H ) and positive entropy (Δ S ) values for the interactions between PTA and BSA indicate that the electrostatic interactions played a major role in the binding reaction [22] . 3.3 Relationship between BSA concentration and AChE inhibition Inhibition of AChE by PTA in the presence of BSA at various concentrations was further evaluated. The inhibition abilities of PTA to AChE were significantly different in the presence and absence of albumin ( Fig. 3 ). In the reactive system, the relative activities of AChE increased with initial concentration of BSA, which suggests that phenthoate may be partially bound to BSA with a reduced free concentration. The presence of BSA in the system consistently reduced the inhibition of phenthoate to AChE, with the relative activity being increased from 46.98 to 61.71% for the concentration range of BSA. 3.4 The reductive effect of increasing BSA concentrations against phenthoate inhibition to AChE, as assessed by the IC 50 shift IC 50 determinations were done in the absence and presence of BSA at increasing concentrations. Enzyme activities were corrected for BSA induced enzyme activity. The calculated IC 50 values were plotted against BSA concentrations to obtain an IC 50 shift curve. The slope of the shift curve (tg α ) was used to quantify the magnitude of the protective effect (mg L −1 IC 50 increase per g L −1 BSA). The IC 50 shift [tg α (mg/g)] has no unit. The IC 50 shift induced by BSA is non-linear. At low concentrations (1.0–2.0 g L −1 ), tg α was small, indicative of a small decreasing effect of BSA. At higher concentrations (2.0–4.0 g/L), tg α was larger ( Fig. 4 ). Similar phenomena were reported in a previous study [24] . This might be explained on the basis that the number of binding sites at low concentrations were less than at higher concentrations, although the exact mechanism remains to be understood. 4 Conclusions In this paper, we investigated the nature and magnitude of the interactions of PTA with BSA by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that the Stern–Volmer quenching constant K sv is inversely correlated with temperature, which indicates that the quenching mechanism of the PTA–BSA binding reaction is probably initiated by complex formation. The free energy change Δ G being <0 at various temperatures indicates that the binding process is spontaneous. Δ H < 0 and Δ S > 0 indicate that the electrostatic force is the major factor in the interaction. Binding of OPs to albumin could serve to scavenge OPs and consequently reduce the amount of OPs reacting with AChE. As the affinity of various OPs for albumin is likely to vary, the effectiveness of albumin as an OP scavenger is likely to depend on the identity of the OP.

        "abstract": "Objective To establish the experimental model of the optimized pure titanium dome with self-tapping threads on rabbit calvarial bone surface. Methods The prefabricated pure titanium domes, with inner empty hemispherical shape, was performed by special precision machine tool, added some self-tapping threads on the root of the domes and two circular small holes on the top (diameter 0.8 mm). All the inner surface of the pure titanium domes had the same basic form and topography. Fourty-eight pure titanium domes were placed in calvarial bone surface of twelve healthy New Zealand rabbits. The animals were sacrificed at 2nd week, 4th week and 6 th week after the placement of pure titanium dome. The stability of the pure titanium domes were investigated by general observation and Micro CT scanning. Various histomorphometric observations were performed in the central of the undecalcified sections. Results The stability of the forty-eight pure titanium domes were excellent at 2nd week, 4 th week and 6th week when the rabbits were scarified. Only 2 were less fixable at the initial placing process with loose rate 4.17% in general observation. The Micro CT showed that all the pure titanium domes were fixed well on rabbit calvarial bone space. The results of the undecalcified sections showed that the bone tissue around the bottom of the pure titanium dome grew into the thread, which indicated the stability of the domes in different times. The pure titanium domes with self-tapping thread was helpful for distinction of new bone tissue growth. Conclusion The design of the pure titanium dome with self-trapping screw is less complicate than the traditional ones. The self-trapping screws do help to increase the stability of the pure titanium domes.The application of the pure domes with self-trapping screws on rabbit calvarial bone surface reduces the surgical trauma and simplify the operation steps, improve the efficiency, which was more objective and reliable to reflect implant biocompatibility and bone response. The optimized pure titanium dome with self-trapping screw is a kind of application prospect in animal experimental model for implant surface treatment.",

The $^6$Li($p, gamma$)$^7$Be reaction can provide us not only the information for destroying $^6$Li but also the information for producing $^7$Be. In the present work, the proton spectroscopic factor in $^7$Be was extracted to be 0.70 $pm$ 0.17 from the angular distribution of $^7$Be($d$, $^3$He)$^6$Li at $E_mathrm{c.m.}$ = 6.7 MeV. The value was then used to compute the direct component of the astrophysical $^6$Li($p, gamma$)$^7$Be$_mathrm{g.s.}$ S(E) factors and determine the resonance parameters from the total S(E) factors.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) are a family of chiral insecticides with a large number of stereoisomers. Fenvalerate (FV) is one of the most potent pyrethroid insecticides, controlling a wide range of insect pests in agricultural fields, public health situations and animal houses. FV contains two chiral centers. In this study, four stereoisomers of FV were absolutely separated by high-performance liquid chromatography with a commercial chiral column, CHIRALCEL OJ-H, using n-hexane containing 1,2-dichloroethane and ethanol as mobile phase. Toxicity assays of each isomer and racemate of FV were performed using Daphnia magna (D. magna), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and zebrafish embryo-larval. In the acute toxicity of D. magna, significant differences were observed: the 24h EC(50) of alphaS-2S-FV was 51 times more toxic than the alphaR-2R-FV, and the 48 h LC(50) results showed that the alphaS-2S-FV was 99 times more toxic than alphaR-2R-FV. In the toxicity assay of D. rerio, dramatic differences were also found: the LC(50) value of alphaS-2S-FV was 17, 22, 39 and 56 times more toxic than the alphaR-2R-FV at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, respectively. The assays of 4-day-old zebrafish embryo-larval showed that the exposure to FV enantioselectively induced crooked body, yolk sac edema and pericardial edema and that the alphaS-2S-FV was 3.8 times stronger than the other isomers in 96-h mortality. The results indicate that the enantiomeric differences should be taken into consideration in assessing the ecological effects of SPs.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) are among the most heavily used insecticides for residential and agricultural applications. Their residues have frequently been detected in aquatic ecosystems. Despite their high aquatic toxicity, their toxicokinetics are still unclear. In this study, the kinetics of uptake and depuration of three SPs, permethrin (PM), bifenthrin (BF) and λ-cyhalothrin (λ-CH), were determined for the first time using zebrafish eleutheroembryo assays. The diastereoisomer selectivity of PM in eleutheroembryos was further examined. The results indicated that three SPs were quickly taken up by eleutheroembryos. The bioaccumulation factors of the SPs ranged from 125.4 to 708.4. The depuration of SPs in zebrafish eleutheroembryos followed the first-order process. The elimination rate constants (k2) of SPs in eleutheroembryos ranged from 0.018 h(-1) to 0.0533 h(-1). The half-lives (t1/2) were in the range 13.0-38.5h. The diastereoisomer fraction (DF) values for PM in the eleutheroembryos estimated at different uptake and depuration times were all significantly greater than the original value (DF=0.43), indicating selective enrichment and elimination of cis-PM relative to trans-PM. These results reveal a high capacity for SP bioconcentration by zebrafish eleutheroembryos, suggesting that SPs possess a highly cumulative risk to fish.",

Therefore, a sensitive fluorescence method for the determination of DNA was developed. The optimal conditions of the method were as follows: the hexamethylenamine (HMA)-HCl buffer was adopted for adjusting the pH to 6.5 +/- 0.1, the concentrations of NFX and Tb3+ were both fixed in 1.0 x 10(-6) mol L(-1), and the excitation and emission wavelengths were selected at 290 and 545 nm, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the enhanced fluorescence intensity was in proportion to the concentration of DNA in the same range of 5.0 x 10(-9) - 1.0 x 10(-6) g mL(-1) for hsDNA and thermally denatured ctDNA. The detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.9 and 0.6 ng mL(-1), respectively. In addition, the interaction between NFX-Tb3+ and DNA was discussed in detail. The experimental results from UV absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, and the salt effect study indicated that the interaction between norfloxacin-Tb3+ complex and DNA had at least two different binding modes: the electrostatic binding and the intercalation binding. The mechanism of the fluorescence enhancement effect was also discussed.",

METHODS: Isolated rabbit aortic strips, including intact endothelium strips and endothelial cell-denuded aortic strips, were suspended in modified Krebs solution to determine effects of copper aspirinate on the contraction induced by norepinephrine (NE), KCl, and CaCl2, while CuSO4, aspirin, and vehicle were used as controls. RESULTS: Copper aspirinate possessed antagonistic effect on contraction of rabbit aortic strips induced by NE with an IC50 value of 31 nmol/L, while CuSO4 had much less antagonistic effect with an IC50 value of 0.29 μmol/L, and aspirin did not work in the same preparation. No effect of copper aspirinate were found on the contraction induced by KCl and CaCl2. Effects on endothelial cell denuded aortic strips were similar to those in the normal aortic strips. CONCLUSION: Copper aspirinate possessed different effects from aspirin and CuSO4 on vascular smooth muscles. It inhibited contraction induced by NE with an activity stronger than CuSO4 at the same Cu2+ concentration, this action might be due to blockade of the receptor-operated Ca2+ channels, and it might not be linked to the endothelium.",

        "abstract": "Breast milk, especially colostrum, is not just a source of nutrients and immune factors for the newborn, but also accumulates environmental persistent pollutants and its diverse microbes affect the early colonization of the newborn's gut. Little is known about associations between environmental pollutants and the microbial composition of human colostrum. We assessed the influence of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), a persistent organic pollutant (POP), in colostrums on the microbial composition of human colostrum samples. HCH concentrations in 89 colostrum samples collected from a population living on the easternmost island of China were measured via gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometer (GC-MS), HCH exposure risks for infants via dietary intake of breast milk were assessed, and for 29 colostrum samples the microbiota were profiled using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to assess the association with HCH exposure levels. Our study confirmed high colostrum exposure levels of total HCHs (12.19 ± 13.68 μg L) in this Chinese population. We predominantly identified Proteobacteria (67.6%) and Firmicutes (25.1%) in colostrum and microbial diversity at the genus level differed between samples with different HCH levels; e.g., Pseudomonas which contains several HCH degrading strains was found in significantly higher abundance in γ-HCH rich samples. Also, microbes that were statistically significantly associated with HCH levels were also highly correlated with each other (false discovery rate (FDR)＜0.01) and clustered in network analysis. Microbial diversity is associated with HCH levels in human colostrum and these associations might be attributable to their HCH degrading ability. These finding provide first insights into the role that environmental persistent pollutants may play in the microbial composition of human colostrum and the colonization of the infant gut.",

The results show that all the grains exhibit a sharp band near 3280 cm-1 or 3295 cm-1. Two structures have been suggested about the position of H in rutile, namely the chanel center (CC) and basal octahedron edge (BOE) models. The lattice structure and electronic band structure of Al-H and Fe-H codoped rutile TiO2 has been calculated by first-principles method. According to O-H bond vibration frequency of FTIR and O-H⋯O bond distance between O-O of computational results, we deduce that modified channel center (MCC) model is more reasonable. The calculation results indicate that the t2g state of Fe overlaps with the O 2p state, which will narrow the band gap and lead to red shift in optical absorption spectra. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society.",

        "abstract": "p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), the major isomer of persistent 1,1-Bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane metabolite, is highly associated with the risk of liver cancer. γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), which is the rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and an important scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is considered as a potential therapeutic target for many cancers. However, the association between the body burden of p,p'-DDE and γ-GCS has not been fully established. Here, we indicated that low doses of p,p'-DDE exposure promoted the proliferation and decreased γ-GCS activity of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, p,p'-DDE elevated ROS content and attenuated glutathione peroxidase activity. This was accompanied with inhibitions of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) at the mRNA and protein levels. ROS inhibitor supplement could significantly reverse these effects. Moreover, the addition of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, strongly reversed the p,p'-DDE-reduced Nrf2 expression and γ-GCS activity. Consistently, GSH content was in line with the alteration of γ-GCS. Collectively, the results indicate that p,p'-DDE treatment downregulates γ-GCS activity in HepG2 cells by inducing ROS-mediated Nrf2 loss. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol, 2014.",

However, comprehensive knowledge of their pollution in Chinese farmland and associated risks is still limited. In this study, 15 PAEs were determined in soils from agricultural fields throughout the Mainland China. The concentrations of Σ15PAEs were in the range of 75.0-6369 μg kg(-1). Three provinces (i.e., Fujian, Guangdong and Xinjiang, China) showed the highest loadings of PAEs. Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was found as the most abundant component and contributed 71.5% to the ∑15PAEs. The major source of PAEs in arable soils was associated with the application of agricultural plastic films, followed by the activities for soil fertility. Furthermore, the non-cancer and carcinogenic risks of target PAEs were estimated. The hazard indexes (HIs) of PAEs in all samples were below 1 and the carcinogenic risk levels were all within 10(-4). Results from this study will provide valuable information for Chinese agricultural soil management and risk avoidance.",

        "abstract": "Research increasingly suggests that enantiomer selectivity may be a part of the toxicological effects of chiral contaminants. In this study, we selected Japonica rice variety Xiushui 63 seedlings to evaluate the enantioselectivity of imazethapyr (IM). Significant differences in rice seedling morphology, antioxidant enzyme, oxidant marker and gene transcription were observed between the two IM enantiomers. In the seedling morphological assay, IM enantiomers inhibited elongation of primary roots and shoots, and reduced the number of adventitious roots and the density of root hairs. The inhibitory effects were enhanced with increasing concentrations of IM. The maximal root relative inhibition rate reached 80.4%, 67.0%, and 73.5% for R-(-)-IM, S-(+)-IM and racemate at the concentration of 0.5 mg L(-1), respectively, and the maximal shoot relative inhibition rate reached 77.7%, 26.9%, and 61.7%, respectively. The activities of SOD, POD and CAT and the content of MDA increased at 0.5 mg L(-1) of R-(-)-IM treatment, and were 1.8, 3.3, 1.4, and 2.2 times, respectively, over the activities S-(+)-IM. Real-time PCR showed that R-(-)-IM minimized the transcript abundance of ALS in shoot tissue to 12.2% of the S-(+)-IM, and minimized the transcript abundance of PC in seed to 9.2% of the S-(+)-IM. R-(-)-IM maximized the transcript abundance of beta-amylase in shoots to 8.6-time of the S-(+)-IM. Results from this study imply that R-(-)-IM has stronger toxicity on the growth of rice than S-(+)-IM.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis was applied to quantitatively evaluate the association between exposure to OCPs and incidence of T2DM and pool the inconsistent evidence.Publications in English were searched in MEDLINE and WEB OF SCIENCE databases and related reference lists up to August 2013. Quantitative estimates and information regarding study characteristics were extracted from 23 original studies. Quality assessments of external validity, bias, exposure measurement and confounding were performed, and subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the heterogeneity sources.We retrieved 23 eligible articles to conduct this meta-analysis. OR (odds ratio) or RR (risk ratio) estimates in each subgroup were discussed, and the strong associations were observed in PCB-153 (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.19-1.94), PCBs (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.53-2.99), and p,p'-DDE (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.15-1.54) based on a random-effects model.This meta-analysis provides quantitative evidence supporting the conclusion that exposure to organochlorine pollutants is associated with an increased risk of incidence of T2DM.",

On this basis, a method for the chiral separation and micro-determination of napropamide in water was established. The linearity of calibration curve for racemic mixture was 10-100 ng x mL(-1) and the correlation coefficient was 0. 99. When 10 microL was injected, the detection limit of racemic mixture was 8 ng mL(-1), and the detection limits of both enantiomers were 4 ng x mL(-1).",

        "abstract": "Single-particle properties of low-lying resonance levels in 14O have been studied efficiently by utilizing a technique of proton elastic resonance scattering with a 13N secondary beam and a thick proton target. The excitation functions for the 13N + p elastic scattering were measured over a wide energy range of ECM = 0.4 - 3.3   MeV and fitted with an R-matrix calculation. A clear assignment of Jπ = 2- has been made for the level at Ex = 6.767 (11)   MeV in 14O for the first time. The excitation functions show a signature of a new 0- level at Ex = 5.71 (2)   MeV with Γ = 400 (100)   keV. The excitation energies and widths of the 14O levels are discussed in conjunction with the spectroscopic structure of A = 14 nuclei with T = 1. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Therefore, a better understanding of the sources and characteristics of particulate matters (PM) and associated elements is crucial and urgent for haze controlling. In this study, air particulates were collected from six different functional areas in a megacity of the YRD, China in early winter of 2012. Highly time- and size-resolved analysis of PM-elements was conducted to trace their sources. Our results showed that the main donors to particulate elements were crustal dust, followed by traffic and industrial influences due to the mixed residential, commercial and industrial zones at most sites. Anthropogenesis contributed more to the sources of finer particles and associated elements than those of coarser ones. Besides the local emission sources, meteorological conditions also affected the distribution patterns of ambient elements. Furthermore, the risks of hazard metals in PM2.5 and PM1.0 to human health were estimated. The highest non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were observed at urban living quarter (ULQ) and eco-industrial park (EIP), respectively. In addition, the general risks at rural living quarters (RLQ) were the lowest. Results from this study may provide valuable information for air pollution control and management in the YRD, China.",

        "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a type of ubiquitous pollutant with the potential ability to cause endocrine disruption that would have an adverse health impact on the general population. To assess the maternal exposure to PAHs in neonates and evaluate the possible impact of PAHs on reproductive hormone levels, the concentration of PAHs and reproductive hormone levels in the umbilical cord serum of 98 mother-infant pairs in the Shengsi Islands were investigated. The median concentration of total PAHs was determined to be 164 (Inter-Quartile Range, IQR 93.6-267) ng g lipid, and 68% of the PAHs were lower-molecule congeners. The highest level was found for pyrene (PYR) and naphthalene (NAP), which contributed 54.6% of all the PAHs present in the samples. The exposure to PAHs negatively affected estradiol (E2) and Anti-Mullerian hormones (AMH) and positively affected FSH in the umbilical cord serum. The result expanded the database of the human burden of PAHs and suggested that PAHs can act as a type of Endocrine-Disrupting Chemical (EDC). These results may help to understand the complex pathways involved in disorders of human reproductive health associated with prenatal exposure to PAHs.",

The typical test pieces with preset delamitation flaws and the related test facilities were designed to test the compressive strength. The effects of the location and the size of the delamitation flaw are studied by numerical simulations combined with experiments. It is shown that the position of the delamitation flaw affects the delamitation form of the laminate and the small scale delamitation flaws do not affect the compressive strength. This conclusion is useful for the design and manufacture of the aircraft structures.",

Many investigations of astrophysical observations and BBN calculations have been carried out in order to solve the puzzles.

The BBN model calculations are then performed to investigate the primordial lithium abundance. The result shows that these nuclear reactions have minimal effect on the primordial abundances of 6Li and 7Li. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence.",

        "abstract": "Permethrin (PM), as a chiral pesticide, has two asymmetric centers, resulting in two pairs of enantiomers. In China, the commercial formulation of PM contains four enantiomers. The enantiomer-specific activity for endocrine disruption in mice remains unclear. In the present study, the four individual PM enantiomers were separated by preparative HPLC. Then, three week-old male ICR mice (after maternal ablactation) were orally administered (+)-cis, (-)-cis, (+)-trans, and (-)-trans-PM separately daily for 3 weeks at doses of 0, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The results showed that 100 mg/kg of (+)-cis, (-)-cis and (-)-trans-PM treatments resulted in serious testicular histopathological damage, decreases in testis weight and serum testosterone (T) concentrations. Moreover, the transcription status of some key genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and transport as well as T synthesis in the testes were also influenced selectively by PM enantiomers, especially by the (+)-cis-PM. Additionally, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) mRNA levels decreased significantly in the (+)-cis-PM group regardless of the administrated doses, while steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) levels were significantly down-regulated by (+)-cis and (-)-trans-PM. Moreover, significant differences were mainly found in HMG-CoA reductase, PBR, StAR and 17β-HSD mRNA levels between different enantiomers. Combined with the effects on physiology, histopathology and the expression of genes related to T synthesis, (+)-cis-PM showed the greatest endocrine disruption activities, (-)-cis and (-)-trans-PM were moderate, while (+)-trans-PM exhibited the lowest. These results suggested significant PM enantioselectivity in the reproductive toxicity of mice during puberty exposure.",

        "abstract": "The 13N+p elastic resonance scattering has been studied at the secondary radioactive beam facility of CIAE in inverse kinematics via a thick-target method. The excitation function for the 13N(p,p) scattering was obtained in the energy interval of Ecm≈0.5-3.2 MeV with a 13N secondary beam of (47.8±1.5) MeV. Careful analysis of the secondary beam components and extensive Monte-Carlo simulations enable the resolution of the experimental proton spectra. The resonance parameters for five low-lying levels in 14O were deduced by R-matrix fitting calculations with MULTI7 and SAMMY-M6-BETA. The present results show general agreement with those from a recent similar work, and thus confirm the observation of a new 0- level at 5.7 MeV in 14O with an improved width of 400(45) keV. © 2009 Chinese Physical Society and the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The results demonstrate that the recovery of failure strength of repairing specimens could reach 80% after double-sided flush repaired. The strength of repair specimens can be recovered to the maximum, when scarf ratio is 1:40, and covering layers number is three with the layer's orientation is the same as the mother plate's layer which is close to covering layers. Double-sides flush repairing is familiar to any thicknesses and any lay-up ways of the mother laminates. A 3D finite element analysis was studied to verify the test result using ABAQUS software. In the model, every layer was set as a section, then give it the orientation of each layer. The analysis data are agree with the test results.",

        "abstract": "Ecotoxicological studies have revealed the association between synthetic pyrethroid (SP) exposure and aquatic toxicity in fish; however, research on the toxic effects of SP metabolites is still limited. In this study, the toxicity of two SPs (permethrin (PM) and β-cypermethrin (β-CP)) and their three metabolites (3-phenoxybenzoic alcohol (PBCOH), 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (PBCHO), and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBCOOH)) towards zebrafish embryos and larvae was evaluated. Both SPs and their metabolites exhibited significant developmental toxicities, caused abnormal vascular development, and changed locomotor activities in larvae. The alteration of gene expression involved in the thyroid system and the innate immune system indicated that SPs and their three metabolites have the potency to induce thyroid disruption and trigger an immune response. The results from the present study suggest that SP metabolites could induce multiple toxic responses similar to parent compounds, and their toxicity should be considered for improving the understanding of environmental risks of SPs.",

The compaction behavior of the preform during the VARI process was discussed. And the effect of the post-filling time on the preform thickness and the fiber volume fraction was studied. The result indicates that the compaction behavior of the preform can be divided into three stages: the preform thickness increases rapidly when the resin is infused; the perform thickness is almost not changed during the post-filling; the preform thickness decreases rapidly and drives to a stable value after that the resin-inlet is clamped. The final part thickness varies with the post-filling time, and the variation tendency is similar to a sinusoid. The fiber volume fraction is the lowest and decreases 1.7% compared with that without post-filling, when the post-filling time is about 10 min. And the fiber volume fraction is the greatest and increases 1.6% compared with that without post-filling, when the post filling time is about 40 min.",

The angular distribution of 13N(d, n)14O at Ecm=8.9 MeV was measured using 13N beam produced by secondary beam facility at HI-13 tandem accelerator. The ANC of 14O was then extracted to be (29.4±5.3) fm-1. In addition, we derived the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of 14O by analyzing the 13C(d, p)14C angular distribution based on charge symmetry of mirror nuclei, which agrees with the experimental result. The astrophysical S factor and reaction rate of 13N(p, γ)14O were then calculated using R-matrix theory and were inputted into astrophysical reaction network. It shows the energy generated by CNO cycle in novae using the present data is 5% more than that using the previous ones, which could affect the evolution of novae.",

        "abstract": "Despite recent studies on enantioselectivity in acute aquatic toxicity and biodegradation of some pyrethroid pesticides, including permethrin (PM), enantiomer-specific estrogenic activity has been the subject of limited research. In this study, real-time quantitative RT-PCR was adopted to investigate induction of hepatic expression of mRNA of selected genes in male adult zebrafish after short-term exposure to PM enantiomers. The PM enantiomers were completely separated by a chiral HPLC column. The in vivo study found that a 2-day exposure to 100 ng/l PM racemate and its enantiomers was sufficient to stimulate transcription of two vitellogenin (vtg) genes, while 250 ng/l exposure significantly induced gene transcription in a pattern and content similar to that of the control (50 ng/l 17beta-estradiol (E2)). Significant differences were detected between the enantiomers in induction of hepatic gene transcription. At exposure level of 500 ng/l, the response to the (-)-trans enantiomer was 2.6 and 1.8 times greater than the (+)-trans enantiomer based on zebrafish vtg1 and vtg2 mRNA induction (p<0.05), respectively. Of the four enantiomers, the (-)-trans enantiomer showed the greatest estrogenic activity, with a relative activity 4-fold higher than the 50 ng/l E2 group. The results strongly suggested the occurrence of significant enantioselectivity in estrogenic activity of PM enantiomers. It would appear from our results and previous studies that using chiral pesticide as a single compound would increase the environmental risk of chronic toxicity, such as endocrine disruption, to humans and wildlife.",

        "abstract": "Growing concern over reproductive hormones in the environment demands sensitive and efficient methods by use of molecular biomarkers to detect these contaminants in oviparous vertebrates. In this study, a real-time quantitative RT-PCR was adopted to investigate the expressions of three estrogen-responsive genes, Vtg I, Vtg II and ERalpha, in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues of male adult zebrafish exposed to varying concentrations of 17beta-estradiol (E2) for selected periods. Without exposure to E2, all the genes were expressed in the tissues of male controls with their levels being much lower than those in the respective tissues of female controls. The expressions of hepatic Vtg I and II mRNAs were induced significantly after 1-day exposure to E2 at as low as 0.25 microg L(-1). Significant induction in the expression of hepatic ERalpha mRNA required a higher E2 concentration (> or = 0.5 microg L(-1)) and a longer exposure (> or = 2 days), suggesting that Vtg I and Vtg II are more sensitive to E2 exposure. The induction of Vtg mRNA in the skin of zebrafish was also significant following a short exposure (1 day) to low E2 concentration (0.25 microg L(-1)), with the levels of Vtg I and Vtg II mRNA being increased by 25 and 5 times, respectively. These results suggest that Vtg I mRNA is a highly sensitive biomarker for determining the estrogenic effects of E2 and that the skin of zebrafish may be an appropriate substitute for liver for such a determination.",

        "abstract": "Imazethapyr (IM) is a chiral herbicide and a widely used racemic mixture. This report investigated the enantioselectivity between R- and S-IM in rice and explored its causative mechanism at the physiological and molecular levels. The results suggested that R-IM inhibited acetolactate synthase (ALS) activity to a greater extent than S-IM, which reduced the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Additionally, most other amino acids showed enantioselectivity. On the cellular level, R-IM showed stronger toxicity against protoplasts than S-IM. A gene transcription profile analysis showed that gene transcripts in many metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis, starch and sugar metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle displayed enantioselectivity between the IM enantiomers. R-IM regulated more genes more strongly than S-IM. This study suggested that R-IM has stronger toxicity against plants than S-IM; this toxicity is caused not only by changing targeted enzyme activity and amino acid synthesis, but also by affecting gene transcription in other metabolic pathways directly or indirectly in an enantioselective manner.",

This work investigated the process of chiral separation and the assignment of the absolute configurations of malathion, malaoxon, and isomalathion using chiral high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with chiral detector-binding energy computations. Hydrogen bonding was found to be a very important factor in the chiral separation of isomalathion on Chiralpak AD, although it did not exhibit a significant effect on the chiral separation of malathion and malaoxon on Chiralcel OJ. Based on the sign of a chiral detector, the relationships between the cotton effect, optical dispersion and absolute configuration were established for individual enantiomers of malathion, malaoxon, and isomalathion. The elution orders of the enantiomers of malathion and malaoxon on Chiralcel OJ and the stereoisomers of isomalathion on Chiralpak AD predicted by binding energy computations were found to coincide precisely with those observed in the chiral separation experiments. The result suggests that binding energy computations can be used to assign the absolute configuration of the enantiomers of chiral compounds eluted on CSPs.",

In the previous studies, we found that BFOV exhibited a glucose-lowering activity following oral administration to type 1-like diabetic mice induced by alloxan and rats induced by streptozotocin, and the mechanism was not related to enhancing the insulin synthesis and secretion. Since the enhancement of insulin sensitivity is involved in one of the mechanisms by which vanadium exerts its anti-diabetic effects, BFOV has been further tested on fat-fed/streptozotocin-treated rats, a type 2-like diabetic animal model, in the present study. The results showed that 4 weeks of BFOV treatment significantly improved hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia, as well as increased insulin sensitivity index in the fat-fed/streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Furthermore, BFOV efficiently activated glucokinase, increased hepatic glycogen content and suppressed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression in the liver and kidney of the diabetic rats, which contributed to augmentation of hepatic glucose disposal and maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis. These findings suggested that BEOV had anti-diabetic and insulin-sensitizing effects in the diabetic rats, exhibiting the potential to be developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Atrazine, a highly toxic herbicide, is frequently detected in surface water because of its heavy application. Algae are among the aquatic organisms most susceptible to atrazine pollution in water. In the present study, the aquatic alga Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck was chosen to assess the acute toxicity of atrazine (48-96 h) in terms of gene transcription and physiological changes. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to quantify transcript levels of three photosystem genes in C. vulgaris. The diel patterns for regulation of the psaB (photosystem I reaction center protein subunit B), psbC (an integral membrane protein component of photosystem II), and rbcL (large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase) gene transcripts were successfully quantified. Results showed that atrazine reduced the transcript abundances of three target genes and that the abundances decreased with increasing atrazine concentration. The determined smallest transcript levels of psaB, psbC, and rbcL, which occurred at the highest atrazine concentration tested (400 mug/L), were only 34.6, 34.6, and 8.1%, respectively, of the control sample value. Exposure to atrazine increased the level of malondialdehyde by 1.74-fold (the highest value) in C. vulgaris, suggesting potential oxidative damage to the alga. The activities of antioxidation enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) also increased markedly in the presence of atrazine, with maximum increases of 1.82-, 1.59-, and 2.31-fold, respectively. These elevated activities may help to alleviate the oxidative damage. Our results demonstrate that atrazine is highly toxic to this alga and that real-time PCR is an efficient technique for assessing the toxicity of xenobiotic compounds in algae.",

        "abstract": "Enantioseletive toxicities of chiral pesticides have become an environmental concern recently. In this study, we evaluated the enantiomeric separation of salithion on a suite of commercial chiral columns and assessed the toxicity of enantiomers toward butyrylcholinesterase and Daphnia magna. Satisfactory separations of salithion enantiomers could be achieved on all tested columns, that is, Chiralcel OD, Chiralcel OJ, and Chiralpak AD column. However, the Chiralpak AD column offered the best separation and was chosen to prepare micro-scale of pure salithion enantiomers for subsequent bioassays. The first and second enantiomers eluted on the Chiralpak AD column were further confirmed to be (-)-S-salithion and (+)-R-salithion, respectively. The half inhibition concentrations to butyrylcholinesterase of racemate, (+)-R-salithion, and (-)-S-salithion were 33.09, 2.92, and 15.60 mg/l, respectively, showing (+)-R-enantiomer being about 5.0 times more potent than its (-)-S-form. However, the median lethal concentrations (96 h) of racemate, (+)-R-salithion, and (-)-S-salithion toward D. magna were 3.54, 1.10, and 0.36 microg/l, respectively, suggesting that (-)-S-salithion was about 3.0 times more toxic than (+)-R-form. Racemic salithion was less toxic than either of the enantiomers in both bioassays, suggesting that antagonistic interactions might occur between the enantiomers during the toxication action. This work reveals that the toxicity of salithion toward butyrylcholinesterase and D. magna is enantioselective, and this factor should be taken into consideration in the environmental risk assessment of salithion.",

Lipolysis was assayed by free fatty acids (FFA) released from isolated rat adipocytes treated with epinephrine. The results showed that BFOV, similar to insulin, concentration-dependently significantly enhanced the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]-glucose and the transformation from D-[3H]-glucose to lipid in isolated rat adipocytes, with the EC50 values of (0.31 +/- 0.08) mmol L(-1) and (0.49 +/- 0.12) mmol L(-1), respectively. Moreover, BFOV markedly inhibited FFA release from isolated rat adipocytes treated with epinephrine, and the IC50 value was (0.30 +/- 0.20) mmol L(-1). BFOV had insulino-mimetic effects such as enhancing glucose uptake and lipogenesis, as well as inhibiting lipolysis.",

        "abstract": "Field burning of crop residue is a common post-harvest practice to dispose of these agricultural by-products and for land clearing. Burned crop residues may effectively adsorb pesticides and thus influence their bioavailability in agricultural soils. The adsorption of clomazone by a soil amended with a burned rice straw (BRS) was measured. The availability of clomazone to barnyardgrass in the soil in the absence and presence of BRS was tested. The BRS was 1000-20,000 times more effective than soil in sorbing clomazone. The sorption of clomazone by soil increased with increasing BRS amount in the soil. In a bioassay, the injury of barnyardgrass 9 days after planting decreased with increasing BRS amount in soil indicating the effect of BRS on clomazone availability. Residual analyses showed higher concentrations of clomazone in soils receiving higher rates of the herbicide than in soils with lower application rates suggesting the adsorptive role of BRS. At typical application rate of clomazone (0.3 microg g(-1)), BRS amounts of 0.02 wt.% and higher caused an appreciable reduction to a complete loss in clomazone availability. Calculations suggest that field burning of rice straw may result in sufficiently high amounts (>0.02 wt.%) of BRS, and hence contribute to often experienced loss of pesticide availability in agricultural soils. Our results may be extended to field situations where other crop residues and vegetation are burned. Alternative management of crop residues may improve the bioavailability of pesticides in agricultural soils.",

The optimized cell parameters were in good agreement with related experimental data. Electronic structure analysis revealed that α-PbO2-type TiO2 was an indirect wide-band semiconductor with a band gap of 2.47 eV, lager than the anatase TiO2 band gap, which may be caused by lower crystal symmetry, the average longer Ti-O band length and the weaker extent of mixing of the Ti3d and O2p orbits of high-pressure orthorhombic α-PbO2-type TiO2. It was theoretically suggested that photocatalytic effect of α-PbO2-type TiO2 was not as good as that of anatase TiO2.",

        "abstract": "17β-Estradiol (E2) is known to contribute significantly a large extent to the estrogenicity in aquatic system. In the present study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS), combined with histopathological analysis, was used to screen hepatic responses in adult male zebrafish. Eight proteins were found to be up-regulated more than 2-fold, whereas five protein spots were down-regulated more than 2-fold after 1nM E2 treatment for 14 days, which had caused histological effects in zebrafish livers. These differentially expressed proteins accounted for a variety of cellular biological processes, such as response to oxidative stress, cell surface receptor-linked signal transduction, oxidation-reduction and cellular calcium ion homeostasis. The results demonstrated that E2 comprehensively influenced a variety of cellular and biological processes in zebrafish. Moreover, the proteomic responses elicited in zebrafish allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)-induced toxicity fully.",

Compound 2 reacted with iPrNCO and (4-MeOC6 H4 )C(O)Me, respectively, with cleavage of the C=O double bond. In the first instance, O and iPrNC insert separately into the Ge-B bond to yield a GeBC2 O-heterocycle (3) and a GeBC3 -heterocycle (4). In the second case (4-MeOC6 H4 )(Me)C inserts into the Ge-N bond of 2 while O is incorporated in the Ge-B bond to form a Ge-centered spiroheterocycle (5). The reaction of 2 with tBuNC to give 6, which has almost the same structure as 4, proved the formation of the isonitrile during transformation from 2 and iPrNCO to 3 and 4. The kinetic study of the reaction of 2 and iPrNCO gave evidence of proceeding through a GeBC3 O-heterocycle intermediate. In addition, a DFT study was performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

        "abstract": "Previous in vivo studies have suggested that prenatal exposure to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is endocrine disrupting, and may cause adverse health risks to newborns. In this cross-sectional study, non-invasive cord serum samples were collected from maternal-neonate pairs of an island population. Concentrations of DDT and its metabolites were analyzed to provide insights into the environmental exposure patterns and to elucidate their effects on birth outcomes. The average concentrations of p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT and total DDTs were 0.463, 0.293, 0.089, 0.098, 0.441 and 1.384μgg lipid weight, respectively. Several maternal characteristics were identified as influencing factors on the environmental exposure distribution. The isomer ratios of individual components and the enantiomeric patterns of o,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDT indicated that historical technical DDT remains the predominant exposure source, though new sources of dicofol-type of DDT pollution must not be ignored. Using multivariable linear regression, increasing p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDT levels were found to be significantly associated with an increase in neonatal birth weight, which deserves additional attention to obesity risks. No other birth outcome was found to be significant regarding DDT exposure. These findings raise the awareness of the prenatal risk of DDT and its metabolites among infants in contaminated areas.",

        "abstract": "Benzophenone (BP)-type UV filters have been widely used in many personal care products to protect human from UV exposure. Their dermal applications can cause direct human health risk following accumulation in bloodstream. Few studies have addressed whether BP-type UV filters could bind and alter the structure and function of human serum albumin (HSA), the major carrier protein in plasma. Four benzophenones, BP-1, BP-2, BP-3 and BP-8 were selected to investigate their potentially toxic interactions with HSA and the intrinsic binding mechanism using combined spectroscopies and molecular docking techniques. Four benzophenones significantly quench the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA via static mode. The competitive binding fluorescence assay and molecular docking both revealed that the benzophenones bind at site II of HSA. Their binding constants range from 1.91 × 10(4)M(-1) to 12.96 × 10(4)M(-1) at 296 K. BP-8 interacts with HSA mainly through hydrogen bonding interactions and van der Waals interactions, while hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions are dominant for interactions between BP-1, BP-2, BP-3 and HSA. Molecular docking revealed that the changes in structural moiety and hydrophobicity of four benzophenones account for their different binding affinities. As further revealed by circular dichroism and time-resolved fluorescence decay, these benzophenones cause global and local structural changes of HSA, which illustrates their potential toxicity to cause structural damage of HSA. Two degradation products of BP-3 have higher binding affinities to HSA, suggesting higher potencies in causing adverse effects on human health.",

In the study, the occurrence, distribution, estrogenic activity and risk of eight xenoestreogens were evaluated in Lake Donghu, China. Nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP), and bisphenol A (BPA) were identified as the main xenoestrogens ranging from tens of ngL(-1) (in the surface water) or ng g(-1)dw (in the suspended particles and sediment) to tens of μgL(-1) or μg g(-1)dw. The sum of 17β-estradiol equivalents (∑EEQs) ranged from 0.32 to 45.02 ngL(-1) in the surface water, 0.53 to 71.86 ng g(-1)dw in the suspended particles, and 0.09 to 24.73 ng g(-1)dw in the sediment. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was determined as the main contributor to ∑EEQs followed by NP. The risk assessment showed a higher risk in the surface water than in the suspended particles and sediment in such domestic sewage-holding lake.",

And they were classified as Ann Arbor stage I (n = 8), stage II (n = 2) and stage IV (n = 11). There were B symptoms (n = 4), extranodal involvement outside testis (n = 12) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at diagnosis (n = 6). The scores of international prognostic index (IPI) were 0-1 point (n = 10), 3 points (n = 10) and 4 points (n = 1). The regimens included orchidectomy as the initial treatment (n = 15), chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (n = 7) and CNS prophylaxis during treatment (n = 15). All patients were pathologically diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. And 11 cases belonged to the non-germinal center B cell-like subgroup.First-line chemotherapy was either R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) or CHOP-like-based regimen. Complete response was achieved in 85.7% of patients. The median follow-up period was 18 (6-58) months. The 1, 2 and 3-year survival rates were 100%, 80% and 60% respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the first-line chemotherapy with rituximab was a prognostic factor (P = 0.038).Other factors included stage (P = 0.275), LDH level (P = 0.179) , β2-microglobulin level (P = 0.229) and IPI (P = 0.275) .The prognosis of primary testicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually poor. The first-line chemotherapy with rituximab is a prognostic factor.",

The optical\npotential of 6Li+7Li was obtained by fitting the elastic scattering\ndifferential cross sections. Based on the distorted wave Born approximation\n(DWBA) analysis, spectroscopic factors of 7Li=6Li+n were determined to be 0.73\n+- 0.05 and 0.90 +- 0.09 for the ground and first exited states in 7Li,\nrespectively. Using the spectroscopic factors, the cross sections of the\n6Li(n,g)7Li direct neutron capture reactions and the astrophysical 6Li(n,g)7Li\nreaction rates were derived.",

The NAMs such as jadeites, garnets, rutiles and quarts in ultra-high pressure (UHP) jadeite quartzites of Shuanghe and Bixiling areas from Dabie mountains were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the result of which indicates that NAMs contain hydrogen occurring as hydroxyl (OH-) or molecule H2O. It is found that the average structural water contents of the jadeites from the two areas are both close to 1000 × 10-6; the rutilezs are both above 2000 × 10-6; the quarts are both <4 × 10-6. The structural water contents of garnets from different grains in the same area arent uniform, while the water contents of UHP jadeite quartzites from the two areas both range from 900 × 10-6 to 1600 × 10-6.The results reveal that the water in crust or protolith can be transported into the earths depth through NAMs in the UHP metamorphic rocks during the formation of the HP UHP metamorphic rocks.",

        "abstract": "In an attempt to utilize ozone effectively, a series of praseodymium-modified γ-Al2O3 (Pr/Al 2O3) was prepared via incipient wetness impregnation using Pr(NO3)3·6H2O as the precursor. The structure and properties of the catalysts were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Catalytic activity was evaluated by monitoring the degradation of succinic acid (SA) in the presence of ozone. The praseodymium modification can effectively enhance the ozonation activity of γ-Al2O3 upon SA removal. Increasing the calcination temperature of Pr/Al2O3 is disadvantageous for the catalytic process, whereas increasing the load of praseodymium is helpful. After three successive cycles, the Pr/Al2O3 catalyst remained stable in the catalytic ozonation of SA. Overall, the initial degradation rate of SA, as well as the saturated adsorption capacity of SA, were found to have a linear relation to changes of the surface hydroxyl groups of the catalyst. On this basis, we conclude that the significant enhancement of SA degradation using Pr/Al2O3 as a catalyst should be because praseodymium, in the form of Pr6O11, promoted the formation of surface hydroxyl groups. Hence, the adsorption was increased, and the degradation rate of SA was enhanced. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",

Although CP has been widely used in some provinces of China, it has received very limited attention toward its environmental behaviors, in particular, with regard to stereospecificity. In this study, the stereoisomeric separation and toxicity of CP were investigated. All of the four stereoisomers of CP were successfully separated by high-performance liquid chromatography on a Chiralpak AD column. The stereoisomers (pk 1 to pk 4) were distinguishable on their mass and circular dichroism spectra. The inhibition on acetylcholinesterases (AChE, in vitro) and the acute aquatic toxicity to Daphnia magna (in vivo) tested with optically pure stereoisomers of CP showed its stereoselectivity. The inhibitory potency toward AChE decreased in the order of pk 4 > pk 3 > pk 2 > pk 1. In comparison, the acute toxicity to D. magna was in the order of pk 3 > pk 2 > pk 1 > pk 4. The stereoselectivity was found to be isomer-dependent, with 1.1-18.1-fold differences (in vitro) and 1.2-13-fold differences (in vivo) among the stereoisomers. These results suggest that the overall toxicity of chiral OPs should be assessed using their individual enantiomers.",

        "abstract": "Large amounts of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) have been historically applied in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, China. Estimating the air-soil exchange of HCHs after >30years of restricted use is important for understanding their cycling in the environment. In this study, air and soil samples were concurrently collected in two seasons at agricultural and industrial sites from a megacity in the YRD region. The concentrations of HCH isomers and the enantiomeric fractions of chiral α-HCH were determined. The mean concentrations of ∑HCHs in soils from an agricultural area (AA) and an eco-industrial park (EIP) were 1.74ng/g and 0.652ng/g, respectively, in winter, and 0.723ng/g and 0.350ng/g, respectively, in summer. The mean concentrations of ∑HCHs in the air from the AA and the EIP were 31.2pg/m and 47.7pg/m, respectively, in winter, and 45.0pg/m and 50.0pg/m, respectively, in summer. The variations in spatial and seasonal distributions might be related to diverse geographical factors, soil properties and meteorological conditions. Source identification demonstrated that HCHs in most samples were residues from past use, which was further evidenced by the enantiomeric signatures of chiral α-HCH. A preferential degradation of (-)-α-HCH was showed in soils and summer air, while a preferential depletion of (+)-α-HCH was displayed in winter air. The values of the fugacity fraction (ff) of HCHs suggest a net volatilization from soils to air, but long-range transport may also partly contribute to the atmospheric HCHs according to the results from enantiomeric analysis. The human health risk assessments indicated an absence of noncarcinogenic risks and very low carcinogenic risks for HCHs in both soils and air to human health. Results from this study provide valuable data for assessing the fate and health risks of HCHs in the YRD region.",

In this study, the enantiomeric separation of imidazolinone herbicides, i.e., imazethapyr, imazapyr, and imazaquin, was investigated using chiral HPLC. The enantioselectivity of Chiralpak AS, Chiralpak AD, Chiralcel OD, and Chiralcel OJ columns for the three analytes was compared under similar chromatographic conditions. Chiralcel OJ column showed the best chiral resolving capacity among the test columns. The resolved enantiomers were distinguished by their signs of circular dichroism detected at 275 nm and their structures confirmed with LC-mass spectrometric analysis. Factors affecting the chiral separation of imidazolinones on Chiralcel OJ column were characterized. Ethanol acted as a better polar modifier than the other alcohols including 2-propanol, 1-butanol, and 1-pentanol. Although the acidic modifier in the mobile phase did not influence chiral recognition, it was necessary for reducing the retention time of enantiomers and suppressing their peak tailing. Thermodynamic evaluation suggests that enantiomeric separation of imidazolinones on Chiralcel OJ column is an enthalpy-driven process from 10 to 40 degrees C. This study also shows that small amounts of pure enantiomers of imidazolinones may be obtained by using the analytical chiral HPLC approach.",

        "abstract": "The cytochromes P450 are a large class of heme-containing enzymes that catalyze a broad range of chemical reactions in biosystems, mainly through oxygen-atom transfer to substrates. A relatively unknown reaction catalyzed by the P450s, but very important for human health, is the activation of halogenated substrates, which may lead to toxicity problems. However, its catalytic mechanism is currently unknown and, therefore, we performed a detailed computational study. To gain insight into the metabolism of halogenated compounds by P450 enzymes, we have investigated the oxidative and reductive P450-mediated activation of tetra- and trichloromethane as halogenated models with density functional theory (DFT) methods. We propose an oxidative halosylation mechanism for CCl4 under aerobic conditions by Compound I of P450, which follows the typical Groves-type rebound mechanism. By contrast, the metabolism of CHCl3 occurs preferentially via an initial hydrogen-atom abstraction rather than halosylation. Kinetic isotope effect studies should, therefore, be able to distinguish the mechanistic pathways of CCl4 versus CHCl3 . We find a novel mechanism that is different from the well accepted P450 substrate activation mechanisms reported previously. Moreover, the studies highlight the substrate specific activation pathways by P450 enzymes leading to different products. These reactivity differences are rationalized using Marcus theory equations, which reproduce experimental product distributions.",

        "title": "Visible light-driven iodine-doped titanium dioxide nanotubes prepared by hydrothermal process and post-calcination",
        "abstract": "Iodine-doped TiO 2 nanotubes (I-TNTs) were synthesized, characterized and evaluated in the photocatalytic degradation of phenol. The photocatalytic activity of these new I-TNTs is much greater than that of I-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles, pure TNTs and P25 under visible light irradiation, and the I-TNTs hydrothermally synthesized at 150 °C are superior to those synthesized at 200 °C. Abstract A novel class of iodine-doped TiO 2 nanotubes (I-TNTs) has been synthesized via a hydrothermal route using Degussa P25 as a precursor and subsequent calcination. The photocatalytic ability of the products was evaluated in terms of phenol degradation in an aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The structural properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra. According to the XRD data, I-TNTs are pure anatase, revealing a shift of crystallite phase for P25 from rutile to anatase. The surface area of I-TNTs is significantly larger than that of I-doped TiO 2 (I-TiO 2 ) nanoparticles, which is an important advantage of the photocatalysts formed with a hydrothermal procedure. XPS and UV–vis spectroscopy show that iodine was incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice, and such incorporation extends the photoresponse of TiO 2 from UV to the visible light region. As far as phenol degradation is concerned, the I-TNTs are clearly superior to I-TiO 2 nanoparticles, pure TNTs and P25. The photocatalytic activity of I-TNTs hydrothermally synthesized at 150 °C had a significantly higher level than that synthesized at 200 °C. This is attributed to the increase of reactive sites and the enhancement of mass transfer that result from the large surface areas associated with the tubular morphology. Additionally, the increase of Ti 3+ content also contributes to the improvement of photocatalytic activity of I-TNTs. Keywords Titanium dioxide Iodine Nanotube Hydrothermal treatment Photocatalysis 1 Introduction The photocatalytic splitting of water on a titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) electrode was discovered in 1972 [1] . Since then, TiO 2 has been studied with regard to its potential applications in environmental protection areas, such as air purification, water disinfection, hazardous waste remediation and water purification [2–4] , due to its outstanding characteristics, such as chemical stability, non-toxicity, low cost, and high level of efficiency. However, the anatase form of TiO 2 is photocatalytically active under UV light irradiation because of the large intrinsic band gap (∼3.2 eV). Thus, if natural sunlight is used for the photoexcitation of titania, only ∼5% of the incident radiation has sufficient energy for the photocatalytic process. In view of this, there has been a great deal of interest in the preparation of a TiO 2 photocatalyst that is capable of efficient utilization of the visible light that is the main part of the solar spectrum. The wide band gap limitation associated with pure TiO 2 has prompted environmental engineers and scientists to search for innovative solutions. Apart from modification with metal elements [5–8] , the doping of non-metal elements, such as nitrogen [9,10] , carbon [11,12] , sulfur [13] , boron [14,15] , phosphorus [16] , and halogen [17–19] , into TiO 2 has been regarded as an effective method to increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 in the visible light range because their impurity states are near to the valence band edge, and the doping elements do not act as charge carriers, thus minimizing the combination probability of photoinduced electron–hole pairs [20] . More recently, doping iodine into TiO 2 (I-TiO 2 ) has been the focus of attention [19,21–25] . Hong et al. [19] reported for the first time that I-TiO 2 extended its optical absorption into the visible region and considered that it was possible to achieve the substitution of I 5+ for Ti 4+ in a TiO 2 matrix. Subsequently, I-doped mesoporous TiO 2 with a bicrystalline framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal method, and the doped iodine in the titania matrix is completely positive and pentavalent [21] . In contrast, Su et al. [22] used Ti(SO 4 ) 2 and KIO 3 to prepare I-TiO 2 in a hydrothermal procedure and claimed that the iodine exists in both I 7+ and I − chemical states in I-TiO 2 . In addition, the experimental results reported by Tojo et al. [23] suggested that I 5+ substituted for Ti 4+ and was present in the I–O–Ti bond. Nonetheless, there has been no report of the modification of Degussa P25 with elemental iodine. Degussa P25 is a commercially available titania photocatalyst that has a high level of activity for many kinds of photocatalytic reaction. To date, the preparation of TiO 2 nanotubes (TNTs) from P25 with alkaline solutions has received much attention [26,27] , since they have extraordinarily large surface areas and thereby enhance the mass transfer of reactants. However, the significant limitation of the intrinsic band gap related to TiO 2 has not been improved, i.e. TNTs are generally not sensitive to visible light; therefore, the development of TNTs with an optical absorption edge in the visible light region is a worthwhile subject. Usually, impregnating calcination is employed as a useful technique for modifying TNTs. In this manner, the doping of N, F, and C is done after the preparation of TNTs [28–30] . However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of doping TNTs with iodine during hydrothermal treatment. The primary objective of this study was to synthesize I-doped TNTs (I-TNTs) via a hydrothermal route combined with iodine doping. After post-heat treatment, the photocatalytic properties were compared with those of I-TiO 2 nanoparticles, TNTs and P25 in the degradation of phenol in aqueous solution. Systematic characterization by methods that include X-ray diffraction (XRD), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra, was used to elucidate the relationship between the structure and the photoproperties of photocatalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts I-TNTs were prepared by a chemical process similar to that described by Tsai and Teng [31] . In a typical procedure, 4 g of P25 (Degussa) was mixed in 160 mL of aqueous 10 M NaOH containing 6 g of HIO 3 , followed by thermal treatment of the mixture at 150 °C or 200 °C in a 200 mL Teflon-lined autoclave for 24 h. The autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature. The sample was washed thoroughly with 0.1 M HCl and deionized water until the pH of the rinse solution was 7.0. The sample was centrifuged, air-dried at 80 °C, and finally calcined in a chamber furnace (CWF 1100, CARBOLITE) at 400 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min −1 for 2 h. The samples hydrothermally treated at 150 °C and at 200 °C are designated I-TNTs-150 and I-TNTs-200, respectively. As a control, TNTs-150 were synthesized using the same procedure without the presence of iodic acid. In addition, the reference I-TiO 2 nanoparticles were prepared as described [19] . Briefly, 50 mL of tetrabutyl titanate was added dropwise into a solution of iodic acid (5.28 g in 200 mL of water) with vigorous stirring. Thereafter, the resultant product was dried at 80 °C for about 24 h in air followed by calcining at 400 °C for 2 h. 2.2 Characterization The crystalline phase identification and structural analysis were done by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature with a Thermo ARL SCINTAG X’TRA diffractometer using Cu Kα irradiation at 45 kV and a diffracted beam monochromator operated at 40 mA. The surface area of the samples was measured using the BET method by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements at −196 °C with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 Analyzer, and the desorption isotherm was used to determine the pore size distribution by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The external features and morphology of the samples were obtained by TEM using a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV with 0.20 nm point resolution. XPS measurements were done with a PHI 5000C ESCA system with a Mg Kα source operated at 14.0 kV and 25 mA. All the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV from the surface adventitious carbon. In addition, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Shimadzu UV-2500 UV–vis spectrometer, with BaSO 4 as the background between 240 nm and 800 nm. 2.3 Photocatalytic activity measurements For the photocatalytic experiments, 1.5 g of TiO 2 catalyst was added to 1.5 L of 20 mg L −1 aqueous phenol in a water-jacketed cylindrical Pyrex glass reactor (diameter 16 cm; height 20 cm; total capacity 3000 mL) equipped with a 400 W dysprosium lamp (Beijing Electric Light Sources Research Institute, Beijing, China), which has a spectrum very close to that of sunlight, with 1000 mL of 2 M sodium nitrite as a filter for visible light [32] . The suspension was irradiated with stirring, and samples were withdrawn through a port at the top of the reactor. The temperatures of the phenol solution (22 ± 1 °C) and the filter solution (55 ± 1 °C) were controlled by a thermostat (THD-2015, Tianheng Instrument Factory, Ningbo, China). Samples of the phenol solution were withdrawn from the reactor at preset time points, centrifuged and passed through a 0.25 μm pore size membrane to remove any suspended solids. The concentration of phenol was monitored by HPLC (Agilent Technologies, 1200 Series) with an Eclipse XDB-C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm film thickness). The mobile phase was 50% (v/v) aqueous methanol. The eluent was delivered at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min −1 and the absorbance at 269 nm was measured. Finally, the decrease of total organic carbon (TOC), which confirmed the mineralization of phenol, was determined with a TOC-V CPH analyzer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structure XRD was used to identify the crystal structure of the TiO 2 samples (TNTs-150, I-TiO 2 , I-TNTs-150, and I-TNTs-200). As shown in Fig. 1 , no peak of crystalline phase relating to iodine was visible, and all samples showed peaks at 2 θ values of 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.0°, 55.1° and 62.7°, which correspond to anatase (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) crystal planes (JCPDS 21-1272). The diffraction peaks of TNTs-150 and I-TNTs are stronger and narrower than that of I-TiO 2 , implying the enhancement of crystallization of the anatase phase and the growth of crystallites. There is no noticeable difference between the I-TNTs, although the hydrothermal temperature is different. However, as given in Table 1 , the calculated lattice constants a and c deviate slightly from the bulk ( a = 3.781 Å; c = 9.498 Å) values of anatase. This is assumed to be due to the interstitial diffusion of iodine into the TiO 2 lattice, forming I–O–Ti bonds when the I-TNTs were fabricated [23] . Additionally, the starting material, P25 from Degussa, is a mixture of anatase (∼83%) and rutile (∼17%), while the TNTs are completely anatase. This indicates that the hydrothermal and post-heat treatments can convert the rutile in P25 to anatase via the formation of titanate. It has been confirmed that the TiO 2 nanotubes are derived from layered titanates. For the titanate structures, there should be peaks around 2 θ values of 10°, which correspond to the d -spacing of the layered structure [33,34] . To explore whether there remain titanate compounds in the final nanotube products, a small angle XRD test was done. The results in the insets of Fig. 1 show that titanate could not be detected, meaning that titanate is decomposed completely to titania during the sintering. 3.2 BET surface area of samples The surface area ( S BET ), average pore diameter, and pore volume of the samples are summarized in Table 1 . Generally, the surface areas of TNTs are larger than those of I-TiO 2 and P25. In addition, S BET decreases with increasing synthesis temperature (i.e., the hydrothermal treatment temperature) of the I-TNTs. Fig. 2 presents the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves of TNTs-150, I-TNTs-150, and I-TNTs-200. The isotherm patterns of TNTs are type IV with type H3 hysteresis loops according to the Brunauer–Deming–Deming–Teller (BDDT) classification, which is typical of mesoporous structure. As can be seen from Fig. 2 , the incomplete monolayer adsorption of I-TNTs shifts slightly toward a higher relative pressure value as the hydrothermal temperature goes from 150 °C to 200 °C, demonstrating that I-TNTs-150 has slightly smaller pores than I-TNTs-200. The BJH analysis of pore size distribution from the desorption branch of the isotherm reconfirms that the pore size of I-TNTs-150 is larger. Thus, the loss of smaller pores is responsible for the decreased surface area. 3.3 Morphology of samples The hydrothermal temperature has a strong effect on the structure and morphological features of the resulting samples. Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of I-TNTs-150 and I-TNTs-200, and the insets show the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and the enlargement of I-TNTs. The SAED patterns indicate that crystallites in the as-prepared samples exist as polycrystallites in the anatase phase. In addition, TEM pictures show that the I-TNTs-150 has predominantly tube-like structures, which are connected randomly in the tube arrangement. Also, I-TNTs-150 displays a clearer and more tube-like morphology than I-TNTs-200. The nanotubes of I-TNTs-150 are two-layer tubes with finite wall thickness, 20–80 nm in length, about 7 nm inner diameter and 10 nm outside diameter. Furthermore, the ends are open, which is extremely beneficial for adsorption and photocatalysis. Nanorods are formed when the hydrothermal treatment is done at 200 °C. Considering the mechanism of rod formation, one would expect the initial nucleation to be accelerated at a high hydrothermal temperature. One suggestion is that the layered structures are very thick due to the rapid growth of particles, resulting in rolling up into nanorods [35] . Another suggestion is that the tube-to-rod structure transformation, involving the oriented attachment of adjacent TNTs together with the local shrinkage of the TNTs by reducing the interlayer distance between the tube walls, occurs at a high hydrothermal temperature [36] . In either case, the nanorods grow at the expense of the internal diameter of nanotubes. The results are consistent with the differences in surface areas obtained by measurement of the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm. 3.4 XPS analysis The chemical state of any doping impurity is critical to the optical property, band-gap and the photocatalytic activity of doped TiO 2 . The XPS spectra ( Fig. 4 ) for I-TiO 2 and I-TNTs show peaks of binding energy (BE) for Ti 2p, I 3d, O 1s, and C 1s. To investigate the chemical states of titanium and iodine, we analyzed the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p and I 3d; results are shown in the insets in Fig. 4 . The Ti 2p peak is well fit into the peaks of Ti 3+ (∼457.4 eV) and Ti 4+ (∼458.5 eV). Ti 3+ on the TiO 2 surface can be created by a variety of methods, such as UV radiation, annealing in vacuo , ion sputtering, plasma treatment, and ion doping [37–40] . The existence of surface states of Ti 3+ can hinder the recombination of electron–hole pairs [21] , which may be one of the reasons for the improved photocatalytic activity. The molar ratios of trivalent titanium to the sum of trivalent and tetravalent titanium, abbreviated here as Ti 3+ /(Ti 3+ + Ti 4+ ), for I-TiO 2 and for I-TNTs-150 show a faint distinction in Table 1 , while the ratio of I-TNTs-150 is approximately 18% higher than that of I-TNTs-200. The assignment of the XPS peak of I 3d is under dispute. The peak of I 3d 5/2 at about 627.5 eV was previously attributed to substitutional I 5+ [19] . Recently, the feature seemed to be completely absent when the I-TiO 2 was prepared via a hydrothermal process. Instead, the peaks of I 3d 5/2 were situated in the region 623.6–624.5 eV, and the BEs were higher than that of HIO 3 (623 eV) [21–23] . After calculating the data reported here, we found that the BE of I 3d 5/2 for I 7+ and I 3d 5/2 for I 5+ is ∼5 eV and ∼3.5 eV higher than the I 3d 3/2 for I − , respectively. Fig. 4 explores the spectra in the core level for I 3d of our samples and the corresponding fitted curves. Each sample has two peaks: for I-TiO 2 , the peaks are observed at the BEs of 620.2 eV (I 3d 3/2 ) and 623.8 eV (I 3d 5/2 ). For I-TNTs, the peaks of I-TNTs-150 are located at 620.2 eV (I 3d 3/2 ) and 624 eV (I 3d 5/2 ), and the peaks of I-TNTs-200 are located at 620.4 eV (I 3d 3/2 ) and 624 eV (I 3d 5/2 ). Then, the difference values between I 3d 5/2 and I 3d 3/2 are 3.6 eV, 3.8 eV and 3.6 eV for I-TiO 2 , I-TNTs-150 and I-TNTs-200, respectively. Thus, it is more likely that the first peak of our sample is I − species and the second is I 5+ . 3.5 UV–vis absorption spectroscopy To study the optical response of doped TiO 2 powders, we measured the UV–vis absorption spectra of I-TiO 2 , TNTs-150, I-TNTs-150, and I-TNTs-200, results are shown in Fig. 5 . The absorption thresholds for TNTs-150, I-TiO 2 , I-TNTs-150, and I-TNTs-200 are estimated to be ∼390 nm, ∼433 nm, ∼406 nm, and ∼407 nm, respectively, which is in accordance with the yellow color of the I-doped samples. The optical absorption edge of the samples shows an appreciable shift to the visible light region after iodine doping. The band gaps of the samples can be calculated from the intercept of UV–vis spectra using the following equation: E g = 1240 λ and the results are given in Table 1 . 3.6 Photocatalytic activities Phenol, which has no absorption in the visible region and typically occurs in phenolic compounds, is commonly found in industrial wastewater. Consequently, phenol is chosen as a model target pollutant to assess the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 samples under visible light irradiation. Fig. 6 a illustrates the degradation of phenol in the presence of TNTs-150, P25, I-TiO 2 , I-TNTs-150, I-TNTs-200, and in the absence of catalysts under visible light irradiation, as well as the absorption of phenol on I-TNTs-150 in darkness. No obvious change of the concentration of phenol could be observed with I-TNTs-150 in darkness or without catalysts under visible light irradiation. I-TiO 2 , I-TNTs-150, and I-TNTs-200 all reveal a higher degree of photocatalytic activity than P25 and TNTs-150. Moreover, the destruction of organic pollutants should be regarded as an overall degradation process that ultimately involves mineralization of both the parent substance and its intermediates, and the TOC of the aqueous phenol solution via photocatalytic processes is detected to evaluate its degree of mineralization. The efficiency of photomineralization of phenol is shown in Fig. 6 b. There is a clear decrease of 85% for TOC of phenol after 4 h using I-TNTs-150 as the photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, which is notably higher than the values for TNTs-150, P25, I-TiO 2 or I-TNTs-200. It should be noted that the surface area of TNTs-150 is 252 m 2 g −1 whereas for I-TiO 2 the surface area is 127 m 2 g −1 . Although the surface area of TNTs-150 is about two times that of I-TiO 2 ; the degradation of phenol is greater using I-TiO 2 . The efficient photoresponse in the visible light region for I-TiO 2 , I-TNTs-150, and I-TNTs-200 is attributed to iodine doping. The action of iodine reduces the band gap energy by forming doping levels in the band gap of TiO 2 . Additionally, the doping iodine sites could act as trapping sites to capture the photoinduced electron, thereby efficiently inhibiting the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs [23,41] . As far as the iodine-doped samples are concerned, the photocatalytic activity of I-TNTs is much greater than that of I-TiO 2 , and I-TNTs-150 is superior to I-TNTs-200, achieving a nearly complete removal of phenol after 4 h, as will be discussed below. The crystallinity, surface area, and morphology can greatly influence the photocatalytic activity of titania [21] , which is widely believed to be phase-dependent. However, the phase influence should be neglected in our experiments, because I-TiO 2 , and I-TNTs are both in the anatase phase, and so the variation in photocatalytic activity cannot originate from the difference of crystal phase. The TEM images indicate that the tubular structure is connected randomly, which promotes the diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the photocatalytic activity by facilitating access to the reactive sites on the surface of the photocatalyst [21] . In addition, photocatalytic reactions are believed to take place on the illuminated surface. The tube-like structure increases the surface areas significantly and, consequently, helps rapid mass transfer of the adsorbed molecules from bulk solution onto the catalyst surface, causing the photocatalytic process to be accelerated [42] . Therefore, the greater surface area of I-TNTs favors intimate contact with higher visible light-induced photocatalytic activity. The molar ratios of iodine to titanium (I/Ti) should be a vital parameter that affects the photodegradation of phenol in the system. As shown in Table 1 , no obvious difference of I/Ti is found, although the rates of degradation of phenol are remarkably different, implying that the effect of iodine content should be discounted in these experiments. However, after reaction for 4 h, the efficiency of phenol removal by I-TNTs-150 is 11% higher than that by I-TNTs-200, correspondingly, 85% of the TOC is mineralized in the presence of I-TNTs-150, whereas only 74% TOC is transformed into CO 2 with I-TNTs-200. By careful analysis of the data in Table 1 , we ascertain that the higher Ti 3+ content should be responsible for the influence of the photocatalytic activity in this case, since the surface areas of the two I-TNTs are similar. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have developed a hydrothermal method for the preparation of I-TNTs with an anatase framework. I 5+ substituted for Ti 4+ in a titania matrix is proved to be an important factor in extending the photocatalytic activity in the visible light range. I-TNTs markedly improve the visible light photocatalytic capabilities of phenol degradation, and the highest level of photoactivity was observed for the sample obtained by hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C and calcinated at 400 °C. This is because the I-TNTs-150 has the highest Ti 3+ content, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole. It also has the greatest surface area with a tubular structure. Such a structure affords more reactive sites and improves the mass transfer of organic reactants from bulk solution to the surface of catalysts. The materials described here may be helpful in new efforts for the preparation and characterization of excellent visible light response TiO 2 photocatalysts.

In this study, we carried out a nation-wide sampling campaign across China to investigate the distribution and abundances of 8 major ARGs in agricultural soils. The levels of sulfonamide (sul) and tetracycline (tet) resistance genes in China's agricultural soils ranged from 10-10 to 10-10 gene copies/16S rRNA gene copies, respectively. Northeast China is the hot-spot of ARGs, likely due to long-term wastewater irrigation in the area. Redundancy analysis was further performed to assess the influences of environmental variables on ARG abundances. Sulfonamide resistance genes displayed strong correlations with meteorological parameters (mean annual precipitation and temperature), and decreased from north to south. In comparison, tetracycline resistance genes were more closely related to soil organic matter and pH. Co-selection between heavy metals and ARGs was significant among Cu, Hg and sulfonamide resistance genes. This study highlighted the current status of ARG contamination and their influencing factors in China's agricultural soils. Findings are valuable to identify effective management options for reducing the release of antibiotics and control ARG spread in the agriculture sector across the world.",

Using the best fitted diffuseness parameters, the correlations of the real part parameters with A  1 1/3  + A 2 1/3  and incident energy are revealed, and the systematic Woods-Saxon potential parameters are presented for nucleus-nucleus interaction. The proposed potential parameters can reproduce not only the elastic scattering angular distributions induced by 12C, but also many elastic scattering angular distributions induced by the projectiles other than 12C, thus providing important inputs for the study of nuclear reactions of heavy-ion systems.",

        "abstract": "More than 30% of the registered pesticides are chiral with one or more chiral centers and exist as two or more enantiomers. The frequency of chiral chemicals and their environmental safety has been considered in their risk assessment in recent decades. Despite the fact that metabolic disturbance is an important sensitive molecular initiating event of toxicology effects, the potential mechanisms of how chiral compounds affect metabolism phenotypes in organisms remain unclear. As a typical chiral pesticide, metalaxyl is an acylalanine fungicide with systemic function. Although the fungicidal activity almost comes from the R-enantiomer, the toxicity of both enantiomers in animals and human beings is not yet clear. In this study, a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach was adopted to evaluate the enantioselectivity in metabolic perturbations in adolescent rats. On the basis of multivariate statistical results, stable and evident metabolic profiles of the enantiomers were obtained. When rats were exposed to R-metalaxyl, the significantly perturbed metabolic pathways were biosynthesis of valine, leucine, and isoleucine, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, and metabolism of glycerolipid. In contrast, more significantly perturbed metabolic pathways were obtained when the rats were exposed to S-metalaxyl, including glycolysis, biosynthesis of valine, leucine, and isoleucine, metabolism of glycine, serine, and threonine, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, metabolism of glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid. These abnormal metabolic pathways were closely related to liver metabolism. These results offer more detailed information about the enantioselective metabolic effects of metalaxyl in adolescent development and provide data for the health risk assessment of metalaxyl at molecular level.",

The critical problem in achieving practical application of PAC involves simple, effective fabrication of magnetic PAC and the design of a feasible reactor that can remove pollutants and recover the adsorbent efficiently. Herein, we show that such materials can be fabricated by the combination of PAC and magnetic FeO with chitosan-Fe hydrogel through a simple co-precipitation method. According to the characterization results, CS-Fe/FeO/PAC with different micrometers in size exhibited excellent magnetic properties. The adsorption of tetracycline was fast and efficient, and 99.9% removal was achieved in 30 min. It also possesses good usability and stability to co-existing ions, organics, and different pH values due to its dispersive interaction nature. Finally, the prepared CS-Fe/FeO/PAC also performed well in the fluidized bed reactor with electromagnetic separation function. It could be easily separated by applying a magnetic field and was effectively in situ regenerated, indicating a potential of practical application for the removal of pollutants from water.",

The concentrations of DDTs, HCHs, and chlordanes varied from 7.27-26.62, 2.67-3.35, and 0.54-0.61 ng/g wet weight, respectively, with the estimated daily intake far below the acceptable daily intake and Chinese edible hygienic criteria. Data from the tissue distribution suggested a tendency of DDTs and chlordanes to accumulate in the liver, but for HCHs, direct gill penetration may be an important means of entrance. In addition, the compositional profiles indicated that the residues of HCHs and chlordanes mainly originated from the historical usage of these chemicals. However, the predominant maternal compounds and the o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT ratios reflected a recent use of dicofol.",

A systematic formula has been proposed to calculate β −-decay half-lives of neutron-rich nuclei, with a particular consideration on shell and pair effects, the decay energy Q as well as the nucleon numbers (Z, N). Although the formula has relatively few parameters, it reproduces the experimental —decay half-lives of neutron-rich nuclei very well. The predicted half-lives for the r-process relevant nuclei obtained with the current formula serve as reliable input in the r-process model calculations.",

Resulting data indicated that the herbicide was stable in the acidic and nearly neutral solutions for at least 15 d. The herbicide diclofop-methyl rapidly dissipated in the natural aquatic systems and soil suspensions with half-lives less than 4 d. Methyl-CD (partially methylated beta-cyclodextrin) improved its hydrolytic degradation in the pH 8 deionized water and natural aquatic systems while humic acid inhibited its hydrolytic degradation at the same conditions. But dissolved organic matter in the natural aquatic systems and soil suspensions increased its hydrolysis. Two catalysis mechanisms were introduced to describe the effects of cyclodextrin and organic matter on its hydrolytic metabolism. Though inorganic ions maybe improved its hydrolysis reaction in the natural aquatic systems, Fe2+ and Cu2+ did not form complexes with the herbicide and had poor influences on its hydrolytic degradation whether cyclodextrin was added or not.",

Secondly,it is demonstrated and analyzed by equity,property right,public goods and external economy theory at present that compensation funds assignation of non-commercial forest is unfair,and that owner of non-commercial forest does not obtain income of property right in China. Government must solve the question. Thirdly,the author discusses influence factors of compensation funds allocation,including cost,quality,demand degree,importance degree,area,loss of non-commercial forest and so on. Finally,the paper expounds account method of compensation funds assignation standard. Author put forward that compensation funds assignation standard of state non-commercial forest is ascertained by cost account,and that the standard of other non-commercial forest is ascertained by loss account. Therefore,it is necessary to establish fair and reasonable assignation mechanism of compensation funds in order to inspirit construction and protection of non-commercial forest,and improve environment.",

As the industry develops, increasing numbers of chiral insecticides and herbicides will be introduced into use, potentially posing toxic effects on nontarget living beings. Chiral pesticides, including herbicides such as acylanilides, phenoxypropanoic acids, and imidazolinones, and insecticides such as synthetic pyrethroids, organophosphates, and DDT often behave enantioselectively during agricultural use. These compounds also pose unpredictable enantioselective ecological threats to nontarget living beings and/or humans, affecting the food chain and entire ecosystems. Thus, to investigate the enantioselective toxic effects of chiral insecticides and herbicides is necessary during environmental protection. The environmental toxicology of chiral pesticides, especially the findings obtained from studies conducted in our laboratory during the past 10 years, is reviewed.",

        "abstract": "The 95Zr(n,gamma)96Zr reaction cross section is crucial in the modelling of s-process nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch stars because it controls the operation of the branching point at the unstable 95Zr and the subsequent production of 96Zr. We have carried out the measurement of the 94Zr(18O,16O) and 90Zr(18O,16O) reactions and obtained the gamma-decay probability ratio of 96Zr* and 92Zr* to determine the 95Zr(n,gamma)96Zr reaction cross sections with the surrogate ratio method. Our deduced maxwellian-averaged cross section of 66+-16 mb at 30 keV is close to the value recommended by Bao et al. (2000), but 30% and more than a factor of two larger than the values proposed by Toukan u0026 Kappeler (1990) and Lugaro et al. (2014), respectively, and routinely used in s-process models. We tested the new rate in stellar models with masses between 2 and 6 Msun and metallicities 0.014 and 0.03. The largest changes - up 80% variations in 96Zr - are seen in models of mass 3-4 Msun, where the 22Ne neutron source is mildly activated. The new rate can still provide a match to data from meteoritic stardust silicon carbide grains, provided the maximum mass of the parent stars is below 4 Msun, for a metallicity of 0.03.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, three different repair methods to restore the mechanical performance of composite honeycomb sandwich panels with different initial damages are studied, and an experimental study was conducted to compare the lateral compressive capacities of the repaired specimens. Test results demonstrate that all these repair methods can recover the lateral compressive strength of the specimens effectively, and the strength recovery rates are all above 79% as compared with the intact panel. The panel with the smallest initial damage has the highest strength recovery. Besides, the unsymmetrical repair structures should be handled cautiously to avoid the mechanical performance degradation induced by the additional bending moment. Based on the test results, a finite element model is adopted to investigate the lateral compressive behavior of the repaired specimen. The calculated stiffness, the ultimate load and the failure pattern are in good agreement with the test results. The numerical model provides an efficient repair design method for the composite honeycomb sandwich panels.",

The data were analyzed with 3P97 pharmacokinetic software to find the parameters. The results showed that the linear range lay at the 1 approximately 1000 ng/mL level, and the LOD and LOQ were 0.4 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL, respectively. It proved that this new drug candidate underwent disposition in rabbit plasma by a two-compartment open model at the three doses above, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained as the initial concentrations of three doses (C(0)) were 8.68 +/- 0.80, 20.04 +/- 1.92, and 28.88 +/- 2.32 mg/L, respectively; the areas under concentration-time profile from time 0 to 72 h (AUC(0 approximately t)) were 90.0 +/- 13.0, 251.3 +/- 45.3, and 396.9 +/- 61.1 mg*h/L, respectively; the terminal elimination half-life times (t(1/2beta)) 29.1 +/- 4.8, 35.2 +/- 7.5, and 29.4 +/- 2.8 h, respectively; and the total clearances (CL(tot)) were 0.026 +/- 0.004, 0.019 +/- 0.002, and 0.022 +/- 0.004 L/h, respectively. First order rate pharmacokinetics were observed for SM54111 with the doses used, and it showed a long retention and slow elimination in vivo, There showed no prolongation of the t(1/2beta) with larger dose, and the CLs of the three doses were proximate. It is reasonable to surmise that SM54111 follows first order rate pharmacokinetics, and no saturation was detected at concentrations from 2.5 to 9.0 mg/kg. This result suggested that SM54111 experienced an amiable procedure in vivo and was worthy of the further development.",

        "title": "Enantioselective degradation and ecotoxicity of the chiral herbicide diclofop in three freshwater alga cultures.",
        "abstract": "Aryloxyphenoxypropanoates are a class of chiral herbicides. They have a pair of enantiomers, only the R(+) form of which is herbicidally active. Diclofop, the model compound of these herbicides, is commercialized as the racemate of the ester form, diclofop-methyl, consisting of a 1:1 mixture of the enantiomers. This study evaluated the enantioselectivity in aquatic toxicity and biodegradation of diclofop and diclofop-methyl. The herbicidally inactive S(-) enantiomers of both diclofop-methyl and diclofop were similar to or higher than the corresponding R(+) forms in toxicity to algae, depending on specific species. Although no enantiomeric conversion occurred for diclofop-methyl and diclofop, the difference in the enantioselective degradation of these herbicides observed in algae cultures suggested that their application forms were an important factor determining their enantioselective environmental behavior. The cell permeability and heat treatment of algae revealed that the enantioselective degradation of diclofop in algae cultures was governed primarily by the facilitated uptake by algae, whereas the enantioselective toxicity was primarily governed by the passive uptake. These results suggested that the acute toxicity test such as the 96 h EC 50 was insufficient to assess the ecological risk of chiral pesticides because of the differential degradation as well as possibly differential action sites of enantiomers. From this study, it was concluded that the enantioselective degradation and toxicity of chiral herbicides may result in their ecotoxicological effects being difficult to predict and that specific attention should thus be paid to currently used racemic pesticides as less active or inactive enantiomers may pose higher ecological risks.",

On cereral ischemia model pretreatment with 0.018mmol/kg copper aspirinate ig significantly increased survival of animals and the density of intact hippocampal CA1 cells and decreased brain calcium concentration. Its anticerebral ischemia activity was superior to or equal to nimodipine.

        "abstract": "Nicotine is a natural alkaloid produced by tobacco plants, and the mechanisms of its catabolism by microorganisms are diverse. In the present study, we reported the mutation, cloning, and identification of two novel genes involved in nicotine degradation from the newly isolated Pseudomonas sp. strain HZN6. Transposon mutagenesis identified a HZN6 mutant in which the nicotine-degrading pathway was blocked at pseudooxynicotine. A 3,874-bp DNA fragment flanking the transposon insertion site was obtained through self-formed adaptor PCR. Two open reading frames (designated pao and sap) were analyzed, and the deduced amino acid sequences shared 29% identity with 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine oxidase from Arthrobacter nicotinovorans and 49% identity with an aldehyde dehydrogenase from Bartonella henselae. Both pao and sap were cloned and functionally expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli BL21. The pao gene encoded a novel pseudooxynicotine amine oxidase with noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and exhibited substrate specificity removing the methylamine from pseudooxynicotine with the formation of 3-succinoylsemialdehyde-pyridine and hydrogen dioxide. The sap gene encoded a NADP(+)-dependent 3-succinoylsemialdehyde-pyridine dehydrogenase that catalyzed the dehydrogenation of 3-succinoylsemialdehyde-pyridine to 3-succinoyl-pyridine. Genetic analyses indicated that the pao gene played an essential role in nicotine or pseudooxynicotine mineralization in strain HZN6, whereas the sap gene did not. This study provides novel insight into the nicotine-degrading mechanism at the genetic level in Pseudomonas spp.",

This study was conducted by examining the As concentration in colostrum and umbilical cord serum collected from 106 mother-neonate pairs living on Shengsi Island, facing the Yangtze River estuary and Hangzhou Bay in China. Average concentrations of total As in colostrum and cord serum were 18.51 ± 7.00 and 19.83 ± 10.50 μg L. One-way ANOVA analysis showed delivered ages and source of drinking water played significant roles in influencing the maternal exposure patterns. Correlation analysis indicated a significantly positive association between As concentrations in colostrum and cord serum. Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for other confounders clarified the dose-response relationship with a coefficient value of 0.23 and a 95 % confidence interval of (0.006, 0.492); p < 0.05. The calculated daily intake of total As for neonates through breastfeeding was in the range from 0.413 to 3.65 μg kg body weight, and colostrum As, especially the most toxic species, inorganic arsenic (iAs), would pose a risk to neonates.",

        "abstract": "Soil erosion leads to soil loss and affects the hydraulic and mechanical properties of soils, and as a result, the soil fertility, eco-environmental quality, and reliability of engineering facilities will decline. Thus, it is very significant to study the mechanisms of subsurface erosion of granitic under different natural environmental conditions. However, limited studies focus on the effects of combined erosion angles and flow discharges on the subsurface erosion amount. This study self-made a subsurface erosion simulator and designed a series of combinational conditions of different soil column angles (0°, 30°, 60°) and different flow discharges (25 l/h, 50 l/h, 100 l/h) to simulate the subsurface erosion phenomenon and processes of moisture migration within granitic collected from a collapsing erosion area in southern China. Results show that the subsurface erosion development in the soil column is a complex and progressive process with obvious preferential flow, which indicates the transportability of soil particles, and the processes of soil subsurface erosion change markedly along with the change of soil column angle and flow discharge. Moreover, the growth rates of wetting front and subsurface erosion amount will speed up along with the increase of soil column angle of flow discharge. The relations between the advance rate of wetting front and time since the beginning of the test demonstrate bilinear. The erosion amount has obvious fluctuation during the process of subsurface erosion in granitic due to fine particles erosion, reposition, pore clogging, and flushing.",

        "abstract": "In September 2009, we investigated the residues, enantiomer fractions (EFs) and biological risks of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), in three different depth ranges (0-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-15 cm) of sediments from 15 sites in Hangzhou, China. The concentration (ng g(-1) dryweight) ranges of HCHs and DDTs in surface sediments were 0.74-5.8 and 0.76-17, respectively. The vertical distribution of mean OCP concentrations was in the order of 10-15 cm>5-10 cm>0-5 cm and implied that the residues of HCHs and DDTs gradually decreased after they were banned. The residues of OCPs in the study area mainly originated from the historical OCP use. The isomer ratios of <alpha>-HCH (α-HCH)/<gamma>-HCH (γ-HCH) (0.10-7.6) implied that HCH residues were derived not only from historical technical HCH use but also from additional use of lindane in this area. The isomer ratios of o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT (51% of samples were in the range of 0.3-1.3) suggested that both dicofol-type DDT and technical DDT applications may be present in most study areas. The (+)-enantiomers of α-HCH and o,p'-DDT were more prevalent than (-)-enantiomer in most samples with the fractions contain different enantiomers greater than 0.5. DDTs, especially p,p'-DDE, are the main OCP species of more ecotoxicological concern in Hangzhou.",

Beforetime, people believe that plantation income is lower. However, in recent years, because of reduction of timber tax and fee and policy to support forestry coming on, plantation income rate have enhanced and private forest have developed speedily. It may be demonstrated in Fujian Province. Bankers and potential investors are afraid of plantation risks, for example fire and diseases and insects, and are short of confidence for plantation investment. To analyze plantation risk of Fujian Province by real data, the paper concludes that from 1993 to 2002, average nature risk loss of plantation is lower in Fujian Province. Nevertheless, if a private forest happens fire or has diseases and insects, he will lose. Therefore, government must establish system to decentralize risks.",

        "abstract": "Introduced in the early 1980s, synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) are widely used in controlling a multitude of agricultural and domestic insect species, but they are highly toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. To date, however, studies have not adequately associated enantioselectivity in biological behavior with toxicity, especially regarding uptake and chronic toxicity. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between chronic enantioselective toxicity and enantioselective accumulation of cis-bifenthrin (cis-BF) in Daphnia magna by 14C-labeled assay. The results demonstrated a clear enantioselectivity in chronic toxicity, for which 1R-cis-BF was evidently more toxic to D. magna than 1S-cis-BF. The lowest-observed-effective concentration in terms of survival and fecundity for 1R-cis-BF were almost 40- and 80-fold higher than that of 1S-cis-BF on day 7 and day 14, respectively. Further studies indicated that the accumulation of 1R-cis-BF was approximately 14- to 40-fold more than that of 1S-cis-BF in D. magna. This enantioselective accumulation also was consistent with the enantioselectivity in chronic toxicity of cis-BF. Thus, our results support the notion that enantioselectivity in chronic toxicity may be caused primarily by an enantiomer-specific biological process, such as uptake in aquatic organisms. This suggests that to properly assess the risk associated with use of SPs, the potential for enantioselectivity in their biotransformation and toxicity should be evaluated concurrently.",

        "abstract": "There have been great concerns about the persistence of steroid hormones in surface water. Since the concentrations of these compounds in water samples are usually at a trace level, the efficient enrichment of steroid hormones is vital for further analysis. In this work, a porous and hydrophobic polymer was synthesized and characterized. The composition of solvent used as porogen in the synthetic process was shown to have an effect on the morphology of the polymer, which was successfully used as an SPE sorbent for simultaneously enriching steroid hormones in surface water samples. The recoveries of the steroid hormones on the custom-made polymer ranged from 93.4 to 106.2%, whereas those on commercialized ENVI-18, LC-18, and Oasis HLB ranged from 54.8 to 104.9, 66 to 93.6, and 77.2 to 106%, respectively. Five types of steroid hormones were simultaneously measured using HPLC-UV after they were enriched by the custom-made sorbent. Based on these findings, the SPE-HPLC method was developed. The LODs of this method for estriol, estradiol, estrone, androstenedione, progesterone were 0.07, 0.43, 0.61, 0.27, and 0.42 μg/L, respectively, while precision and reproducibility RSDs were <6.40 and 7.49%, respectively.",

The SWCC uses several fitting parameters to express the best fit equations, and the fitting parameters depend on the experimental data. The reliability and predictability of SWCC are always being questioned. In this paper, Fredlund and Xing model is used to fit the experimental data of loamy sand and sandy clay loam in the UNSODA database, the fitting parameters values are discussed. Bayesian framework and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method are applied to estimate the uncertainty of SWCC from the errors and variance of the fitting parameters, and SWCC of different levels of confidence is obtained. Applications of the confidence on slope stability analysis are presented by a simplified finite element program.",

        "abstract": "Cypermethrin (CYP), a widely used Type II pyrethroid pesticide, is one of the most common contaminants in the freshwater aquatic system. We studied the effects of CYP exposure on the induction of hepatic oxidative stress, DNA damage and the alteration of gene expression related to apoptosis in adult zebrafish. Hepatic mRNA levels for the genes encoding antioxidant proteins, such as Cu/Zn-Sod, Mn-Sod, Cat, and Gpx, were significantly upregulated when zebrafish were exposed to various concentrations of CYP for 4 or 8 days. In addition, the main genes related to fatty acid β-oxidation and the mitochondrial genes related to respiration and ATP synthesis were also significantly upregulated after exposure to high concentrations (1 and 3 μg L(-1)) of CYP for 4 or 8 days. Moreover, in a comet assay of zebrafish hepatocytes, tail DNA, tail length, tail moment and Olive tail moment increased in a concentration-dependent manner. The significant induction (p<0.01) of all four parameters observed with CYP concentrations of 0.3 μg L(-1) or higher suggests that heavy DNA damage was induced even at low levels. Furthermore, several apoptosis- related genes, such as p53, Apaf1 and Cas3, were significantly upregulated after CYP exposure, and Bcl2/Bax expression ratio decreased, especially in groups treated with 1 and 3 μg L(-1) CYP for 8 days. Taken together, our results suggested that CYP has the potential to induce hepatic oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis in zebrafish. This information will be helpful in fully understanding the mechanism of aquatic toxicology induced by CYP in fish.",

        "abstract": "Chirality exists extensively in nature. Synthetic chiral plant growth regulators and other pesticides usually behave enantioselectively in phyto-biochemical processes. Chiral plant growth regulators regulate the physiological processes of plants enantioselectively, and chiral pesticides cause enantioselective toxicities or ecotoxicities to plants. On the other hand, these chiral agrochemicals can be absorbed and enantioselectively metabolized by plants. This review summarizes the enantioselective effects of chiral plant growth regulators on plants and the phytotoxic and biotransformation effects of chiral herbicides and several persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on plants. Together, this information on the interactions between chiral agrochemicals and plants might shed light on studies on the chemical and biological behaviors of chiral chemicals, and direct research into the selection of plants, which can potentially decontaminate the environment.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies showed that bis(alpha-furancarboxylato)oxovanadium(IV) (BFOV), an orally active anti-diabetic organic vanadium complex, could improve insulin resistance in animals with type 2 diabetes. The present study has been carried out to evaluate the effects of BFOV on insulin-resistant glucose metabolism using dexamethasone-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes as an in-vitro model of insulin resistance. The results showed that BFOV, similar to vanadyl sulfate and rosiglitazone, caused a concentration-dependent increase in glucose consumption by insulin-resistant adipocytes. Moreover, BFOV enhanced the action of insulin and completely prevented the development of insulin resistance induced by dexamethasone, leading to glucose consumption equal to that by normal cells. In addition, dexamethasone reduced the mRNA expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, while BFOV normalized the expression of IRS-1 and GLUT4. These findings suggest that BFOV prevents and improves dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by enhancing expression of IRS-1 and GLUT4 mRNA.",

        "abstract": "Benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers (BUVSs) are prominent chemicals widely used in industrial and consumer products to protect against ultraviolet radiation. They are becoming contaminants of emerging concern since their residues are frequently detected in multiple environmental matrices and their toxicological implications are increasingly reported. We herein investigated the antiandrogenic activities of eight BUVSs prior to and after human CYP3A4-mediated metabolic activation/deactivation by the two-hybrid recombinant human androgen receptor yeast bioassay and the in vitro metabolism assay. More potent antiandrogenic activity was observed for the metabolized UV-328 in comparison with UV-328 at 0.25 μM ((40.73 ± 4.90)% vs. (17.12 ± 3.00)%), showing a significant metabolic activation. In contrast, the metabolized UV-P at 0.25 μM resulted in a decreased antiandrogenic activity rate from (16.08 ± 0.95)% to (6.91 ± 2.64)%, indicating a metabolic deactivation. Three mono-hydroxylated (OH) and three di-OH metabolites of UV-328 were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS), which were not reported previously. We further surmised that the hydroxylation of UV-328 occurs mainly at the alicyclic hydrocarbon atoms based on the in silico prediction of the lowest activation energies of hydrogen abstraction from C-H bond. Our results for the first time relate antiandrogenic activity to human CYP3A4 enzyme-mediated hydroxylated metabolites of BUVSs. The biotransformation through hydroxylation should be fully considered during the health risk assessment of structurally similar analogs of BUVSs and other emerging contaminants.",

Five patients received radiotherapy after chemotherapy, 16 patients received CNS (central nervous system) prophylaxis during the treatment. Immunochemical examination was performed in 17 patients, 16 belonged to non-germinal center B cell-like subgroup. First-line chemotherapy regimens were R-CHOP and CHOP-like-based regimens. Complete response was achieved in 90.6% of the patients. The median follow-up period was 35 months (range: 2 to 106). The 1-year, 2- year, and 5-year survival rates were 85%, 77%, and 46%, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed that Ann Arbor stage (P = 0.004), IPI (P = 0.005), LDH level (P = 0.008) as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.02) were prognostic factors of survival, and IPI was an independent prognostic factor. Conclusion: The prognosis of primary breast diffuse large B cell lymphoma is usually poor. S IPI was an independent prognostic factor of survival. Copyright © 2013 by TUMOR.",

        "abstract": "The application and production of alternative plasticizers (APs) has been increasing in the last decade in replacement of conventional phthalates due to their toxicity. This calls for the development of non-invasive monitoring approaches to assess human exposure to APs. A method for the simultaneous measurement of exposure biomarkers of di(2‑propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP), di(isononyl)cyclohexane‑1,2‑dicarboxylate (DINCH), di(2‑ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHTP) and di‑2‑ethylhexyl adipate (DEHA) in hair samples was developed and validated in this study. Prior to the analysis, the hair samples were washed in acetone and ultrapure water and pulverized to powder. Further, a solid-liquid and solid-phase extraction, followed by quantification using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed. The method was validated in terms of recovery, matrix effects, carry-over, linearity, limits of quantification, within- and between-run precision and trueness. Satisfying results were obtained for all targeted compounds, except for mono(2‑ethylhexyl) adipate (MEHA), which was monitored only qualitatively. The optimized method was implemented in a pilot biomonitoring study with hair samples from 9 healthy volunteers. Detection frequencies of seven metabolites ranged from 11% to 100%. Mono(2‑ethylhexyl) terephthalate (MEHTP) and mono(2‑ethyl‑5‑oxohexyl) adipate (oxo-MEHA) were found in all hair samples. More hydrophobic monoester metabolites were found to be incorporated in hair to a greater extent compared to their oxidized counterparts. Obtained results show that the developed method can detect AP metabolites in hair, supporting the use of this alternative matrix in human biomonitoring.",

        "abstract": "We found that temperature and photoperiod significantly influence the transcription of the estrogen-responsive genes, vitellogenin1 (Vtg1), vitellogenin2 (Vtg2), estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) and estrogen receptor-beta (ER beta), after a 21-day exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), nonylphenol (NP) and EE2 plus NP (EE2+NP). In general, gene transcription levels were higher as temperature and photoperiod length increased. The mRNA levels of Vtg1 in EE2 (10 ng/L) and EE2+NP (10 ng/L and 25 microg/L, respectively) groups were induced more than 10(4) times both in 21 degrees C-12L and 30 degrees C-14L groups, but only 369+/-23 and 178+/-59-fold induced in 12 degrees C-10L group compared to the control, respectively. Specifically, when exposed to a high concentration of NP (25 microg/L) for 21 days, the levels of all mRNAs examined were significantly increased (p<0.05) in the 21 degrees C-12L and the 30 degrees C-14L groups compared to the controls. However, no obvious induction in transcription was observed in the 12 degrees C-10L group. The results obtained in the present study clearly elucidate that temperature and photoperiod greatly influence the effect of EDCs, and thus suggest that to fully define the endocrine disruption effects seasonal and/or climate change effects must also be investigated.",

        "abstract": "As a result of human activities, the pollution of metals is becoming ubiquitous in the environment. Among various toxicological mechanisms of action, metals have been considered as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) through interference with steroid receptors. However, information regarding the potential endocrine disruption of metals on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is especially scarce. In this study, a total of 16 metals were assessed for their GR/MR activities using luciferase reporter gene assay. None of the tested metals exhibited GR or MR agonistic activity, but a total of 7 and 5 candidate metals showed obvious GR and MR antagonistic properties, respectively. All 7 GR antagonistic metals [ BaCl, CoCl, CuCl, Pb(NO), LiCl, SnCl and ZnCl] inhibited glucocorticoid-responsive gene GILZ expression in J774A.1 cells. Further investigations indicated that the 5 MR antagonistic metals [ CdCl, Pb(NO), LiCl, MnCl and SnCl] antagonized aldosterone-inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation. Among these metals, Pb(NO), LiCl, and SnCl showed both anti-glucocorticoid and anti-mineralocorticoid activities. Comprehensive screening and evaluation of GR and MR antagonists and agonists among metals should be considered to better understand the ecological and health risks of metals.",

        "abstract": "Up to 25% of the current pesticides are chiral, the molecules have chiral centers, but most of them are used as racemates. In most cases, enantiomers of chiral pesticides have different fates in the environment. Knowledge of the function of amino acids of enzymes involved in enantioselective behaviors contributes to the understanding of the enantioselectivity of chiral pesticides. In this work, Aspergillus niger lipase (ANL, EC3.1.1.3) was chemically modified using bromoacetic acid (BrAc), 2,3-butanedione (BD), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), and methanal. The enantioselectivity of the enzymatic hydrolysis of 2,4-dichlorprop-methyl (DCPPM) was investigated by chiral GC. The results have suggested that histidine, arginine, and tryptophan are essential for lipase activity and might be involved in the catalytic site of ANL. In addition, histidine and lysine play an important role in determining the observed enantioselective hydrolysis of chiral herbicide dichlorprop methyl. The molecular modeling study revealed that the essential hydrogen bonds formed between DCPPM and catalytic residues of ANL might be responsible for the enantioselectivity of DCPPM. The loss of enantioselectivity can also arise from the fact that the modification of the amino acids may cause changes in both the nature of the ANL enzyme conformation and the binding pattern of DCPPM. Our study provides basic information for the exploration of the enantioselective interaction mechanism of enzymes with chiral pesticides.",

As a function of pressure, the monoclinic cell parameters were calculated and the compressibility coefficients are 0.002 6, 0.002 3 and 0.002 6 GPa-1, respectively. The bond length, bond angle and distortion variation were studied in order to obtain the information of polyhedral compression. The pressure-volume equation of state was considered in order to obtain the bulk modulus K0. Comparison between the calculated K0 values and the experimental data suggested that the model provides reasonable insights into crystallographic and physical properties of jadeite.",

The results showed that BPOV could significantly decrease the blood glucose level and ameliorated impaired glucose tolerance in STZ-diabetic rats. BPOV has been further tested on insulin, glycogen and serum lipid studies. The results suggested BPOV has glucose-lowering activity in diabetic rats, as well as improved the disorder of lipid metabolism in diabetes. BPOV had permeability above 10(-5) cm s(-1). It was suggested good lipophilic properties. The cytotoxicity of BPOV on Caco-2 cells was measured by MTT assay which suggested BPOV have higher effect on impairment of cellular associated with lower level capacity of cellular accumulation.",

In this study, the enantiomeric separation and biotoxicity of the two enantiomers of methamidophos were investigated. Successful enantioseparation of methamidophos using high-performance liquid chromatography on a Chiralcel OD column was achieved. As indicated by the optical rotation and circular dichroism detection, (+)-methamidophos was eluted prior to (-)-methamidophos. The t test at the 95% level of confidence indicated significant differences between the enantiomers in their in vitro inhibition toward acetylcholinesterases of bovine erythrocytes and Electrophorus electricus and in vivo acute aquatic toxicity to Daphnia magna. The in vitro assays showed that (-)-methamidophos was about 8.0-12.4 times more potent to the enzymes than its (+)-form. In contrast, the (+)-enantiomer was 7.0 times more toxic to D. magna in 48 h tests. The toxicity of racemic methamidophos was intermediate in both in vitro and in vivo bioassays. These results suggest that the biotoxicity of chiral OPs to nontargeted organisms is enantioselective and therefore should be reevaluated with their pure enantiomers.",

        "abstract": "A simple, rapid and sensitive synchronous fluorescence method is put forward for the determination of enrofloxacin (ENRO) in the pharmaceutical formulation and its residue in milk based on the yttrium (III)-perturbed luminescence. When Y(3+) is added into the ENRO solution, the fluorescence of ENRO is significantly enhanced. The synchronous fluorescence technology is employed in the method to determine trace amount of ENRO residue in milks. The synchronous fluorescence intensity of the system is measured in a 1-cm quartz cell with excitation wavelength of 328 nm, Δλ=80 nm. A good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the ENRO concentration is obtained in the range of 1.0 × 10(-9) to 2.0 × 10(-6)mol L(-1) (r(2)=0.9992). The limit of detection (LOD) of this method attains as low as 3.0 × 10(-10) mol L(-1) (S/N=3). The selectivity of this method is also very good. Common metal ions, rare-earth ions and some pharmaceuticals, which are usually used together with ENRO, do not interfere with the determination of ENRO under the actual conditions. The proposed method can be applied to determine ENRO residue in milks, and limit of quantification (LOQ) determined in the spiked milk is estimated to be 2.8 × 10(-8) mol L(-1) (10 μg L(-1)). Moreover, this method can be used as a rapid screening for judging whether the ENRO residues in milks exceed Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) or not. In addition, the mechanism of the fluorescence enhancement is also discussed in detail.",

Significant differences were observed\n between the two enantiomers in 72-h EC50 values and in both in vivo and in vitro relative Hill reaction activities. These\n observations indicate that the enantiomers of diclofop acid pose different toxicities to rice seedlings: the S-enantiomer is more toxic to leaves and the R-enantiomer is more toxic to roots. These enantioselective toxic effects on rice seedlings should be taken into account in\n chiral herbicide application.",

        "abstract": "Effects of copper-aspirin complex on washed platelet aggregation, thromboxane B(2) formation and 6-ketoprostaglandin F(1alpha) level were monitored by Born's and Terashita's methods, respectively. The influence of copper-aspirin complex on cytosolic free calcium was examined using the fluorescent indicator, Fura 2-AM. Copper-aspirin complex significantly inhibited arachidonic acid-induced aggregation in washed platelets. The IC(50) value was 9.6 micromol L(-1). Copper-aspirin complex significantly decreased arachidonic acid-induced thromboxane B(2) formation by 87.1% in washed platelets. Ten mg kg(-1) of copper-aspirin complex given intragastrically markedly increased the plasma level of 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha). Aspirin, however, reduced both thromboxane B(2) formation and 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha) level. In the presence of CaCl2 1 mmol L(-1), copper-aspirin complex (20, 40 and 80 micromol L(-1)) markedly lowered arachidonic acid-induced increase in platelet calcium from the resting level (270+/-36 nmol L(-1)) to 213+/-14, 170+/-20 and 135+/-17 nmol L(-1), respectively. In the presence of ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid 1 mmol L(-1), copper-aspirin complex (20, 40 and 80 micromol l L(-1)) significantly suppressed the release of intracellular calcium induced by arachidonic acid from 127+/-23 nmol L-1 to 108+/-17, 93+/-12 and 70+/-13 nmol L(-1).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We report on the production and testing of both evaporated and implanted fluorine targets to investigate their stability to irradiation by protons. We produced four targets by evaporating CaF 2  and LiF powder on Ta backings and three targets by implanting 30 keV  19 F ions into stainless steel backings; a     5    μ    g/cm 2  Cr protective layer was also evaporated on one of these implanted targets. We assessed each target’s stability by monitoring the     γ    -ray yields of the  19 F(    p  ,    α    γ      ) 16 O reaction. Our results indicate that the evaporated and implanted targets without Cr layer exhibited 30    %  ∼    75% and 13% deterioration after     ∼    2.5 Coulomb/cm 2 , 220–270 keV proton bombardment, respectively. The implanted target with protecting layer exhibited only about 2.5% deterioration, which can be regarded as stable. As we observed stability in one of the CaF 2  evaporated targets up to 0.25 Coulomb/cm 2  irradiation, this target was used to investigate the two resonances at       E    p    =  225     and 237 keV of the  19 F(    p  ,    α    γ      ) 16 O reaction; the resonance parameters we extracted are consistent with the values found in the literature, giving us confidence in our analysis methods and our understanding of the target fabrication procedures described herein. In conclusion, the implantation technique provides a unique means to produce fluorine targets capable of withstanding high beam intensities, which is one of the necessary technical developments for the JUNA (Jinping Underground Nuclear Astrophysics) project in China.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, an effective allelochemical on aquatic unicellular algae Chlorella vulgaris at physiological gene transcription level. Exposure to 2.5 mg L(-1) of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), which were 2.47, 3.24, and 4.27 times higher than that of the control, however, exposure to 4.0 mg L(-1) N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine decreased the activities of these antioxidant enzymes. An increase in malondialdehyde content and a decrease in chlorophyll content following exposure to N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine suggested that the alga was severely damaged and that cell growth was greatly inhibited. Electron microscopy showed that the plasma membrane was detached from the cell wall, the nucleus was condensed, and the structure of chloroplasts was disrupted, in response to N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine exposure. Real-time PCR showed that N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine reduced the transcript abundance of psaB and psbC to 3% and 1% of the control, respectively. These results demonstrated that N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine not only inhibited photosynthesis, but also triggered the synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to disrupt the subcellular structure of this aquatic organism.",

        "abstract": "Three different repair methods were adopted in the paper to restore the mechanical performance of composite honeycomb sandwich panels with different initial damages, and an experimental study was conducted to compare the edgewise compressive capacities of repaired specimens. Test results demonstrate that all these repair methods can recover the edgewise compressive strength of specimens effectively, and the strength recoveries are all above 79% of the intact panel level. In order to analyze experimental results, k-sample Anderson-Darling test was introduced to investigate the influence of process parameters on edgewise compressive strength of repaired specimens. Test results show that middle-temperature cure can hardly affect the edgewise compressive performance of repaired specimens. However, the edgewise compressive strength is higher for specimens cured by autoclave, but the improve extent is influenced by the effective height of the repair region. Besides, unsymmetrical repair structures should be adopted cautiously to avoid the mechanical performance degradation induced by the additional bending moment.",

        "abstract": "Imidacloprid, the major component of many widely used insecticide formulations, is highly persistent in soils. In this study, the sorption of imidacloprid by six soils as well as its photodegradation and hydrolysis in water were studied. The soils differed significantly in organic matter content and other physical and chemical properties. Sorption increased with increasing soil organic matter content but was not significantly correlated with other soil properties. Removal of organic matter via H2O2 oxidation decreased the sorption. By normalizing the Freundlich coefficients (Kf) to organic matter contents, the variability in obtained sorption coefficient (Kom) was substantially reduced. These results indicate that soil organic matter was the primary sorptive medium for imidacloprid. The low heat of sorption calculated from Kom suggests that partition into soil organic matter was most likely the mechanism. The photodegradation and hydrolysis of imidacloprid in water followed pseudo-first-order kinetics; however, the latter process needed a six-time-higher activation energy. While both processes produced the same main intermediate, they occurred via different pathways. The hydrolysis of imidacloprid was not catalyzed by the high interlayer pH in the presence of metal-saturated clays, which appeared to result from the lack of the pesticide adsorption in the interlayers of clays.",

Thus, an organometallic manganese-catalyzed C−H activation set the stage for silver-free C−H/C−C transformations with ample substrate scope and excellent levels of chemo-, site-, and diastereo-selectivities. The robust nature of the manganese(I) catalysis regime was reflected by the first C−H/C−C functionalization on amino acids under racemization-free reaction conditions. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies provided strong evidence for a facile C−H activation and a rate-determining C−C cleavage, with considerable contribution from London dispersion interactions.",

The 14N 0,1 proton spectroscopic factors were extracted to be 0.67±0.09 and 0.73±0.10, respectively. Using the 13C(p, γ) 14N direct capture S dc(E) factors derived by the spectroscopic factors, the direct measurement data for both 1 - and 0 - resonances were well fitted via updating the resonance parameters, and then the total astrophysical 13C(p, γ) 14N S(E) factors and reaction rates were determined at stellar energies.

        "abstract": "About 1% of giant stars1 have anomalously high Li abundances (ALi) in their atmospheres, conflicting directly with the prediction of standard stellar evolution models2. This finding makes the production and evolution of Li in the Universe intriguing, not only in the sense of Big Bang nucleosynthesis3,4 or the interstellar medium5, but also for the evolution of stars. Decades of effort have been put into explaining why such extreme objects exist6–8, yet the origins of Li-rich giants are still being debated. Here, we report the discovery of the most Li-rich giant known to date, with a very high ALi of 4.51. This rare phenomenon was observed coincidentally with another short-term event: the star is experiencing its luminosity bump on the red giant branch. Such a high ALi indicates that the star might be at the very beginning of its Li-rich phase, which provides a great opportunity to investigate the origin and evolution of Li in the Galaxy. A detailed nuclear simulation is presented with up-to-date reaction rates to recreate the Li enrichment process in this star. Our results provide tight constraints on both observational and theoretical points of view, suggesting that low-mass giants can internally produce Li to a very high level through 7Be transportation during the red giant phase.",

In this study, we examined the agonistic/antagonistic activity of a group of PFRs by three in vitro models (luciferase reporter gene assay, yeast two-hybrid assay, and E-screen assay). Molecule docking was used to further explain the interactions between ERα and PFRs. Data from luciferase reporter gene analysis showed three members of the nine tested PFRs significantly induced estrogenic effects, with the order of TPP > TCP > TDCPP, while TCEP and TEHP have remarkable antiestrogenic properties with calculated REC20 and RIC20 values of 10(-6) M or lower. Results from the luciferase reporter gene method are generally consistent with results obtained from the yeast two-hybrid assay and E-screen, except for the positive estrogenic activity of TBP in E-screen testing. Docking results showed that binding between ligands and ERα was stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. As a proposed alternative for brominated flame retardant, PFRs may have anti/estrogenic activity via ERα at the low dose typical of residue in environmental matrix or animals. PFRs with a short chain, halogen, and benzene ring in the substituent group tend to be estrogenic. Our research suggests that comprehensive evaluations, including health and ecological assessments, are required in determining whether PFRs are preferable as an emerging industrial substitute.",

        "abstract": "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with normal hormone signaling to increase health risks to the maternal-fetal system, yet few studies have been conducted on the currently used chiral EDCs. This work tested the hypothesis that pyrethroids could enantioselectively interfere with trophoblast cells. Cell viability, hormone secretion, and steroidogenesis gene expression of a widely used pyrethroid, bifenthrin (BF), were evaluated in vitro, and the interactions of BF enantiomers with estrogen receptor (ER) were predicted. At low or noncytotoxic concentrations, both progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin secretion were induced. The expression levels of progesterone receptor and human leukocyte antigen G genes were significantly stimulated. The key regulators of the hormonal cascade, GnRH type-I and its receptor, were both upregulated. The expression levels of selected steroidogenic genes were also significantly altered. Moreover, a consistent enantioselective interference of hormone signaling was observed, and S-BF had greater effects than R-BF. Using molecular docking, the enantioselective endocrine disruption of BF was predicted to be partially due to enantiospecific ER binding affinity. Thus, BF could act through ER to enantioselectively disturb the hormonal network in trophoblast cells. These converging results suggest that the currently used chiral pesticides are of significant concern with respect to maternal-fetal health.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the DICE regimen in combination with recombinant human endostatin (Endostar) in patients with recurrent or refractory DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Methods: DICE regimen were given intravenously for 4 consecutive days, consisting of dexamethasone 10 mg/d, ifosfamide 1 g·m-2·d -1, cisplatin 25 mg·m-2·d-1, and etoposide 60 mg·m-2·d-1. Endostar were given at 7.5 mg/m2 (i.v.) on days 1-14. Cycles were repeated every 3 or 4 weeks. Results: Between January 2009 and September 2011, 15 patients with recurrent or refractory DLBCL were enrolled: 11(73.3%) with primary refractory lymphoma and 4 (26.7%) with recurrent lymphoma. Two patients (13.3%) achieved a complete remission and 2 (13.3%) achieved a partial remission. The overall response rate was 26.7%. The clinical factors of gender (P = 0.011), International Prognostic Index (P = 0.033) and serum lactate dehydrogenase level (P = 0.011) had significant effects on overall response rate. The TTF (median time to treatment failure) and the OS (overall survival) time were 2 and 10 months, respectively. The one-year OS rate and the TTF rate were 46.7% and 26.7%, respectively. Myelosuppression was the major toxicity. WHO grade III/IV leukopenia and granulocytopenia were developed in 11 patients (78.6%). Conclusion: DICE regimen in combination with Endostar was well tolerated and its efficacy was mild in patients with recurrent or refractory DLBCL, probably due to these extremely poor prognostic patients.

The complex was characterized by a variety of physical methods, including X-ray crystallography. The X-ray diffraction analysis show a dinuclear complex of two six-coordinate vanadium centers doubly bridged by the oxygen atoms of the Schiff base ligand with a V(2)O(2) diamond core. The complex was administered intragastrically to STZ-diabetic rats for 2 weeks. The biological activity results show that the complex at the dose of 10.0 and 20.0 mg V kg(-1), could significantly decrease the blood glucose level and ameliorate impaired glucose tolerance in STZ-diabetic rats. That results suggested that the complex exerts an antidiabetic effect in STZ-diabetic rats. Furthermore, the complex ([V(2)O(2)(mu-O)(2)L(2)]) had permeability above 10(-5)cm/s. The experimental results suggested that the vanadium complex permeates via a passive diffusion mechanism. It was also suggested the complex with salen-type ligands has good lipophilic properties and better oral administration. The cytotoxicity of the complex ([V(2)O(2)(mu-O)(2)L(2)]) on Caco-2 cells was measured by a decrease of cell viability using the MTT assay suggesting that the chlorine atom at C4 of complex [V(2)O(2)(mu-O)(2)L(2)] increased cytotoxicity for vanadium complexes.",

        "abstract": "Pseudomonas sp. strain HZN6 utilizes nicotine as its sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. However, its catabolic mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, self-formed adaptor PCR was performed to amplify the upstream sequence of the pseudooxynicotine amine oxidase gene. A 1,437-bp open reading frame (designated nox) was found to encode a nicotine oxidase (NOX) that shows 30% amino acid sequence identity with 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine oxidase from Arthrobacter nicotinovorans. The nox gene was cloned into a broad-host-range cloning vector and transferred into the non-nicotine-degrading bacteria Escherichia coli DH5α (DH-nox) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (KT-nox). The transconjugant KT-nox obtained nicotine degradation ability and yielded an equimolar amount of pseudooxynicotine, while DH-nox did not. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that the nox gene is expressed in both DH5α and KT2440, suggesting that additional factors required for nicotine degradation are present in a Pseudomonas strain(s), but not in E. coli. The mutant of strain HZN6 with nox disrupted lost the ability to degrade nicotine, but not pseudooxynicotine. These results suggested that the nox gene is responsible for the first step of nicotine degradation. The (RS)-nicotine degradation results showed that the two enantiomers were degraded at approximately the same rate, indicating that NOX does not show chiral selectivity. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that both the conserved flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding GXGXXG motif and His456 are essential for nicotine degradation activity.",

The results showed that all cyclodextrins could form 1:1 inclusion complexes with fenoxaprop-p-ethyl in ethanol-water (the volume ratio of ethanol to water was 1 : 4), and the binding constants of the three types of cyclodextrins toward fenoxaprop-p-ethyl were in the order of KRAEB>KHP-beta-CD>Kbeta-CD. Between 298. 15 and 318. 15 K, the binding constants decreased with temperature increasing. The Gibbs free energy deltaG, enthalpy change deltaH, and entropy change deltaS determined were all negative, suggesting that the inclusion complexation is exothermic and can spontaneously occur by the balance of enthalpy driving and entropy opposing.",

SUVmax on PET/CT was evaluated by SPSS 13.0 for the associations with patient characteristics, prognostic factors, treatment efficacy and survival time.The median SUVmax was higher in non-germinal center B cell-like (non-GCB) patients than that in GCB ones (18.0(2.2 - 40.5) vs 11.6 (5.3 - 18.7), P = 0.039). No difference of SUVmax was observed between the patients with and without bulky disease (P = 0.539). SUVmax was not associated with such patient characteristics as international protein index, age, stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, lactate dehydrogenase, number of extranodal involvement and Ki-67 (all P > 0.05). No significant difference in median SUVmax existed between complete remission (CR) and non-CR patients (P = 0.312). The difference of SUVmax was insignificant for the patients with efficacy and no efficacy (P = 0.243). With the cut-off values of 10, 15, 20, the CR rate, response rate, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and 2-year overall survival (OS) rate were not different between the patients with SUVmax below and above cut-off value (all P > 0.05).The prognostic value of SUVmax on PET/CT is indeterminate.

        "abstract": "Pyrethroids are a class of widely used insecticides. Female animal studies suggested that pyrethroid exposure impaired ovarian function, which resulted in similar symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). However, it is still unknown whether this association applies to women. In this case-control study, a total of 172 POI patients and 247 control women were recruited in Zhejiang, China. The urinary concentrations of metabolites of pyrethroids, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) and 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid (4-F-3-PBA), as well as the serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) were determined. The associations of pyrethroid metabolites with POI and POI-related hormones were accessed using unconditional logistic regression. Higher urinary levels of 3-PBA were significantly associated with increased risk of POI [adjusted odds ratio (OR) =2.344, 95% CI: 1.193-4.607 for the highest vs. lowest quartile of 3-PBA, p=0.013]. Stratified analyses showed that each log increase in urinary 3-PBA concentration was significantly associated with an 51.0% induction in odds of being in the highest quartile of FSH and 28.6% being in the highest quartile of LH levels, while a 25.9 % reduction in odds of being in the highest quartile of AMH levels (All p for trend <0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first case-control study to report an association of pyrethroid exposure with increased risk of POI in women.",

        "abstract": "Chiral compounds usually behave enantioselectively in phyto-biochemical processes. With the increasing application of chiral herbicides, their enantioselective phytotoxicity to plants merits further study, and little information is available in this area. The purpose of this study was to examine the enantioselective phytotoxicity of the herbicide imazethapyr (IM) on the roots of maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings. Enantiomers of IM were separated by HPLC, and their absolute configurations were confirmed as S-(+)-IM and R-(-)-IM by the octant rule. Plant growth measurements and morphological, microscopic, and ultrastructural observations were conducted after treatment with individual IM enantiomers and the racemate. Observations of root morphology showed that the root diameter significantly increased, whereas the root volume, surface area, and number of root tips decreased significantly. IM enantiomers selectively damaged root hair growth and significantly reduced the sloughing of border cells from the tips. IM also had adverse effects on cell organelles, such as statocytes, mitochondria, dictyosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum in maize roots. Moreover, cell membranes and cell walls were thicker than usual after IM treatment. All of the results showed the same trend that the R-(-)-IM affected the root growth of maize seedlings more severely than the S-(+)-IM. The inhibition abilities of (+/-)-IM was between S-(+)- and R-(-)-IM. The behavior of the active enantiomer, instead of just the racemate, may have more relevance to the herbicidal effects and ecological safety of IM. Therefore, enantiomeric differences should be considered when evaluating the bioavailability of the herbicide IM.",

        "abstract": "Health concerns regarding the potential interference of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the immune system of wildlife and humans have increased in recent years. However, the effects of EDCs in aquatic systems on the immune system of fish species has only received limited attention. In the present study, we found that the mRNA levels of TNFalpha, IFN, IL-1beta, IL-8, CXCL-Clc, and CC-chemokine, which are closely related to the innate immune system, were affected in newly hatched zebrafish when exposed to EDCs, such as 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethynyestradiol, permethrin, atrazine and nonylphenol at various concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 2.5 and 12.5 microg/l) for three days during the embryo stage. However, the different EDCs displayed different potentials to change innate immune-related gene transcription. Among the selected chemicals, permethrin (PM) and 17beta-estradiol (E2) (12.5 microg/l) significantly increased the mRNA levels of many cytokines, exhibiting their most prominent impacts on the innate immune system of zebrafish. In addition, it was found that the mixture of the above five chemicals (2.5 microg/l each) had a greater effect on innate immune system-related gene transcription in zebrafish than equal amounts of the single compound. Moreover, the genes (such as Bcl2, Ucp2 and iNOS) relating to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen reactive free radical production were also influenced by some EDCs and their mixture. We suggest that heavy oxidative stress and the balance of nitric oxide (NO) production lead to death of immune cells. These results may provide an explanation of the possible mode how EDCs influence the innate immune system in zebrafish. Taken together, the results obtained in the present study clearly demonstrate that EDCs and their mixtures in aquatic systems will greatly influence the immune system in fish, suggesting that the effects of EDCs on fish should be associated with immune toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Results FFA release from adipocytes treated with epinephrine was markedly inhibited by BFOV and vanadyl sulfate, with the IC 50 values of 0.30 ±0.20 and 0.46 ± 0.26 mmol/l, respectively, but not by insulin. Whereas, the inhibition of vanadyl compounds on FFA release triggered by forskolin in adipocytes were not observed. BFOV dose-dependently reduced serum triglycerides and FFA concentrations when compared with untreated diabetic rats ( P < 0.05), while it did not influence cholesterol concentrations, similar to vanadyl sulfate. Serum leptin concentration was also decreased both in the BFOV- and vanadyl sulfate-treated diabetic group ( P < 0.05). Moreover, BFOV markedly reduced blood glucose concentration and food intake ( P < 0.05), but it did not change the body weight of diabetic rats. Conclusion BFOV has an antilipolytic action in adipocytes mediated by catecholamines. This action was distinct from that of insulin and also not related to inhibiting the activity of adenylate cyclase. In vivo, BFOV could improve dyslipidemia and leptin sensitivity in fat-fed/STZ-diabetic rats. Keywords Bis(α-furancarboxylato)oxovanadium(IV) Fat-fed/streptozotocin rats Lipid Adipocyte Lipolysis 1 Introduction It is well known that the complications of atherosclerotic macrovascular disease account for the majority of deaths and a disproportionate amount of morbidity in patients with diabetes. The increased concentrations of lipids pose the diabetic patients with a greater risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease. Inadequate utilization of glucose in diabetic models or in diabetic patients stimulates the mobilization of storage lipids, increasing triglycerides and FFA [1] . Increased plasma concentrations of FFA are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [2,3] by inhibiting glucose uptake and utilization by muscle [4] and causing increased glucose output by liver [5] . These disorders of fat metabolism, therefore, contribute to promote and maintain the alterations of glucose homeostasis [6] . Vanadium, an essential nutritional element in higher animals, has also been proposed as an in vivo regulator of cell metabolism. Vanadium compounds have been known to possess insulinmimetic and/or enhancing effects both in vitro and in vivo via a postreceptor mechanism. Vanadate inhibits phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) activity and increases tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin substrate proteins [7–9] . Various vanadyl complexes with different ligands have been synthesized and their antidiabetic effects have been reported. An important advancement in the use of vanadium compounds as insulin mimics has been the development of various ligands in order to reduce the toxicity and improve the absorption, tissue uptake and efficiency of vanadium. One example is bis(α-furancarboxylato)oxovanadium(IV) (BFOV, Fig. 1 ) in which the vanadyl ions are held in a bidentate-chelating framework that imparts thermodynamic stability and lipophicity to the compounds. With the hypoglycemic potency of the vanadium complex in type 1 and type 2 diabetic animals [10–13] , we evaluated the hypolipidemic efficacy of the complex, in order to elaborate BFOV as a potent oral anti-diabetogenic drug. Hence the present paper reports the effect of BFOV in ameliorating dyslipidemia in fat-fed STZ-induced diabetic rats, a model of type 2-like diabetic rats, and its antilipolytic action in isolated rat adipocytes, by using several agonists relevant to stimulating FFA release. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Reagents BFOV (purity > 98.5% by HPLC) was synthesized according to the method described previously [12] . Vanadyl sulfate (VOSO 4 ) was the product of Acros Origanics. STZ, collagenase (Type II), (6)-epinephrine hydrochloride (epinephrine) and forskolin were purchased from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin (BSA; fraction V) was the product of Roche. The biochemical kits used in this experiment were purchased from Shanghai Rongsheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, and China Institute of Atomic Energy. All other reagents were of analytical grade commercially available. 2.2 Animals Male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighing 130–180 g and 210–220 g, were obtained from Experimental Animal Center, Kunming Medical College. The animals were housed on a constant 12-h light/12-dark cycle in our temperature-controlled central animal facility (18–22 °C) and allowed free access to solid food and tap water. All procedures were in accordance with the Institute Ethical Committee for Experimental Use of Animals. 2.3 Preparation of isolated rat adipocytes Rat adipocytes were isolated by a modification of Rodbell's procedure [14] . Briefly, epididymal fat pads, excised from male Sprague–Dawley rats (weighing 130–180 g) anesthetized with ether, were cut into the appropriate pieces and were incubated with type II collagenase in Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) buffer (120 mmol/l NaCl, 1.27 mmol/l CaCl 2 , 1.2 mmol/l MgSO 4 , 4.75 mmol/l KCl, 1.2 mmol/l KH 2 PO 4 and 24 mmol/l NaHCO 3 : pH 7.4) containing 2% BSA at 37 °C with gentle shaking at 70 cycles/min for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, the prepared cells were filtered through nylon gauze and washed three times with KRB buffer without collagenase. The cells were counted in a hemacytometer and were prepared for 2.5 × 10 6  cell/ml. Cell preparations showed > 95% viability by trypan blue exclusion. 2.4 FFA release in isolated rat adipocytes Isolated rat adipocytes cells (2.5 × 10 6 cells/ml) were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with various concentrations of vanadyl compounds (0.2–2 mmol/l) or insulin (10–160 nmol/l) in KRB buffer containing 5.0 mmol/l glucose. Epinephrine (10 μmol/l) or forskolin (25 μmol/l) was then added to the reaction mixtures, and the resulting solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The reactions were stopped by soaking the tube in ice water, and the resulting mixtures were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. For the outer solution of cells, FFA concentrations were determined with a FFA kit. 2.5 Experimental induction of diabetes in rats The model of type 2-like diabetes was prepared as previously described [13] . Briefly, rats with weighing 210–220 g were intragastrically fed either vehicle (10% Tween-80 and 10% propylene glycol) or high-fat emulsion consisting of 15% lard, 30% sucrose, 10% Tween-80 and 10% propylene glycol in a volume of 20 ml/kg body weight once a day at 15:00, for 4 weeks. After an overnight fast, animals were injected intraperitoneally with STZ (25 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.1 mol/l citrate buffer (pH 4.4) or citrate buffer. Before injection and on 7th day after injection, blood samples were obtained from the tail vein for assay of blood glucose by the glucose oxidase method using commercially available kits. The fat-fed/STZ-rats with blood glucose concentrations > 11.1 mmol/l were chosen for experiment. 2.6 Experimental procedure Rats were divided into 6 groups of 10 rats according to the blood glucose concentration: Group 1, normal control rats (0.9% saline-treated); Group 2, fat-fed/STZ-diabetic rats (0.9% saline-treated); Group 3–5, fat-fed/STZ-rats treated with BFOV at a dose of 0.02, 0.06, 0.2 mmol/kg, respectively; Group 6, fat-fed/STZ-rats treated with 0.06 mmol/kg vanadyl sulfate. All the substances above were administered intragastrically twice a day at 9:00 and 16:00, for 4 weeks. During experimental period, blood glucose concentrations, body weight gain and food intake were monitored weekly. At the end of experiment, the rats were deprived of food overnight, and blood samples were collected from the femoral artery of rats for determination of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, FFA and leptin concentrations using commercially available kits. 2.7 Statistical analyses Data are expressed as means ± standard error (S.E.). Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's and Bonfferoni's multiple comparison tests using Prism ver. 4.0 software. Statistical significance was accepted at the concentration of P < 0.05. 3 Results The inhibitory activities of vanadyl complexes on FFA release from isolated rat adipocytes treated with epinephrine are shown in Fig. 2 . FFA release from isolated rat adipocytes was significantly stimulated by epinephrine, compared with control group that was cell only ( P < 0.05). Both BFOV and vanadyl sulfate markedly inhibited FFA release from isolated rat adipocytes treated with epinephrine in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC 50 value was found to be 0.30 ± 0.20 and 0.46 ± 0.26 mmol/l, respectively. But insulin did not antagonize lipolysis triggered by epinephrine. As shown in Fig. 3 , FFA release from adipocytes was significantly stimulated by forskolin, compared with control group ( P < 0.05). While neither BFOV nor vanadyl sulfate suppressed FFA release triggered by forskolin from isolated rat adipocytes. The changes in the concentration of serum lipids of different experimental groups are illustrated in Table 1 , from which it can be seen that the fat-fed/STZ-induced diabetic rats exhibited a significant increase of triglyceride and FFA concentrations. The administration of BFOV to diabetic rats for 4 weeks resulted in the decrease of triglyceride and FFA concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, when compared to untreated diabetic rats ( P < 0.05). No significant alterations were observed in serum cholesterol of experimental rats. The changes in the serum leptin, food intake, body weight and fasting blood glucose concentrations of the control and experimental rats were represented in Fig. 4 . There was a significant increase of the blood glucose, serum leptin, and food consumption, as well as a decrease of the body weight gain in fat-fed/STZ-diabetic rats. After treatment for 4 weeks with BFOV the hyperleptinemia, hyperglycemia and the intake of food in diabetic rats were markedly attenuated, while no changes in the body weight gain were observed in comparison with the diabetic rats. Different with BFOV, vanadyl sulfate did not reduce the blood glucose concentration and food intake of diabetic rats. 4 Discussion Prospective epidemiological studies show that an increased FFA concentration is a risk marker for long-term development of glucose intolerance and progression to type 2 diabetes. The increase in plasma FFA concentrations is the result of increased mobilization from adipose tissue. Thus, it is becoming increasingly apparent that reducing FFA release is an important goal in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. In the present investigation, the antilipolytic action of BFOV was observed by the inhibition of FFA release from isolated rat adipocytes treated with epinephrine and forskolin. When epinephrine binds to the β-adrenoceptor of adipocytes, the adenylate cyclase is activated to transform ATP to cyclic adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn activates some protein kinases and lipases. The activated lipase then hydrolyzes triglycerides to FFA, which will be released from the cells ( Fig. 5 ) [15] . When vanadate compounds were added to the system, the concentration of FFA was significantly decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, exhibiting that both vanadyl ion (vanadyle sulfate) and vanadyl complex (BFOV) inhibited FFA release from rat adipocytes treated with epinephrine. Interestingly, in the system, insulin did not antagonize epinephrine triggered lipolysis, which was consistent with the results reported by Li [16] . The findings suggested that BFOV has inhibitory effect of lipolysis mediated by superphysiological concentration of catecholamines, and the mechanism is different from that of insulin. As shown in Fig. 5 , insulin binds to the α-subunit of the insulin receptor and catalyzes autophosphorylation, which in turn stimulates tyrosine kinase in the β-subunit of insulin receptor. The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase then phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrate (IRS). Following these reactions, signal information is conveyed to downstream locations such as PI3-K, and GLUT-4 is then translocated to the surface of the cell membrane. Consequently, glucose uptake is enhanced and FFA release is subsequently inhibited in isolated rat adipocytes [17,18] by phosphorylating (on serine-302) and activating the phosphodiesterase type 3B (PDE3B), leading to a decrease in cAMP concentrations and thereby the inactivation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) [19] . To confirm whether antilipolysis by vanadyl compounds was related to adenylate cyclase, forskolin, an agonist of adenylate cyclase, was taken to disposal adipocytes instead of epinephrine. Forskolin produces a rapid increase in cAMP production through a direct activation, which in turn stimulates FFA release [20] . When vanadyl sulfate or BFOV was added, the inhibitory effect on FFA release induced by forskolin was not observed. It was suggested that the antilipolysis of BFOV was performed not by inhibiting the activity of adenylate cyclase in isolated rat adipocytes. The antilipolytic action seemed to be related to the signal transmission from the β-adrenoceptor to adenylate cyclase, which needs further identification. The rodent model induced by high-fat chow feeding plus a relatively moderate amount of STZ injection, which simulates the natural history and the metabolic characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes, has been recognized as type 2 diabetes model [21,22] . In a previous experiment, we reported that BFOV significantly improved the postprandial blood glucose, the glucose intolerance and the hyperinsulinemia, and increased insulin sensitivity index in the fat-fed/STZ-diabetic rats [13] . In the current experiment, administration of BFOV dose-dependently lowered the serum triglyceride and FFA concentrations in the fat-fed/STZ-diabetic rats. This further indicated that BFOV could decrease FFA release in vivo. It is believed that the decreased FFA flux to the liver prevents FFA uptake by the liver and thus reduces very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) hyperproduction in the liver, which will decrease the plasma triglyceride observed under treatment with BFOV. Further research needs to be done for more evidence. Recent advances in molecular and cell biology have shown that the adipose tissue not only stores excess energy in the form of fat but also secretes biologically active substances called adipocytokines, such as FFA, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), resistin and adiponectin [23] . Leptin, which is primarily synthesized and secreted from the adipose tissue, is a hormonal protein that controls the overall energy homeostasis via induction of reduced food intake and promotion of fat loss [24] . This adipocytokine has been shown to strongly relate to the developing type 2 diabetes [24] . In human type 2 diabetes, the circulating concentrations of leptin are usually increased accompanied by a reduction in leptin sensitivity (leptin resistance) [25] . Hyperleptinemia was observed in fat-fed/STZ-induced diabetic rats in our experiment, suggesting a state of ‘leptin resistance’. BFOV reduced the high serum leptin concentration in the diabetic rats, indicating the enhancement of leptin sensitivity. The improved leptin sensitivity suppressed the excessive food intake without affecting the body weight change. The leptin signal is thought to be predominately transferred by the stimulation of Jannus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signal transduction cascade via the binding of leptin to a receptor [26] . The transient characteristic of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 suggests that PTPs are involved in the negative regulation of this signaling pathway. Therefore, it has been suggested that PTP1B might be a key regulator of not only insulin signalling but also leptin signalling [27] . Vanadium compounds have been considered to enhance insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by inhibiting the PTP1B activity in type 2 diabetic animals [28] . It is worth further studying whether BFOV increases leptin sensitivity by affecting leptin signaling as a PTP1B inhibitor. In conclusion, BFOV complex optimized glucose utilization and reduced mobilization of fat depots, and in turn decreased hyperlipidemia. The antilipolytic action of BFOV was distinct from that of insulin, and was also not related to inhibiting the activity of adenylate cyclase.

        "abstract": "Plant growth and development are strongly affected by environmental pollutants, such as herbicides. Widely used herbicides can remain in soil or aquatic systems for long periods of time. Herbicide pollutants have been reported to heavily affect global plant growth and pose a significant challenge to agriculture. However, it is unclear whether herbicides affect plant flowering. Here, we demonstrated that imazethapyr (IM), a chiral herbicide, can enantioselectively promote flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. We clarified the possible mechanism by which IM promotes flowering and found that the photoperiod pathway may play an important role in propagating the IM stress signal. IM enantiomers decreased the amplitude of core oscillators (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL) and utilized the up-regulation of the GIGANTEA-(CONSTANS)-FLOWERING LOCUS T pathway to induce floral gene, APETALA1 over-expression enantioselectively; this treatment ultimately caused early flowering. Our findings provide new insight into the method by which plants control reproductive timing in response to herbicide stress. Flowering time is an important trait in crops and affects the life cycles of pollinator species. The persistence of herbicides in the biosphere will alter plant life cycles and diversity.",

        "abstract": "Water blooms caused by cyanobacteria are currently major global environmental issues. The outbreaks induced by nutrient elements have attracted much attention; however, the effects of environmental pollutants on the cyanobacteria are themselves poorly understood, especially those due to chiral chemicals. To explore the enantioselective eco-effects of the chiral herbicide diclofop-methyl (DM) and its major metabolite diclofop acid (DA), the physiological characteristics of Microcystis aeruginosa were investigated. The results showed that using both biomass and protein content as growth parameters is necessary to access the impact of the herbicides, that stimulation biomass production by R-DA and S-DA was apparent (nonessential), and that the concentration of 5 mg/L is worth noting. Ultrastructure changes in gas vacuoles, thylakoids, glycogen, cyanophycin granules, poly beta-hydroxybutyrate, polyhedral body, and lipids indicated different toxicity modes among the four chemicals. The different effects between R-DA and S-DA demonstrated that R-DA probably acts as a proton ionophore shuttling protons across the plasmalemma, whereas S-DA did not demonstrate such action. The toxicity order in the present study is S-DA < R-DA < DM < DA. Stimulation of the growth of M. aeruginosa during the first 3 days by herbicidally inactive S-DA was greater than that due to R-DA, which is adverse to water quality in water bodies. Therefore, using the herbicidally active R-enantiomer is recommended. These results are helpful in understanding the enantioselective effects of chiral pesticides on cyanobacteria, which is important for environmental assessment and protection. It is also helpful for guiding the application of chiral pesticides in agricultural settings.",

        "abstract": "Although an acceleration of male pubertal development has been observed, precisely which endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) might contribute to the advancing onset of puberty in boys remains unclear. Here, pyrethroids, a class of widely used insecticides that have been considered as EDCs, are proposed as new environmental risk factors. In this study, 463 boys at the age of 9-16 years old were recruited in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. The common metabolites of pyrethroids, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), and 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid (4-F-3-PBA), as well as gonadotropins, including luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), were analyzed in urine samples. Pubertal development was assessed based on Tanner stages and testicular volume (TV). A positive association between 3-PBA and gonadotropins was found (p < 0.001), in which a 10% increase in 3-PBA was associated with a 2.4% and 2.9% increase in LH and FSH, respectively. Higher urinary levels of 3-PBA in boys were associated with 275% and 280% increase in the risk of being genitalia stage 3 (G3) and G4, respectively (p < 0.05). There was a significant (132%) induction in odd of being TV 12-19 mL with increasing 3-PBA concentration compared to being in TV < 4 mL (p < 0.05). For the first time to our knowledge, this work reports on an association of increased pyrethroid exposure with elevated gonadotropins levels and earlier pubertal development in boys.",

Many investigations of both astrophysical\n observation and nucleosynthesis calculation have been carried out to solve the puzzle, but it is not solved yet. Several nuclear\n reactions involving lithium have been indirectly measured at China Institute of Atomic Energy, Beijing. The Standard BBN (SBBN)\n network calculations are then performed to investigate the primordial Lithium abundance. The result shows that these nuclear\n reactions have minimal effect on the SBBN abundances of 6Li and 7Li.",

Generally, the enzyme activities in rhizosphere soil were higher than those in non-rhizosphere soil. After 45 days of metolachlor treatment, the numbers of bacteria and fungi in rhizosphere soil were higher than those in non-rhizosphere soil, and the R/S was 1.76 to approximately 2. 51. The numbers of actinomycetes were relatively stable, and the rhizosphere effect was not significant. The degradation rate of metolachlor in rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soil was 0. 0217 and 0.0176, and the corresponding half-live was 31.9 and 39.4 days, respectively. The degradation of metolachlor was enhanced greatly in rhizosphere soil.",

        "abstract": "The wide usage of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) as pesticides has caused soil pollution and adverse health effects through direct contact or bioaccumulation in the food chain. This study quantified major HCH isomers in farmland topsoils across China, and evaluated their correlations with microbial community structure, function, and abiotic variables (e.g., moisture, pH, and temperature). Recalcitrant β-HCH was more abundant than α-, γ-, and δ-HCHs, and α-HCH enantiomeric fractions (EF) were larger than 0.5, indicating preferential degradation of (-)-α-HCH. Sphingomonas was not only a predominant population (especially in samples collected in the south), but also a promising biomarker indicating total- and β-HCH residuals, and EF values of α-HCH. Soil moisture and temperature were among the most influential factors that structured the diversity and function of soil microbial communities. The results suggested that increasing soil moisture (in the range of 5-45%) would benefit the growth of HCH-degrading populations and the enrichment of HCH-degradation related pathways. Revealing the site-specific relationships between topsoil physical, chemical, and microbial properties will benefit the in situ bioremediation of farmlands with relatively low HCH residuals across the world.",

The radius of plastic zone is decreased along with the increase of the intermediate principal stress parameter b. An example is analyzed and contrasted with and without considering seepage. The radius of plastic zone with considering influence of seepage is larger than that without considering the seepage influence. The results also indicate that the parameter b and seepage have significant influences on tangential stress and radial stress. The results obtained by the original linear expression and the nonlinear improved expression of the two-parameter twin shear unified strength theory are large difference.

        "abstract": "Pyrethroids, the widely used pesticides, are highly toxic to aquatic organisms. However, little information is so far available regarding the joint toxicity of type I and type II pyrethroids to fish. Zebrafish is a well-accepted aquatic vertebrate model for toxicity assessment due to small size, easy husbandry, high fecundity and transparent embryos. In this study, we utilized embryo-larval zebrafish to elucidate the combined effects of sublethal concentrations of permethrin (PM) and cypermethrin (CP), which are the most frequently used type I and type II pyrethroids, respectively. Fish were exposed from 3h postfertilization (hpf) to 144 hpf to binary mixtures of nominal concentrations of 100, 200, 300μgL(-1) PM (PM100, PM200, PM300) and 10, 20, 30μgL(-1) CP (CP10, CP20, CP30). Analytical data of the real concentrations of the chemicals showed a significant degradation of the pyrethroids but an obvious recovery after the renewal of the exposure solution. Defect rates of embryos exposed to these low concentrations of single PM or CP exhibited no statistically significant difference from the control,while the application of combination of PM and CP resulted in deleterious effects on zebrafish embryonic development. In all PM200 and PM300 exposure groups, increasing CP concentrations acted additively to the action of PM in terms of all sublethal endpoints. Co-treatment of embryos with the specific sodium channel blocker MS-222 and pyrethroids (individuals or the mixture) caused a decline in the incidences of body axis curvature and spasms compared to treatment of animals with pyrethroids alone, suggesting that the developmental toxicity of PM and CP to zebrafish was related to disruption of ion channels. We further revealed that mixture of the two pyrethroids caused greater down-regulation in the mRNA levels of proneural genes. The individual pesticides had no effect on the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), while the mixture exposure caused significant induction. Treatment with CP or the mixture increased the activity of catalase (CAT). Taken together, our data indicated that the mixture of PM and CP caused higher incidence of morphological defects, greater inhibition in proneural gene expression and more oxidative stress, compared to the single chemical at the corresponding doses. Our findings suggest that the combination of type I and type II pyrethroids poses a greater risk to fish in the water column.",

        "abstract": "Objective: The relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) respond less well to chemotherapy and generally poor outcome. This phase I study evaluate safety and efficacy of a humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (anti-CD52 mAb) in the treatment of patients with CLL and PTCLs. Methods: According to WHO standards, 30 consecutive patients (6 patients with CLL and 24 patients with PTCLs) entered the study from November 2007 to June 2010. Anti-CD52 mAb was diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% normal saline and administered by intravenous infusion. Anti-CD52 mAb is divided into three dose groups, a single 3 mg group of 10 cases, a single 10 mg group of 12 cases, and the 30 mg group of 8 cases. The usage of 30 mg group is as follows, The first dose was 3 mg on day 1, which was increased to 10 mg on day 3 and then to 30 mg on day 5 as soon as infusion-related reactions were tolerated. The 30-mg dose was subsequently administered 3 times a week for up to 7 weeks. The 30 mg group is the same as foreign literature and medicine instructions. The Clinical data of the patients were analyzed by statistic software package of SPSS 16.0. Results: There were 17 males and 13 females, the median age was 47 (21~69 years) in the cohort. All patients were relapsed or refractory cases. Of the 30 patients, 26 (86.7%) developed adverse reactions. There were 59 adverse events in 26 patients. The most frequent side effects were Hematologic toxicity, grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 6 of 59 (10.2%), but no severe thrombocytopenia. One presented a grade 3 liver enzyme elevation. Infectious complications were by far the most frequent nonhematologic toxicities. Grade 3/4 infection were in 7 of 59 (11.9%), including Cytomegalovirus infection in 4 of 59 and Bacterial infectious complication in 3 of 59. The Bacterial infectious complications were treated successfully with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. The overall response rate of anti-CD52 mAb was 46.7% (14/30) with 6.7% (2/30) complete remission rate (CR) and 40.0% (12/30) partial remission rate (PR). Conclusion: Anti-CD52 mAb is a practicable and effective regimen for patients with CLL and PTCL.",

Treatment included 6-8 cycles of CHOP-L (cyclophosphamide, 750 mg/m(2) day 1; vincristine, 1.4 mg/m(2) day 1 (maximal dose 2 mg), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) day 1; dexamethasone 10 mg days 1-8; L-asparaginase 6000 u/m(2) days 2-8). Radiotherapy was scheduled after 4-6 cycles of CHOP-L regimen, depending on stage and primary anatomic site. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) rate.A total of 38 eligible patients were enrolled. The median age was 40.5 years (range, 15 to 71 years). Their clinical characteristics were male to female ratio, 24:14; Ann Arbor stage I, 20; II, 11; III, 3; IV, 4. CR and overall response rates were 81.6% (95% CI, 69.3% to 93.9%) and 84.2%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 25 months, the 2-year overall survival, progression-free survival and disease-free survival rates were 80.1% (95%CI, 73.3% to 86.9%), 81% (95%CI, 74.5% to 87.5%) and 93.6% (95%CI, 89.3% to 97.9%), respectively. The major adverse events were myelosuppression, liver dysfunction, and digestive tract toxicities. Grade 3 to 4 leukopenia and neutropenia were 76.3% and 84.2%, respectively. No treatment-related death was observed.CHOP-L chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy is a safe and highly effective treatment for newly diagnosed ENKTL.",

The confidence interval of filter paper toxicity test was the widest and therefore the method was not so reliable. The acute toxicity of Rac- metolachlor and S-isomer on earthworms in the natural soil test was larger than that in the artificial soil test. According to the classification criteria of the toxic chemicals, Rac-metolachlor and S-isomer should belonged to the low poisonous pesticides. There were little differences in LC50 of Rac-metolachlor and S-isomer on earthworms, which showed that the chiral difference of the two pesticides on the acute toxicity of earthworms was insignificant.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hepatotoxicity of heptaplatin and LLC-0601 in SD rats, and to explore the toxic mechanisms. METHODS: Rats were respectively injected with cisplatin 2 mg·kg -1 (positive control), heptaplatin 40 mg·kg -1 and LLC-0601 40 and 70 mg·kg -1, once a day, for 2 d, and then an inteval for 5 d, all 3 courses for 6 injections, and then rats restored for 28 d. After the last 24 h after administration and after restoration 28 d, the rats were inspected for their general condition. Serum biochemistry indices glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB) and total bilirubin (T-Bil) were detected. Liver mass and coefficients were detected. The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) was examined and liver histopathology was observed. RESULTS: Compared with normal control group, rats in treated groups except LLC-0601 70 mg·kg -1 appeared to be dispirited, and mat, food intake decreased, significant vertical hair phenomena, with a reduction of activity. GPT was higher, but TP and ALB were lower in heptaplatin group (P < 0.05). Compared with normal control group, liver mass and organ coefficients, GSH-Px and T-SOD were lower in the drug-treated groups (P < 0.05). While MDA was significantly higher (P < 0.05). Liver tissue in cisplatin, heptapletin and LLC-0601 70 mg·kg -1 groups showed focal necrosis and sinusoidal lymphocytic infiltration of liver cells. After 28 d restoration all indices returned to normal except cisplatin group. CONCLUSION: Heptaplatin and LLC-0601 can induce liver damage and the mechanism may be related to their oxidative damage.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the metabolic mechanisms is critical and remains a difficult task in risk assessment of emerging pollutants. Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), one of the widely-used aryl phosphorus flame retardants (aryl-PFRs), has been frequently detected in the environment, whose major metabolite was deemed as diphenyl phosphate (DPHP). However, knowledge of the mechanism for TPHP leading to DPHP and other metabolites is lacking. Our in vitro study shows TPHP is metabolized into its diester metabolite DPHP, and mono-, di-hydroxylated metabolites by cytochromes P450 (CYP) in human liver microsomes, while CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 isoforms are mainly involved in such process. Molecular docking gives the conformation for TPHP binding with the active species Compound I (an iron IV-oxo heme cation radical) in specific CYP isoforms, showing the aromatic ring of TPHP is likely to undergo metabolism. Quantum chemical calculations have shown the dominant reaction channel is O-addition of Compound I onto the aromatic ring of TPHP, followed by hydrogen-shuttle mechanism leading to ortho-hydroxy-TPHP as the main mono-hydroxylated metabolite; the subsequent H-abstraction/OH-rebound reaction acting on ortho-hydroxy-TPHP yields the meta- and ipso-position quinol intermediates, while the former of which can be metabolized into di-hydroxy-TPHP by fast protonation, and the latter species needs to go through type I ipso-substitution and fast protonation to be evolved into DPHP. We envision the identified mechanisms may give inspiration for studying the metabolism of several other aryl-PFRs by CYP.",

        "abstract": "Bisphenol S (4-hydroxyphenyl sulfone, BPS) is increasingly used as BPA alternatives. The global usage of BPS and its analogues (BPSs) caused the frequent detection of their residues in multiple environmental media. We investigated their potential endocrine disrupting effects toward thyroid hormone receptor (TR) β. The molecular interaction of BPSs toward TRβ ligand binding domain (LBD) was probed by fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. BPSs caused the static fluorescence quenching of TRβ LBD. The 100 ns MD simulations revealed that the binding of BPSs caused significant changes of the distance between residue His435 at helix 11(H11) and residue Phe459 at H12 in comparison with no ligand-bound TRβ LBD, indicating relative repositioning of H12. The recombinant two-hybrid yeast assay showed that tetrabromobisphenol S (TBBPS) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) have potent antagonistic activity toward TRβ with IC10 of 10.1 nM, 21.1 nM, respectively. BPS and BPA have the antagonistic activity with IC10 of 312 nM, 884 nM, respectively. BPSs significantly altered the expression level of mRNA of TRβ gene in zebrafish embryos. BPS and TBBPS at environmentally relevant concentrations have antagonistic activity toward TRβ, implying that BPSs are not safe BPA alternatives in many of the BPA-free products. Future health risk assessment of TR disruption and other adverse effects should focus more on the structure-activity relationship in designing environmentally benign BPA alternatives.",

        "abstract": "Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) were widely used as additive brominated flame retardants. Their hydroxylated products (OH-PBBs) have been detected frequently in various marine mammals, causing an increased health risk. Till now, there lacks information on the potential disruption of OH-PBBs toward thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and the molecular characteristics of their interactions remain largely unknown. We herein in vitro and in silico evaluated the disrupting effect of 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromobiphenyl (BB80) and its metabolite 2,2'-dihydroxy- 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromobiphenyl (OH-BB80) toward human TR. The recombinant human TRβ two-hybrid yeast assay reveals the moderate antagonistic activity of OH-BB80 with IC at 2 μmol/L, while BB80 shows no agonistic or antagonistic activity. OH-BB80 binds at the binding cavity of TRβ ligand binding domain (LBD) and forms one hydrogen bond with Phe272. Electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions contribute much to their interactions. The binding of OH-BB80 quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of TRβ LBD at static quenching mode. Our study extends knowledge on the endocrine disrupting effect of OH-PBBs and suggests the full consideration of the biotransformation for further health risk assessment of PBBs and related structurally similar emerging contaminants.",

        "title": "How were the heavy chemical elements beyond iron made in the Universe",
        "abstract": "Nuclear astrophysics, which is an interdisciplinary branch of nuclear physics (micro scale) and astrophysics (macro scale), addresses some of the most compelling questions in the universe. Research efforts have been devoted to many topics such as the origins of the chemical elements, the unique conditions of earth that makes life possible, and the formation and evolution of the sun, stars, and galaxies. Nuclear processes play an extremely important role in cosmic evolution after the Big Bang, and they are the only known mechanisms that synthesize heavy elements, in addition to providing the energy for stars to resist the force of gravity.   Over the past  50 years,  scientists have developed a deep understanding of Big-Bang primordial nucleosynthesis and the mechanisms for synthesizing heavy elements. However, the astrophysical models have yet to adequately reproduce the observed solar abundances of those elements beyond iron (referred to as ultra-iron elements). It is widely believed that these ultra-iron elements were primarily synthesized via the slow neutron capture process (s-process) and the fast neutron capture process (r-process). The fundamental s-process component is thought to originate from thermally pulsing low-mass AGB stars, with reaction pathways closed after the stable nuclides. About half of the heavy elements (up to bismuth) were produced via the s-process. The r-process is thought to occur in the explosive burning of core-collapse supernova and/or neutron-star mergers. Although the r-process site remains a mystery, experts believe that more than half of the ultra-iron elements (up to thorium and uranium) were produced via the r-process. In addition, there are 35 neutron-deficient stable isotopes, which are present in significantly less abundance in our solar system. These so-called p-nuclei are likely produced in Type II supernova, through the photo-dissociation (referred to as p-process or r-process) of existing s- or r-process seeds, or through the recently proposed neutrino-proton  v p-process.  Astrophysical models require a huge amount of nuclear-physics input data. The most essential data include nuclear mass, structure, decay and fission characteristics, and related nuclide cross-sections along the various nucleosynthesis paths. Thus far, the lack of systematic and precise nuclear inputs is one of the main reasons scientists have not been able to reproduce the observed solar abundances of ultra-iron elements. Published by  Discover  magazine in 2002, the American National Research Council ranked the question, how were the heavy elements from iron to uranium made? as one of  the 11 Greatest Unanswered Questions of Physics in this Century . More complete and precise nuclear physics inputs are therefore urgently needed to improve astrophysical models and decode the observations.  This paper introduces the most important nucleosynthesis processes that are responsible for the ultra-iron elements production in the universe, while also summarizing the relevant key nuclear-physics inputs required in the astrophysical models. Finally, the frontier in this field study includes the origins of ultra-iron elements, and the future of nuclear astrophysics research in China is examined.",

        "abstract": "Efficient cycling of Fe3+/Fe2+ is a key step for the Fenton reaction. In this exploration, from microalgae, we have prepared a novel Fe-N-graphene wrapped Al2O3/pentlandite composite which showed high Fenton catalytic ability through accelerating of Fe3+ reduction. The catalyst exhibits high activity, good reusability along with stability, and wide adaptation for the organics degradation under neutral pH. High TON and H2O2 utilization efficiency have also reached by this catalyst. Characterization results disclose a unique structure that the layered Fe-N-graphene structure tightly covers on Al2O3/pentlandite particles. Mechanistic evidences suggest that the accelerated Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycle originates from the enhanced electron transfer by the synergistic effect of Fe, Ni and Al in the catalyst, and it causes the low H2O2 consumption and high •OH generation rate. Moreover, organic radicals formed in the Fenton process also participate in the Fe3+ reduction, and this process may be accelerated by the N doped graphene through a quick electron transfer. These findings stimulate an approach with great potential to further extend the synthetic power and versatility of Fenton catalysis through N doped graphene in catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Greater exposure to herbicide increases the likelihood of harmful effects in humans and the environment. Glufosinate, a non-selective herbicide, inhibits glutamine synthetase (GS) and thus blocks ammonium assimilation in plants. In the present study, the aquatic unicellular alga Chlorella vulgaris was chosen to assess the effects of acute glufosinate toxicity. We observed physiological changes during 12-96 h of exposure, and gene transcription during 6-48 h of exposure. Exposure to glufosinate increased malondialdehyde content by up to 2.73 times compared with the control, suggesting that there was some oxidative damage. Electron microscopy also showed that there were some chloroplast abnormalities in response to glufosinate. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) also increased markedly in the presence of glufosinate. Maximum activities of SOD, POD, and CAT were 2.90, 2.91, and 2.48 times that of the control, respectively. These elevated activities may help alleviate oxidative damage. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay showed changes in transcript abundances of three photosynthetic genes, psaB, psbC, and rbcL. The results showed that glufosinate reduced the transcript abundances of the three genes after 12h exposure. The lowest abundances of psaB, psbC and rbcL transcripts in response to glufosinate exposure were 38%, 16% and 43% of those of the control, respectively. Our results demonstrate that glufosinate affects the activities of antioxidant enzymes, disrupts chloroplast ultrastructure, and reduces transcription of photosynthesis-related genes in C. vulgaris.",

        "abstract": "A novel nicotine-degrading Pseudomonas sp. strain, HZN6, was isolated from a pesticide-wastewater treatment facility in Hangzhou. The strain could grow on nicotine\n as its sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. The strain’s main intermediate metabolites were determined to be pseudooxynicotine,\n 3-succinoyl-pyridine (SP), and 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine (HSP). A Tn5 transposon mutant was generated in which the degradation\n pathway was blocked at the SP. A 4,583-bp DNA fragment flanking the transposon insertion site was obtained through self-formed\n adaptor PCR and analyzed. The mutant gene orfC displays 89% deduced amino acid sequence identity with the sirA-like gene (sirA2, a sulfurtransferase homologue gene) of Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501. The orfC-disrupted strain lost the ability to degrade SP, and the complementation strains with the orfC from the Pseudomonas sp. HZN6 and the sirA2 (PP_1233) from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 recovered the degradation ability. Though the orfC-disrupted strain also lost the xanthine dehydrogenase activity, the effects of tungsten on the degradation of SP and hypoxanthine\n revealed that the hydroxylation of SP to HSP was not a xanthine dehydrogenase type. These results demonstrated that the orfC gene was essential for the SP metabolism involved in the nicotine metabolic pathway in the Pseudomonas sp. HZN6 strain. This study might advance the understanding of the nicotine metabolic mechanism in Pseudomonas.",

        "abstract": "Arsenic (As) in the environment is of concern due to its strong toxicity and high risks to the ecosystems and humans. In this study, soil samples across China collected in 2011 and 2016 were used to determine the concentrations of arsenic in arable soils. The median concentration of arsenic in surface soils was 9.7mg/kg. The inventory of arsenic in the Chinese agricultural surface soils was estimated to be 3.7×10tons. In general, arsenic contamination was found higher in South and Northeast China than in other regions, with means of 18.7 and 15.8mg/kg, respectively. Vertically, arsenic concentrations were higher in top layer (0-15cm) soils (median of 9.8mg/kg) and decreased with soil depth (medians of 8.9mg/kg at 15-30cm and 8.0mg/kg at 30-45cm). By comparing with published data, an increasing accumulation trend over the past decades was found and this enhancement was positively related with the long-term application of fertilizers in agricultural practice, especially phosphate fertilizers. Soil pH was found to affect the movement of arsenic in soil, and high-pH conditions enhanced the pool of arsenic. The ecological risk assessment revealed that arsenic in Chinese agricultural soil posed a low risk to the ecosystem. Regarding human health, the mean hazard indices (HIs) of arsenic were below 1, suggesting an absence of non-carcinogenic risks. In addition, the cancer risks of arsenic in all soil samples were within the acceptable range (below 1×10), indicating low to very low risks to the exposed population. Findings from this study are valuable to provide effective management options for risk avoidance and to control the persistent accumulation of arsenic in the agriculture sector across the world.",

        "abstract": "Even though the application of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) has been restricted for over 30 years, their ubiquitous existence still poses profound adverse impacts on ecosystem and human health. In this study, simultaneous soil and air sampling campaigns at different functional areas were conducted in warm and cold seasons. Based on the residue levels and enantiomeric signatures of DDT and its metabolites in soils and air, the parameters influencing ecological and human health risks were explored. ΣDDT concentrations in soils correlated positively with organic matter (OM) and negatively with pH, whereas atmospheric DDT levels were primarily facilitated by increased temperature. High temperature and low soil pH were also favorable for the transformation of DDT into its metabolites. The inhabitants living in agricultural regions or in areas with higher soil OM or pH < 7 were exposed to higher existing and potential health risks of soil DDTs. In addition, at lower temperatures, the existing and potential carcinogenic risks of DDTs from soil exposure were higher, whereas risks from air inhalation were lower. Health risks would be increased when considering the enantioselective toxicity of o,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDD. The results from this study could provide baseline support for risk control and avoidance of DDTs.",

        "abstract": "The residues and enantiomeric fractions of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured in 11 mollusk species collected from the coastal areas along the Yangtze River Delta to evaluate the status, potential sources, and health risks of pollution in these areas. The concentrations of DDTs, HCHs, and chlordanes ranged from 6.22 to 398.19, 0.66-7.11, and 0.14-4.08 ng g(-1) based on wet weight, respectively; DDTs and HCHs have the highest values, globally. The DDTs increased and the HCHs decreased compared to historical data. Both the box-and-whisker plots and the one-way ANOVA tests indicated that the OCP levels varied little between sampling locations and organism species. The compositions of the DDTs and HCHs suggested a cocktail input pattern of fresh and weathered technical products. The comparative EF values for the α-HCH between the sediments and mollusks, as well as the lack of any discernible difference in the relative proportions of HCH isomers among different species from the same sampling site implied that the HCH residues in the mollusks came directly from the surrounding environment. However, the biotransformation of DDTs in mollusks cannot be precluded. The assessments performed based on several available guidelines suggested that although no significant human health risks were associated with the dietary intake of OCPs, the concentrations of DDTs exceeded the maximum residual limits of China and many developed nations. Moreover, an increased lifetime cancer risk from dietary exposure to either DDTs or HCHs remains a possibility. Because non-racemic OCP residues are common in the mollusk samples, our results suggest a need to further explore the levels and toxicity of the chiral contaminants in mollusks and other foodstuff to develop the human risk assessment framework based on chiral signatures.",

        "abstract": "It is significant to study the variations in the stability coefficients of hydrodynamic pressure landslides with different permeability coefficients affected by reservoir water level fluctuations and rainstorms. The Sifangbei landslide in Three Gorges Reservoir area is used as case study. Its stability coefficients are simulated based on saturated-unsaturated seepage theory and finite element analysis. The operating conditions of stability coefficients calculation are reservoir water level variations between 175 m and 145 m, different rates of reservoir water level fluctuations, and a three-day continuous rainstorm. Results show that the stability coefficient of the hydrodynamic pressure landslide decreases with the drawdown of the reservoir water level, and a rapid drawdown rate leads to a small stability coefficient when the permeability coefficient ranges from 1.16 × 10−6 m/s to 4.64 × 10−5 m/s. Additionally, the landslide stability coefficient increases as the reservoir water level increases, and a rapid increase in the water level leads to a high stability coefficient when the permeability coefficient ranges from 1.16 × 10−6 m/s to 4.64 × 10−5 m/s. The landslide stability coefficient initially decreases and then increases as the reservoir water level declines when the permeability coefficient is greater than 4.64 × 10−5 m/s. Moreover, for structures with the same landslide, the landslide stability coefficient is most sensitive to the change in the rate of reservoir water level drawdown when the permeability coefficient increases from 1.16 × 10−6 m/s to 1.16 × 10−4 m/s. Additionally, the rate of decrease in the stability coefficient increases as the permeability coefficient increases. Finally, the three-day rainstorm leads to a significant reduction in landslide stability, and the rate of decrease in the stability coefficient initially increases and then decreases as the permeability coefficient increases.",

        "abstract": "Dechloranes, including Mirex, Dechlorane 602 (Dec 602), Dechlorane 603 (Dec 603), Dechlorane 604 (Dec 604) and Dechlorane Plus (DP), are a class of chlorinated flame retardants. To investigate the effect of urbanization and tide on the distribution of Dechloranes in sediment, we assayed surficial sediments collected from the Qiantang River in eastern China for the presence of these chemicals. The concentrations of Mirex, Dec 602, Dec 603, and DP ranged from below detection limit (BLD) to 0.68 ng/g dry weight (dw), BLD-0.048 ng/g dw, BLD-0.026 ng/g dw, and BLD-1.1 ng/g dw, respectively. Dechloranes 604 was not detected in any sediment samples. It was evident that local urban and industrial activities were the primary source of DP in surficial sediments in the Qiantang River, which was supported by the fact that the average DP concentration of sediment samples in urban sites was approximately three-fold higher than that in rural sites. An extremely high concentration of DP at a reservoir site in a rural area indicated that a dam can block the movement of DP in the Qiantang River by slowing down the river current and making the reservoir the primary sink of DP. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of Dechloranes suggested that concentrations of Dechloranes in sediment in the tide zone were much lower than those in the non-tidal zone, indicating that tide played an important role in transportation and re-distribution of Dechloranes in sediments of the Qiantang River.",

Careful analysis of the secondary beam components and extensive Monte-Carlo simulations enable the resolution of the experimental proton spectra. The resonance parameters for five low-lying levels in 14O were deduced by R-matrix fitting calculations with MULTI7 and SAMMY-M6-BETA. The present results show general agreement with those from a recent similar work, and thus confirm the observation of a new 0- level at 5.7 MeV in 14O with an improved width of 400(45) keV.",

X-ray structural analysis revealed that this isomerism originates from two opposite spatial orientations of the hydroxyl group on the cyclobutane ring in relation to the coordinated NH3, resulting in cis- and trans-configurations. The two isomers have approximately equal anticancer activity, probably due to a relatively long distance between the hydroxyl group and the Pt(II) coordination plane. Therefore, the separation of such isomers is not recommended during drug development.",

Lipolysis was assayed by free fatty acids (FFA) released from isolated rat adipocytes treated with epinephrine. The results showed that BFOV, similar to insulin, concentration-dependently significantly enhanced the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]-glucose and the transformation from D-[ 3H]-glucose to lipid in isolated rat adipocytes, with the EC 50 values of (0.31 ± 0.08) mmol·L-1 and (0.49 ± 0.12) mmol·L-1, respectively. Moreover, BFOV markedly inhibited FFA release from isolated rat adipocytes treated with epinephrine, and the IC50 value was (0.30 ± 0.20) mmol·L-1. BFOV had insulino-mimetic effects such as enhancing glucose uptake and lipogenesis, as well as inhibiting lipolysis.",

At the present time, these compounds are found in almost all environmental and human samples. In order to evaluate the environmental safety and health risk of HBCDs, the enantiomerically pure alpha-, beta-, and gamma-HBCD were prepared using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a PM-beta-CD column and the cytotoxicities of their enantiomers were evaluated in Hep G2 cells. Results from the 3-(4,5-dimethylthioazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), resazurin reduction and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays showed a good agreement that the order of cytotoxicity was gamma-HBCDbeta-HBCD>alpha-HBCD, and that significantly lower cell viability and higher LDH release were observed in all (+)-enantiomers ((+) alpha-, (+) beta- and (+) gamma-HBCD) than the corresponding (-)-forms ((-) alpha-, (-) beta- and (-) gamma-HBCD). Additionally, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by these HBCD enantiomers were detected. The positive correlation between the LDH release and ROS formation demonstrated that the toxic mechanism might be mediated by oxidative damage. These results suggest that environmental and human health risks of HBCDs must be evaluated at the level of individual enantiomers.",

        "abstract": "Interactions between heavy metals and organic contaminants can result in speciation changes of heavy metals. Therefore, it is unknown whether organic contaminants in aquatic environments act as selective agents to mediate the toxicity of heavy metals. To elucidate these interactions, the effects of the herbicide imazethapyr (IM) on Cu(II) ecotoxicity to the aquatic unicellular alga Scenedesmus obliquus were investigated. It was found that the toxicity of Cu could be mediated by IM. To explore the mechanisms involved, complex formation, the catalytic activity of the complex, the Cu species and the distribution of Cu and Fe in the algal cell were characterized. The results showed that Cu(II) and IM formed an octahedral complex with an IM:Cu molar ratio of 2:1. These complexes also catalyzed the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide. Analysis of the K-edge of Cu using XAFS spectroscopy indicated that when treated with Cu, the Cu was bound to polygalacturonic acid (on the cell wall), and once inside the cell, Cu may complex with the reduced glutathione (GSH) (in the cell). When the cell is treated with IM and Cu simultaneously, IM-Cu may be the primary complex formed. Once Cu combines with IM, it is difficult for it to interact with the cell wall. In addition, using scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy, it was found that Cu could induce changes in the distribution of the essential trace element Fe, whereas IM-Cu cannot. This finding demonstrates the importance of interactions between heavy metals and organic contaminants, which are able to mediate the toxicity of heavy metals and should be considered in future risk assessments.",

The Effects of the derivatives on the blood glucose concentrations were investigated in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. Results During the experiment, bis(a-tetrahydrofurancarboxylato)oxovanadium(IV) (VO-HFA) reduced the blood glucose in alloxan- diabetic mice, but was less active than the parent compound VO-FA. Bis(5-bromo-a-furancarboxylato)oxovanadium(IV) (VO-FABr) had no hypoglycemic effect. Both derivatives were more toxic than VO-FA.

        "abstract": "Risk assessment of man-made chemicals such as pesticides are mainly focused on parent compounds, and relatively little is known about their metabolites, especially with regard to target organ damages such as immunotoxicity. In the present study, the immunotoxicity of five synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) and three common metabolites was evaluated using an in vitro model by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cytoflow, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell viability and apoptosis assays showed that both SPs and their metabolites possessed cytotoxicity to the monocytic cells. The aldehyde and acid derivatives were more effective than the other compounds at cytotoxicity, with inhibition of cell viability by 56.8 and 50.6% at 10⁻⁵ mol L⁻¹, and induction of 8.52 and 8.81% cell apoptosis, respectively. Exposure to SPs and their metabolites also led to changes in the secretion levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF α) and interleukins (ILs), and again the metabolites showed stronger effects than the parent compounds. The aldehyde derivative upregulated IL-12p70 level by 1.87-fold, and the alcohol and acid derivative increased the secretion of TNF α 5.88 and 7.96-fold, relative to the control group. In the in vitro model, the common metabolites of SPs clearly exerted greater immunotoxic effects to monocytes than the intact parent compounds. Results from the present study suggested the need for considering metabolites in achieving more comprehensive health risk assessment of man-made chemicals, including target organ toxicities such as immunotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Bis(alpha-furancarboxylato)oxovanadium(IV) (BFOV) is a new orally active anti-diabetic organic vanadium complex. In the previous studies, we found that BFOV exhibited a glucose-lowering activity following oral administration to type 1-like diabetic mice induced by alloxan and rats induced by streptozotocin, and the mechanism was not related to enhancing the insulin synthesis and secretion. Since the enhancement of insulin sensitivity is involved in one of the mechanisms by which vanadium exerts its anti-diabetic effects, BFOV has been further tested on fat-fed/streptozotocin-treated rats, a type 2-like diabetic animal model, in the present study. The results showed that 4 weeks of BFOV treatment significantly improved hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia, as well as increased insulin sensitivity index in the fat-fed/streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Furthermore, BFOV efficiently activated glucokinase, increased hepatic glycogen content and suppressed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression in the liver and kidney of the diabetic rats, which contributed to augmentation of hepatic glucose disposal and maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis. These findings suggested that BEOV had anti-diabetic and insulin-sensitizing effects in the diabetic rats, exhibiting the potential to be developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Nicotine is an important environmental toxicant in tobacco waste. Shinella sp. strain HZN7 can metabolize nicotine into nontoxic compounds via variations of the pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways. However, the catabolic mechanism of this variant pathway at the gene or enzyme level is still unknown. In this study, two 6-hydroxynicotine degradation-deficient mutants, N7-M9 and N7-W3, were generated by transposon mutagenesis. The corresponding mutant genes, designated nctB and tnp2, were cloned and analyzed. The nctB gene encodes a novel flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing (S)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase that converts (S)-6-hydroxynicotine into 6-hydroxy-N-methylmyosmine and then spontaneously hydrolyzes into 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine. The deletion and complementation of the nctB gene showed that this enzyme is essential for nicotine or (S)-6-hydroxynicotine degradation. Purified NctB could also convert (S)-nicotine into N-methylmyosmine, which spontaneously hydrolyzed into pseudooxynicotine. The kinetic constants of NctB toward (S)-6-hydroxynicotine (Km = 0.019 mM, kcat = 7.3 s(-1)) and nicotine (Km = 2.03 mM, kcat = 0.396 s(-1)) indicated that (S)-6-hydroxynicotine is the preferred substrate in vivo. NctB showed no activities toward the R enantiomer of nicotine or 6-hydroxynicotine. Strain HZN7 could degrade (R)-nicotine into (R)-6-hydroxynicotine without any further degradation. The tnp2 gene from mutant N7-W3 encodes a putative transposase, and its deletion did not abolish the nicotine degradation activity. This study advances the understanding of the microbial diversity of nicotine biodegradation.",

Exposure to 0.5 and 1.5 microM Cu or 1.0 and 2.0 microM Cd alone significantly decreased algal growth and chlorophyll content and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) content. Two-way ANOVA analysis shows that the combination of these two metal compounds decreased cell growth, chlorophyll content and increased ROS content synergistically. The highest algal cell inhibition was 78.55%, the lowest levels of chl a, chl b and total-chl were 10.59%, 33.33% and 17.94% of the control, respectively. The highest increase in ROS was 9.15-fold greater than that of the control when exposed to Cu(1.5)+Cd(2.0). Real-time PCR shows that Cu and Cd reduced the transcript abundance of psbA and rbcL, but without a synergistic interaction, whereas Cu and Cd increased the transcript abundance of psaB synergistically. These results demonstrate that Cu and Cd independently inhibit PSII activity and CO(2) assimilation, but synergistically increase ROS content to disrupt chlorophyll synthesis and inhibit cell growth.",

In this work we investigated the concentration levels of endosulfans and chlordane, which are currently used, and the never used aldrin and dieldrin in the province of Zhejiang, a rainy, and hilly tea-growing province in eastern China. The average/mean residue levels of OCPs was in the order ∑endosulfan > ∑chlordane > aldrin > dieldrin. The residue level was in good agreement with the usage of OCPs in Zhejiang. The spatial distribution showed that the residues of OCPs in soils from the mountain area were always higher than those in soils from the plains. The distribution characteristics were related to usage for current-use OCPs and temperature for never used OCPs. The isomeric ratios and enantiomeric fractions are useful tools to identify the degradation preference of contaminants. The wide range of ratios between trans-chlordane (TC) and cis-chlordane (CC) indicated that the degradation of the two isomers of chlordane was different at different sites. Nonracemic residues of TC and CC were observed in most soils; this is significant since the enantiomers have different toxicities.",

The effect of ethanol on kinetics of acid phosphatase was determined by using the double reciprocal plot. The results indicate the ethanol has a significant effect on the activity and conformation of acid phosphatase. The activity of acid phosphatase decreased linearly with increasing the concentration of ethanol. Differential UV-absorption spectra of the enzyme denatured in ethanol solutions showed two positive peaks at 213 and 234 nm, respectively. The peaks on the differential UV-absorption spectra suggested that the conformation of enzyme molecule changed from orderly structure to out-of-order crispation. The fluorescence emission peak intensity of the enzyme gradually strengthened with increasing ethanol concentration, which is in concordance with the conformational change of the microenvironments of tyrosine and tryptophan residues. The results indicate that the expression of the enzyme activity correlates with the stability and integrity of the enzyme conformation to a great degree. Ethanol is uncompetitive inhibitor of acid phosphatase.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with primary systemic ALCL (anaplastic large cell lymphoma), and to explore the role of ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and other prognostic factors in primary systemic ALCL. Methods: Clinical data and follow-up information of 45 primary systemic ALCL patients treated in Peking University Cancer Hosipital from December 2002 to September 2011 were reviewed. Results: Among the 45 patients with primary systemic ALCL, 34 (75.6%) were ALK-positive, and 11 (24.4%) were ALK-negative. The only different clinical characteristic with statistical significance in these patients between ALK (+) and ALK (-) was age, with a younger median age of 23.5 years for ALK (+) compared with 49.0 years for ALK (-) (P = 0.022). Median follow-up period was 32 months. Of 45 patients, the 5-year estimated survival rate was 71.9%. The 5-year estimated survival rates were 71% and 72% in patients with ALK (+) and ALK (-), respectively (P = 0.581). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that only short-term response was associated with survival rate (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Primary systemic ALCL usually occurs in young patients, with a good prognosis. ALK expression alone is not sufficient to determine the outcome of ALCL. This study suggests that short-term response is an independent prognostic factor. Copyright © 2013 by TUMOR.",

Methods: Retrospective analysis was conducted in 69 cases of PGDLBCL between January 2007 and December 2009.The data of clinical presentations, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis were collected, and the association of clinicopathological features with treatment outcomes and prognosis was analyzed. Results: PGDLBCL comprised about 10.44% (69/661) of all lymphomas, including 29 males and 40 females; the median age was 54 years old (range: 21-78). The major clinical presentations of PGDLBCL were abdominal pain, abdominal distension and melena. ALL patients were treated with chemotherapy-based comprehensive treatment. In this cohort, the complete remission rate was 37.7% (26/69), the partial remission rate was 46.4% (32/69), and the overall response rate was 81.4% (58/69). The univariate analysis revealed that the patients with increased level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) had poor response (P<0.05). The one-, two- and three-year survival rates were 89.2%, 84.2% and 81.3%%, respectively. The univariate analysis revealed that the age, international prognostic index (IPI) and serum LDH had significant effects on the prognosis; COX regression multivariate analysis showed that only serum LDH had significant effect on the prognosis. Conclusion: PGDLBCL is more common in female and treated mainly with chemotherapy-based comprehensive treatment. The prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation should be emphasized. Serum LDH was an important prognostic factor for PGDLBCL. Copyright© 2011 by TUMOR.",

        "abstract": "Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) with different usage states, such as currently, historically or never used, may show different behaviors and potential risks in the environment. It is essential to identify their distribution patterns and fates and to assess their associated health risks to humans. In this study, based on a nationwide sampling campaign across China, we determined the concentrations of currently (endosulfan), historically (chlordane and heptachlor) and never-used (aldrin, dieldrin and endrin) OCPs in agricultural soils. The total residue inventories of ∑Endosulfans, ∑Chlordanes, heptachlor and ∑Drins in soils were 260, 64.3, 54.2 and 88.6 t, respectively. The residues of endosulfan were influenced by current usage, showing a latitude transect trend. Drins were mainly from long-range transport, but the illegal usage in China still affected their residues. This finding indicates that endosulfan and drins in Chinese agricultural soils mainly follow the primary and secondary distribution pattern, respectively. Both primary and secondary distribution have a great impact on the distribution pattern of chlordane, which had been banned for only 4 years at the time we sampled. The health risks of these OCPs were estimated based on their concentrations. There were 0.813% and 1.63% of samples that exceeded the target values for chlordane and endrin according to the Netherlands guideline for unpolluted soil. Their residues in most of the samples posed no or few non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to human beings. The results from this study will provide powerful support for pollution control and management.",

        "abstract": "The squares of the neutron asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) for the virtual decay 12B →11B + n are extracted to be 1.20 ± 0.26, 0.354 ± 0.107 and 1.98 ± 0.35 fm-1 from the angular distributions of the 11B(d, p)12B reaction leading to the ground, first and second excited states of 12B respectively, using the Johnson-Soper approach. According to charge symmetry of strong interaction, the square of proton ANC of virtual decay 12N →11C + p is determined to be 1.63 ± 0.35 fm-1 and then utilized to calculate the astrophysical S-factor and the rate of the direct capture contribution in the 11C(p, γ)12N reaction. The astrophysical S-factor at zero energy for the direct capture, S(0), is derived to be 0.088 ± 0.019 keV b. An evaluated S(0) of 0.092 ± 0.009 keV b is then given by using the present and pre-existing experimental results. In addition, the proton widths of the first and second excited states of 12N are derived to be 0.91 ± 0.29 and 99 ± 20 keV from the neutron ANCs of 12B and used to compute the contribution from the first two resonances of 12N, respectively. We have also calculated the contribution from the interference effect between the direct capture and the second resonance. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Herbicides present in the environment induce oxidative stress in plants. We investigated the roles of exogenous NO-regulated chlorophyll synthesis, antioxidant enzyme activity and gene expression in herbicide-treated unicellular green algae Chlorella vulgaris. Atrazine (100 microg/L) or glufosinate (10 mg/L) treatment alone or in combination with 20 microM sodium nitroprussiate (SNP, 10 microM with glufosinate) was administered to algae for a short time period of 48 h to observe changes in physiology and gene transcription and expression. Supplementation of atrazine or glufosinate with low SNP significantly reduced H2O2, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) induction by herbicides. Supplementation also increased chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity, as compared to herbicide treatment alone. This trend suggests an effect of NO on the scavenging of ROS. Furthermore, the expression of photosynthesis genes (psbC, psaB, chlB and rbcL) was also upregulated by supplementation of low SNP, thus maintaining the normal photosynthetic function. However, high concentration of SNP (100 microM) in combination with herbicides aggravated damage to algae, including increases in H2O2, ROS and MDA and decreases in chlorophyll content, antioxidant enzyme activity and photosynthesis genes transcription. 2-Phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO), the NO scavenger, was also examined in this study; the results showed that PTIO could neutralise the effect of low SNP. Data also showed that an exogenous supply of NO protects Chlorella vulgaris against the toxicity of herbicides by protecting against oxidant substances and increasing the transcription of related genes.",

        "abstract": "A novel method was developed to simultaneously separate and determine the enantiomers of rac- diclofop methyl and rac-diclofop acid using chiral high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with fluorescence detection. Parameters affecting the chiral separation such as the added amounts of isopropanol and acetic acid in the mobile phase, and column temperature were studied. A simultaneous baseline separation of the enantiomers was obtained with a mobile phase of n-hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid ( 90∶10∶0.2 , V/V) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min under 20℃. The proposed method was applied to determine the enantiomers of rac-diclofop methyl and rac-diclofop acid in water. The recoveries of all enantiomers were higher than 85% with relative standard deviations less than 5.0%.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to enhance the activity and stability of the chemi-deposited palladium/nickel foam (Pd/Ni foam) electrode used in the electrochemical dechlorination process. The electrochemical deposition of silver onto a nickel foam substrate (Ag/Ni foam) was applied before the chemical deposition of palladium. The physicochemical properties of the resultant material (Pd/Ag/Ni foam) were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the silver coating was in the form of spherical apophyses, and the palladium was dispersed finely on the surface of the Ag/Ni foam. Dichloroacetic acid was selected as an indicator to evaluate the activity and stability of the palladium catalyst. Pd/Ag/Ni foam electrode consistently had relatively higher dechlorination rate and current efficiency (CE) in the current density range of 1.5–10.5 mA cm −2 compared to the Pd/Ni foam electrode. Quantitative analysis of the main intermediates and final products involving monochloroacetic acid, acetic acid and the chloride ion further demonstrated the enhancement of electrochemical dechlorination by the presence of silver. Moreover, after five cycles of dechlorination, the CE for the Pd/Ni foam electrode decreased dramatically from 67% to 13%, whereas that for the Pd/Ag/Ni foam electrode was decreased by much less, from 78% to 62%, and the palladium loss was clearly reduced by the addition of a silver coating between the Ni foam and the Pd outer layer.

However, comparison of their clinical outcomes has never been reported. This study investigated their efficacy and adverse events in B-NHL therapy. Six patients with r/r B-NHL were initially enrolled and infused with 28z or BBz CAR-T cells at a dose of 0.75-5 × 10/kg. These CAR-T cells showed similar antitumor efficacies, with a complete response (CR) rate of 67% within 3 months. BBz CAR-T was well tolerated. However, severe cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in the 28z CAR-T cohort, resulting in the termination of further evaluation of 28z CAR-T. Three more patients were enrolled to investigate BBz CAR-T cells in-depth at an escalated dose (1 × 10/kg). All cases achieved CR within 3 months, and only grade 1/2 adverse events occurred. This study suggests that 4-1BB is more beneficial for the clinical performance of CAR-T cells than CD28 in CD19-targeted B-NHL therapy, at least under our manufacturing process.",

        "abstract": "The 7Be(p, γ)8B reaction plays a central role not only in the evaluation of solar neutrino fluxes but also in the evolution of the first stars. Study of this reaction requires the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) for the virtual decay 8B g.s. → 7Be + p. By using the charge symmetry relation, we obtain this proton ANC with the single neutron ANC of 8Li g.s. →7Li + n, which is determined with the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) and adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) analysis of the 7Li(d, p)8Li angular distribution. The astrophysical S-factors and reaction rates of the direct capture process in the 7Be(p, γ)8B reaction are further deduced at energies of astrophysical relevance. The astrophysical S-factor at zero energy for direct capture, S 17(0), is derived to be (19.9 ± 3.5) eV b in good agreement with the most recent recommended value. The contributions of the 1+ and 3+ resonances to the S-factor and reaction rate are also evaluated. The present result demonstrates that the direct capture dominates the 7Be(p, γ)8B reaction in the whole temperature range. This work provides an independent examination to the current results of the 7Be(p, γ)8B reaction.",

        "abstract": "The ecotoxicology effects of chiral herbicides have long been recognized and have drawn increasing attention. The toxic mechanisms of herbicides in plants are involved in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause damage to target enzymes, but the relationship between these two factors in the enantioselectivity of chiral herbicides has rarely been investigated. Furthermore, even though cytochromes P450 enzymes (CYP450s) have been related to the phytotoxicity of herbicides, their roles in the enantioselectivity of chiral herbicides have yet to be explored. To solve this puzzle, the CYP450s suicide inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) was added to an exposure system made from dichlorprop (DCPP) enantiomers in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The results indicated that different phytotoxicities of DCPP enantiomers by causing oxidative stress and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) damage were observed in the presence and the absence of ABT. The addition of ABT decreased the toxicity of (R)-DCPP but was not significantly affected that of (S)-DCPP, resulting in smaller differences between enantiomers. Furthermore, profound differences were also observed in Fe uptake and distribution, exhibiting different distribution patterns in A. thaliana leaves exposed to DCPP and ABT, which helped bridge the relationship between ROS production and target enzyme ACCase damage through the function of CYP450s. These results offer an opportunity for a more-comprehensive understanding of chiral herbicide action mechanism and provide basic evidence for risk assessments of chiral herbicides in the environment.",

In order to characterize the congener-specific compositions of PCBs in the soil-air process and assess the associated human health risks, soil and air samples were simultaneously collected in winter and summer at two different functional locations. Homologue patterns suggest that long-range atmospheric transport might be the major source of soil and air residues of PCBs. The net deposition from air to soil was overwhelming for most PCB congeners. Variations in the occurrence and the homologue patterns of PCBs between the soil and air interface depended on chemical volatility, soil organic matter (OM) content, ambient temperature, topographical condition and atmospheric transport. Dioxin-like PCBs accounted for 11.0-70.3% and 2.31-54.8% of total PCB residues in soil and air, respectively. Non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks associated with exposure to soil and air PCBs were also estimated. Different PCB congeners showed different health effects, with the highest contribution from PCB-26. Additionally, the non-carcinogenic risk levels of PCBs were enhanced, while the carcinogenic risk levels decreased during the soil-air exchange process of PCBs with time. Our results highlight the soil-air interaction of PCBs in predicting their potential human exposure health risks.",

This study provides the first data on distribution of PAEs in the sediments in the Qiantang River, Zhejiang Province, China, and the inference with urbanization and river flow regime. PAEs were detected in all 23 sediment samples analyzed, and the total concentrations of their 16 congeners in sediments ranged from 0.59 to 6.74μg/g dry weight (dw), with the geometric mean value of 2.03μg/g dw. Of the 16 PAE congeners, di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were present in all sediment samples. The PAEs concentrations in urban regions were higher than those in rural regions because of higher discharge of PAEs from plastic materials in urbanized areas. Concentrations of PAEs were positively correlated with sediment organic matter (fOM) and negatively correlated with logistic value of annual average flow volume at sample sites. River flow regime modified by man-made dams significantly affected the distribution of PAEs. Analysis of congener composition of PAEs indicated that the DEHP was predominant congener in the Qiantang River. The normalized concentration of DEHP exceeded recommended environmental risk limit (ERL).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Air pollution has recently become China’s highest environmental issue due to the rapid development of industry and urbanization. So far, the precise sources of air pollution of main cities are unknown. To identify sources, we studied air pollution in the Hangzhou city from November 25 to December 11, 2013, at eight monitoring stations. We analyzed PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, CO, SO2, and satellite observations for aerosol optical thickness (PM: particulate matter). Pollution sources were identified by trajectory clustering and receptor models. The results show that during the weekly heavy haze episode, December 3–9, mean concentrations were 293.4 ± 103.2 μg m−3 for PM2.5, 376.8 ± 119.4 μg m−3 for PM10, 58.0 ± 37.2 μg m−3 for SO2, 118.5 ± 39.3 μg m−3 for NO2, and 2,429 ± 740 μg m−3 for CO. The back trajectory cluster analysis indicates that the predominant clusters are south (37.1 %) and southeast (28.6 %) during the weekly heavy haze episode. The results of the receptor models show that the sources affecting formation of the extremely high PM2.5 in Hangzhou are mainly located in the southeastern coast of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, north part of Jiangxi, and central part of Jiangsu province. Rather than local emissions, it is also found that air mass pathways and cross-border transports control high PM2.5 concentrations and formation in Hangzhou. Therefore, it is necessary to implement air pollution control for all industrial areas at local, regional, and national scales in China.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fludarabine-based combination chemotherapy in 20 patients undergoing initial treatment for marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZL). Methods: Data of 20 patients with initial treatment of MZL in the study hospital between September 2005 and February 2010, including 16 with extranodal MZL, 3 with nodal MZL and 1 with splenic MZL, were reviewed in this study. A fludarabine-based regimen was administered in all patients. Specifically, 14 patients were treated with a FC regimen (Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) while 6 were treated with R-FC (Rituximab + FC). On average the patients received 4.3 (1-6) therapeutic cycles. Results: Eighteen of the 20 patients (90 %) achieved complete remission (CR) and the other 2 patients (10 %) achieved partial remission (PR). The total effective rate (CR + PR) was 100 % (20/20). In all 20 patients, the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 88 %, the progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 88 % and the disease-free survival rate was 85 %. Myelosuppression and mild GI toxicity were the major side effects. The rates of leucopenia, nausea and vomiting and mild liver injury were 51 % (III+IV 9.3 %), 20%, and 8%, respectively. Six patients (30 %) had thrombocytopenia; the incidence of thrombocytopenia was 66.7% (4/6) in patients over 60 years old and 14.3% (2/14) in patients younger than 60 years old (P = 0.037). Pulmonary fungal infection occurred in 1 patient (5 %). Conclusion: The fludarabine-based chemotherapy regimen has shown a satisfactory therapeutic effect on patients undergoing initial treatment for MZL, and the corresponding side effects can be well tolerated.",

        "abstract": "Cyclodextrins are common compounds capable of forming inclusion complexes with a variety of pesticides to improve their solubility, bioavailability, and stability. In this study, chloramidophos (CP) was inclusion-complexed with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) by a kneading method in an attempt to gain a more stable but equally effecacious formulation compared with CP alone. A 1:1 CP-beta-CD complex with an inclusion constant of 203.0 M(-1) was determined to exist by UV spectrophotometry. The structural identification, thermal stability, and biological assays of the CP-beta-CD complex were then carried out with a product with the maximum guest loading efficiency. The data measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), where the endothermic peaks of beta-CD, the FT-IR bands, and the XRD peaks were generally changed, deduced the formation of complex. Results of the thermal stability assay showed that the degradation rate of CP in 14-day incubation was slowed by a factor of 3.6 when it was complexed with beta-CD. Then, activity and toxicity of CP influenced by the encapsulated process of beta-CD were evaluated by an in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition assay and an acute aquatic toxicity assay, respectively. No significant differences were found in both the two biological assays by a t-test. This indicated that the encapsulation process greatly improved the thermal stability of the pesticide with no adverse effects on bioefficacy compared to that of CP. There is a promising outlook for CP-beta-CD to be produced as the active ingredient of various formulation additives of CP for its continued application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Chirality is a critical topic in the medicinal and agrochemical fields. One quarter of all agrochemicals was chiral in 1996, and this proportion has increased remarkably with the introduction of new compounds over time. Despite scientists have made great efforts to probe the enantiomeric selectivity of chiral chemicals in the environment since early 1990s, the different behaviours of individual enantiomers in biologically mediated processes are still unclear. In the present review, we highlight state-of-the-knowledge on the stereoselective biotransformation and accumulation of chiral contaminants in organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans. Chiral insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pharmaceuticals, flame retardants hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are all included in the target compounds. Key findings included: a) Changes in the enantiomeric fractions  in vitro  and  in vivo  models revealed that enantioselectivity commonly occurs in biotransformation and bioaccumulation. b) Emerging contaminants have become more important in the field of enantioselectivity together with their metabolites in biological transformation process. c) Chiral signatures have also been regarded as powerful tools for tracking pollution sources when the contribution of precursor is unknown. Future studies are needed in order to understand not only preliminary enrichment results but also detailed molecular mechanisms in diverse models to comprehensively understand the behaviours of chiral compounds.",

Their clinical data were analyzed by statistical software package SPSS 16.0.Accounting for around 4.7% of all lymphomas at our institution, the present cohort had 21 males and 10 females with a median age of 38 years old. The major clinical manifestations were focal neurological deficits associated with the site of disease or increased intracranial pressure. Most patients were treated with chemotherapy-based regimens. The overall response rate was 67.7% (21/31) with 32.3% (10/31) complete remission rate (CR) and 35.5% (11/31) partial remission rate (PR). Involvement outside CNS or bone marrow, high international prognostic index (IPI) and B symptoms had significant effects on the therapeutic efficacy (P < 0.05). The overall survival rates were 80.7%, 74.2%, 64.5% and 58.1% at 3, 6, 12, 24 months respectively. The median survival time was 22.5 months. Univariate analysis showed that the clinical efficacy had significant effects on the overall survival of patients (OR = 0.030, 95%CI: 0.003 - 0.270, P = 0.000).The prognosis of CNSL remains poor. New diagnostic tools and treatment modality need to be explored.",

The kernel function in model is replaced by exponential function, trigonometric function, negative exponential function and power function. Based on the elastic solution of shear stress on bolt surface of the wholly grouted anchor derived with Mindlin's solution of displacement, wholly grouted anchor is analyzed by the modified nonlocal friction models which have four different kernel functions. The shear stress distributions on bolt surface given by the modified nonlocal friction models and the local friction models are similar. The nonlocal friction effect is also discussed. The results obtained by the modified nonlocal friction model with different kernel functions and local friction model are compared with experimental results. It is found that the calculating results obtained by modified nonlocal friction model with the negative exponential kernel functions agree better with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Cyclodextrins (CDs), a class of cyclic oligosaccharide molecules containing a variety of chiral centre, are capable of recognizing enantiomeric molecules through the formation of inclusion complexes. In this work, we selected three types of CDs, beta-CD and its two derivatives, randomly methylated beta-CD (RAMEB) and hydroxypropyl beta-CD (HP-beta-CD), to evaluate effects on toxicity of racemic fenoxaprop (rac-FA) and its R-enantiomer (R-FA) to freshwater alga Scenedesmus obliquus (S. obliquus) and their dissipation in S. obliquus suspension with and without CDs addition, respectively, in an attempt to get more detail about enantioselective behavior of fenoxaprop acid (FA) in the environment, using CDs as a remediation agent for FA and formulation additive for fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (FE). The significant difference between rac-FA and R-FA was not observed in their acute toxicity to S. obliquus and dissipation in S. obliquus suspension. RAMEB had no effect on either toxicity of FA to S. obliquus or dissipation of FA in S. obliquus suspension, and it also didn't change the extent of enantioselectivity in toxicity of FA to S. obliquus. But the addition of a certain amount of beta -CD and HP-beta -CD reduced the toxicity of FA to S. obliquus and increased dissipation of FA in S. obliquus suspension, as well as changed the enantioselectivity in toxicity of FA to S. obliquus. The results indicated beta-CD and HP-beta-CD could be used as a promising agent for remediation of aquatic contamination produced by FA, and RAMEB might be used as potential formulation additives for FE, the parent compound of FA, as RAMEB didn't decrease activity of R-FA and might be environmentally safer than the conventional additives.",

        "abstract": "Acetofenate (AF) is a widely used insecticide in China and other regions of southeastern Asia. A previous study showed that AF caused adverse developmental effects in zebrafish. Macrophages, which play a key role in inflammation, host defense, and reactions against a spectrum of autologous and foreign invaders, are crucial for innate immunity. However, cytotoxicity and apoptosis of macrophages caused by organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have so far received little attention. In this study, we used AF as a model chemical to investigate the cytotoxic effects of OCPs on mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Results from cell viability and apoptosis assays showed that AF induced apparent apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, AF induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage and resulted in the alteration of a series of signaling molecules including up-regulation of p53 and cytochrome c protein levels, decline of the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, and activation of the caspases cascade through caspase-9 and caspase-3. These results, for the first time, revealed that the increase of endogenous ROS and DNA damage comediating OCP-induced apoptosis in macrophages may be by the mitochondria and p53 signal pathway. Our results suggested that macrophages are involved in AF-induced adverse immune effects. Considering the ubiquitous environmental presence of OCPs, this study provided new information on the potential long-term physiological and immunological effects due to chronic exposures to OCPs.",
