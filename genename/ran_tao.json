        "abstract": "The sampling rate conversion is always used in order to decrease computational amount and storage load in a system. The fractional\n Fourier transform (FRFT) is a powerful tool for the analysis of nonstationary signals, especially, chirp-like signal. Thus,\n it has become an active area in the signal processing community, with many applications of radar, communication, electronic\n warfare, and information security. Therefore, it is necessary for us to generalize the theorem for Fourier domain analysis\n of decimation and interpolation. Firstly, this paper defines the digital frequency in the fractional Fourier domain (FRFD)\n through the sampling theorems with FRFT. Secondly, FRFD analysis of decimation and interpolation is proposed in this paper\n with digital frequency in FRFD followed by the studies of interpolation filter and decimation filter in FRFD. Using these\n results, FRFD analysis of the sampling rate conversion by a rational factor is illustrated. The noble identities of decimation\n and interpolation in FRFD are then deduced using previous results and the fractional convolution theorem. The proposed theorems\n in this study are the bases for the generalizations of the multirate signal processing in FRFD, which can advance the filter\n banks theorems in FRFD. Finally, the theorems introduced in this paper are validated by simulations.",

This paper investigates multi-channel filter banks associated with the LCT. First, the perfect reconstruction (PR) conditions are analyzed and design method of PR filter banks for the LCT is proposed, which demonstrates that the LCT based filter banks can inherit conventional design methods of filter banks in the Fourier domain. Then polyphase decompositions in the LCT domain are defined and polyphase realization of the LCT based filter banks is derived in terms of polyphase matrices. Furthermore, multi-channel cyclic filter banks associated with the LCT are proposed by defining circular convolution in the LCT domain. The PR design method and polyphase representation of cyclic filter banks for the LCT are derived similarly. Finally, simulations validate the proposed design methods of the LCT based filter banks and also demonstrate potential application of the LCT based cyclic filter banks in image subband decomposition.",

However, contourlets produce undesirable artifacts while despeckling. This letter presents a novel contourlet-based regularization method to remove speckle without introducing extra artifacts. In this method, a nonlocal regression function is constructed for the regularization term through patch weighting on the contourlet reconstruction. Moreover, by employing the intrinsic dependence of contourlet coefficients, a parameterized shrinkage algorithm is proposed to resolve the contourlet reconstruction. This contourlet despeckling method enables significant elimination of speckle and resultant artifacts with well-protected strong scatters and structures of the scene.

This paper explores the relationship between sampling theorems and multirate filterbanks in the linear canonical transform (LCT) domain.

Furthermore, we relate the multichannel sampling for bandlimited signals in the LCT domain as well as the corresponding continuous-time LCT filterbank to the discrete-time LCT filterbank, which can lead to new sampling strategies for bandlimited signals in the LCT domain. \u00a9 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee Springer.",

We focus on the resolution performances of LFM signal in the fractional Fourier domain (FRFD) and the order of FRFT, and the influence of the order error of FRFT on output signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The relationships of signal duration and chirp rate with the FRFD resolution, with the order resolution and with the SNR loss are obtained respectively. In detection and parameter estimation of the LFM signal based on the FRFT, this research can provide some theoretical help for resolution analysis and the order step selection.",

The WVH transform can detect the existence of the chirp signal and estimate the parameters of the chirp signal, including the mean frequency and chirp rate. The validity of the WVH transform was verified by the simulated echo signal of moving targets with the synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Compared with conventional WVD-HT method, the WVH transform simplifies the processing procedure.",

Two self-organizing algorithms IUSOCPN and ISSOCPN, being unsupervised and supervised respectively, are introduced. The idea is to construct the neural-fuzzy system with a two-phase hybrid learning algorithm, which utilizes a CPN-based nearest-neighbor clustering scheme for both structure learning and initial parameters setting, and a gradient descent method with adaptive learning rate for fine tuning the parameters. The obtained network can be used in the same way as a CPN to model and control dynamic systems, while it has a faster learning speed than the original back-propagation algorithm. The comparative results on the examples suggest that the method is fairly efficient in terms of simple structure, fast learning speed, and relatively high modeling accuracy.",

Then, this paper illustrates that it is possible to design two-channel FIR Quadrature Mirror Filter Banks (QMFB) and Conjugate Quadrature Mirror Filter Banks (CQMFB) through the prototype filters of FIR QMFB and CQMFB in Fourier domain. The proposed theorems in this study advance the generalization of filter banks in FRFD, which are the bases of the applications of FRFT in the practices, such as image processing, speech signal processing, etc. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by the simulations.",

In this paper, we apply the perfect reconstruction transmultiplexer in the FRFD to develop the transform order division multiplexing (TODM), which transmits the original information in the multidirections in the time-frequency plane simultaneously. The proposed TODM systems can be divided into two types. One needs the multitransmission of the original information while the other needs the modifications of the original information by the interpolation and the inverse discrete FRFT. The performance analysis of the TODM systems is also presented, including the system capacity, the reconstruction accuracy, the security, and the limitation. Compared with the multiplexing in the FRFD, the TODM is more flexible and the security of the system is highly strengthened. Finally, simulation results confirm the obtained analytical results.",

The proposed metric-based autofocus algorithm is based on the Wiener deconvolution filter, which has the advantage of the phase error compensation as well as noise suppression.

To compare the performance of the metric-based SAR autofocus, we also present a detailed analysis of different sharpness metrics.

        "abstract": "Autofocus is very important to the imaging of air-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). There have been many kinds of the autofocus technique, which could fall into two categories according to whether the phase error is approximated with a parametric model or not. On the condition that prominent points exist in the image, the non-parametric methods have superiority over the parametric ones in dealing with high-order phase errors due to their high precision and appropriate computational complexity. As will be shown in this paper, the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) plays a pivotal roll in this kind of autofocus. The time-frequency filtering is introduced because of its extraordinary performance in raising the SCR of time-variant signals. Since the main part of the phase error is quadratic, the short-time fractional Fourier domain (STFRFD) filtering is utilized, and then a novel autofocus method termed time-frequency filtering-based autofocus (TFFA) is proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulations show the validity of this approach.",

In the proposed framework, the base layer is of low resolution and is generally encoded at low bit rates with traditional prediction based coding schemes. Two enhancement layers, i.e., the low-resolution enhancement layer and the high-resolution enhancement layer, are generated to improve the video quality of the low- resolution base layer and evolve smoothly from low resolution to high resolution video with increasingly better quality, respectively. Since bit plane coding and drifting control techniques are applied to the two enhancement layers, each enhancement bitstream is fine-grain scalable and can be arbitrarily truncated to fit in the available channel bandwidth. In order to improve the coding efficiency and reduce the drifting errors at the high-resolution enhancement layer, five macroblock coding modes with different forms of motion compensation and reconstruction, are proposed in this paper. Furthermore, a mode decision algorithm is developed to select the appropriate coding mode for each macroblock at the high-resolution enhancement layer. Compared with the traditional spatial scalable coding scheme, the proposed framework not only provides the spatial scalability but also provides the fine granularity quality scalability at the same resolution.",

Filtering in the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domain can deblur space variant degradation effectively, but hardly denoise substantially in the meantime. We propose a fractional Fourier-contourlet restoration algorithm to remove the space variant blur and the white Gaussian noise in images. The deblurring is realized by the fractional Fourier filtering while denoising through the coutourlet shrinkage. Our hybrid scheme is based on the MSE minimization principle. This scheme resolves the problem of contradiction between deblurring and denoising in a single transform domain. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can yield favorable performance to satisfy both sides of deblurring and denoising.",

Firstly, based on product theorem for the FRFT, the sampling theorems and reconstruction formulas are derived, which explain how to sample a continuous-time signal to obtain its discrete-time version for band limited signals in the fractional Fourier domain. Secondly, the formulas and significance of decimation and interpolation are studied in the fractional Fourier domain. Using the results, the sampling rate conversion theory for the FRFT with a rational fraction as conversion factor is deduced, which illustrates how to sample the discrete-time version without aliasing. The theorems proposed in this study are the generalizations of the conventional versions for the Fourier transform. Finally, the theory introduced in this paper is validated by simulations.",

The SPI method identifies the side peaks by their positions and amplitudes relative to the main peaks. The SPE-I method eliminates the intra-symbol side peaks and the inter-symbol side peaks by preprocessing the reference signal respectively, and obtains the main peaks from the intersection of the peak positions in the two cross-ambiguity function (CAF) diagrams. The SPI method can identify the side peaks without the power loss and may lose the main peaks masked by the side peaks. The SPE-I method can eliminate the side peaks and detect the main peaks masked by the side peaks at the expense of the power loss. Combination of the SPI method and the SPE-I method can overcome their disadvantages. The proposed methods can avoid the false alarms of the side peaks and improve the target detection performance.",

        "abstract": "It is a main form using the main beamwidth of the ambiguity function to judge the signal resolution, in which the range or\n Doppler resolution of the signals are investigated for the targets close to each other. However, for the pulse signal with\n rectangular envelope, if the nominal range resolution is calculated from the classic definition, there exists the problem\n of infinite integral for the high power terms of sine function, and a definite result could not be obtained. Though a definite\n solution of the nominal velocity resolution can be calculated from the definition, the calculation for the signal consisting\n of multiple-pulse, especially several periods, is very complex. The paper begins with the physical meaning of nominal resolution\n rather than from the definition formula to solve the problem using the ambiguity matrix, and make the calculation simplified\n greatly.",

In this paper, we propose a novel method to encrypt an image by multiorders of FRFT. In the image encryption, the encrypted image is obtained by the summation of different orders inverse discrete FRFT of the interpolated subimages. And the original image can be perfectly recovered using the linear system constructed by the fractional Fourier domain analysis of the interpolation. The proposed method can be applied to the double or more image encryptions. Applying the transform orders of the utilized FRFT as secret keys, the proposed method is with a larger key space than the existing security systems based on the FRFT. Additionally, the encryption scheme can be realized by the fast-Fourier-transform-based algorithm and the computation burden shows a linear increase with the extension of the key space. It is verified by the experimental results that the image decryption is highly sensitive to the deviations in the transform orders.",

This paper proposes two fast algorithms of cross-ambiguity function for passive radar: the multi-stage decimation FFT algorithm and the pre-weighting multi-stage decimation FFT algorithm. The multi-stage decimation FFT algorithm decreases the length of the antialiasing filters and save the computational amount and the storage. The pre-weighting multi-stage decimation FFT algorithm avoids the cycle of the first-stage filter multiplication in different time delays and further increases the computational efficiency at the expense of the large storage. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively increases the computational efficiency.",

The digital processing of the fringe pattern is widely used to enable automatic analysis and improve the accuracy and flexibility. Before digital processing, sampling and quantization are necessary, which introduce quantization errors in the fringe pattern. Quantization errors are always analyzed and suppressed in the Fourier transform (FT) domain. But Newton's rings fringe pattern is demonstrated to be a two-dimensional chirp signal, and the traditional methods based on theFT domain are not efficient when suppressing quantization errors in such signals with large bandwidth as chirp signals. This paper proposes a method for suppressing quantization errors in the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domain, for chirp signals occupies little bandwidth in the FRFT domain. This method has better effect on reduction of quantization errors in the fringe pattern than traditional methods. As an example, a standard Newton's rings fringe pattern is analyzed in the FRFT domain and then 8.5 dB of improvement in signal-to-quantization-noise ratio and about 1.4 bits of increase in accuracy are obtained compared to thecase of the FT domain. Consequently, the image quality of Newton's ringsfringe pattern is improved, which is beneficial to optical metrology. \u00a9 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",

However, there are no tools currently available for error resilience in the FGS enhancement bitstream. This causes two problems when delivering the enhancement bitstream through an error-prone channel. First, there is only a weak error detection capability in the enhancement layer. The decoder would put a lot of wrong data into the decoded video before it knows an error has occured in the bitstream. Secondly, in the current FGS scheme, once the decoder detects an error, it would discard the rest of the bitstream in that frame. The effective transmitted video data will be determined by the channel error rate, but not by the channel bandwidth. In this paper, we propose to include some error-resilience tools into the FGS enhancement layer bitstream. We design a hierarchical enhancement layer bitstream structure with resynchronization markers and Header Extension Code (HEC). The experimental results show that the proposed enhancement layer bitstream has stronger error detection and resynchronization capabilities when transmitted over error-prone channels. Thus it provides much better decoded video.",

        "abstract": "The traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (FT-OFDM) signals are vulnerable to be detected and intercepted, which limit the application in secure communication. In this paper, we use the OFDM systems based on fractional Fourier transform (FRFT-OFDM), then analyze their advantage of low detection and low interception through peak-to-average power ratio and encrypted modulation parameters. First, the PAPR of this system is lower than the counterpart of traditional OFDM systems by inhibiting PAPR in some fractional orders due to the difference of chirp signals' energy collect. So the symbol characteristics are not obvious, and the signals are difficult to be detected by non-cooperative receiver. Second, non-cooperative receiver is difficult to demodulate signals correctly for the demodulation is sensitive to different fractional orders. Finally, the BER performance of the system is about 1.5 dB lower than traditional OFDM systems after zero-forcing equalization under the same channel condition.",

The short-time fractional Fourier transform (STFRFT) is proposed to solve this problem. It displays the time and FRFD-frequency information jointly in the short-time fractional Fourier domain (STFRFD). Two aspects of its performance are considered: the 2-D resolution and the STFRFD support. The time-FRFD-bandwidth product (TFBP) is defined to measure the resolvable area and the STFRFD support. The optimal STFRFT is obtained with the criteria that maximize the 2-D resolution and minimize the STFRFD support. Its inverse transform, properties and computational complexity are presented. Two applications are discussed: the estimations of the time-of-arrival (TOA) and pulsewidth (PW) of chirp signals, and the STFRFD filtering.

A modified STAP is put forward to suppress the clutter while retain the phase history of the moving target. The concept of the `weight signal' was proposed to retrieve the phase history of the moving target, which was damaged by the STAP due to the optimum SAR clutter cancellation.

By introducing a non-singular matrix and an auxiliary vector uncorrelated with the noise, the unified framework is established. Since there are rich possibilities of the choices of the introduced matrix and vector, the proposed unified framework is very flexible. It can be verified that the existing BCP-based methods are special cases of the achieved result. It also shows that the unified framework can be used for deriving new or simplified versions of the BCP type methods.",

The implementation of the Chinese standard digital television terrestrial\n broadcasting (DTTB) creates a new opportunity for passive radar. DTTB system contains single-carrier and multicarrier application\n modes. In this paper, ambiguity functions of the DTTB signals in the single-carrier and multicarrier application modes are\n analyzed. Ambiguity function of the DTTB signal contains one main peak and many side peaks. The relative positions and amplitudes\n of the side peaks are derived and the reasons for the occurrence of the side peaks are obtained. The side peaks identification\n (SPI) algorithm is proposed for avoiding the false alarms caused by the side peaks. Experimental results show that the SPI\n algorithm can indentify all the side peaks without the power loss. This research provides the foundation for designing the\n DTTB based passive radar.",

Based on the cross-ambiguity function, the fractional cross-ambiguity function algorithm is realized by the two-step FFTs, and then the keystone transform is inserted into the two-step FFTs.

Greedy pursuit algorithms such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) are well-known recovery algorithms in CS. In this study, the authors study a modified OMP proposed by Schnass et al., which uses a special sensing dictionary to identify the support of a sparse signal while maintaining the same computational complexity. The performance guarantee of this modified OMP in recovering the support of a sparse signal is analysed in the framework of mutual (cross) coherence. Furthermore, they discuss the modified OMP in the case of bounded noise and Gaussian noise, and show that the performance of the modified OMP in the presence of noise relies on the mutual (cross) coherence and the minimum magnitude of the non-zero elements of the sparse signal. Finally, simulations are constructed to demonstrate the performance of the modified OMP.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) based multi-carrier order division multi-access communication system, in which each user is uniquely identified by an FrFT order. Transform domain communication system (TDCS) with FrFT scheme is also proposed to synthesize the wide-band baseband waveforms in all FrFT domains with different users' FrFT orders, which enhances the interference avoidance capability of this system under most of interference. Therefore, multiple independent data streams can be transmitted by using FrFT---OFDM in the same time and different FrFT domains. However, chirp bases, as the new kind of carriers with different modulated rates, are merely mutually approximately orthogonal. There is a problem of energy leakage between multiple chirp carriers, which possibly causes the multiple chirp carriers inter-shielding to influence the FrFT---OFDM demodulation performance. An efficient allocation algorithm of multiple chirp carriers by presetting the carrier parameters is proposed to solve this problem. Based on MC-CDMA, a variable bit rate system structure is proposed for TDCS with FrFT scheme under different channel environments. In order to simplify the process of modulation and demodulation of TDCS with FrFT scheme, a whole new cyclic shift key modulation mode in FrFT domain is also proposed. Both theories and simulations confirm strictly the validity of the proposed system.",

Even though the properties and applications of these formulae have been studied extensively in the literature, none of the research papers throw light on the Poisson sum formula and non-band-limited signals associated with the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT). This paper investigates the generalized pattern of Poisson sum formula from the FrFT point of view and derived several novel sum formulae associated with the FrFT. Firstly, the generalized Poisson sum formula is obtained based on the relationship of the FrFT and the Fourier transform; then some new results associated with this novel sum formula have been derived; the potential applications of these new results in estimating the bandwidth and the fractional spectrum shape of a signal in the fractional Fourier domain are also proposed. In addition, the results can be seen as the generalization of the classical results in the Fourier domain.",

        "abstract": "The ambiguity function (AF) as an important tool for time-frequency analysis, has widely been used in radar signal processing, sonar technology and so on. It does well in analysing chirp signals. However, it fails in estimating the cubic phase (CP) signal, which is required in many applications. As the generalisation of the Fourier transform (FT), the linear canonical transform (LCT) has received much attention, and has found many applications in filter design, pattern recognition, optics and so on. In this study, the authors define a new kind of AF - the AF based on the LCT (LCTAF), which is proposed to estimate the CP signal. Some important properties of LCTAF are discussed, such as symmetry and conjugation property, shifting property and Moyal formula. The relationships between the LCTAF and other time-frequency analysis distributions are derived, including the classical AF, the Wigner distribution function (WDF) based on LCT, the short-FT and the wavelet transform. The linear canonical AF (LCAF) is another kind of AF. The authors also discuss its relation with AF and WDF and give some new properties of the LCAF. At last, the LCTAF is applied for estimating the CP signal. The simulation indicates that the LCTAF is useful and effective. \u00a9 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",

        "abstract": "Sampling is one of the fundamental topics in the signal processing community. Theorems proposed under this topic form the bridge between the continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals. Several sampling theorems, which aid in the reconstruction of signals in the linear canonical transform (LCT) domain, have been proposed in the literature. However, two main practical issues associated with the sampling of the LCT still remain unresolved. The first one relates to the reconstruction of the original signal from nonuniform samples and the other issue relates to the fact that only a finite number of samples are available practically. Focusing on these issues, this paper seeks to address the above from the LCT point of view. First, we extend several previously developed theorems for signals band-limited in the Fourier domain to signals band-limited in the LCT domain, followed by the derivation of the reconstruction formulas for finite uniform or recurrent nonuniform sampling points associated with the LCT. Simulation results and the potential applications of the theorem are also proposed.",

The theorem for the multirate filter bank in the FRFD leads to the efficient structure of filtering in the FRFD and the multi-resolution analysis of signal in the FRFD. But the existing perfect reconstruction filter banks in the FRFD are of special form, which cannot satisfy some practices. This paper proposes the generalized design method for the perfect reconstruction filter banks in the FRFD based on the FRFD analysis of sampling rate conversion and the fractional convolution theorem, which are the basis of the applications of filter bank theory in the FRFD.

        "abstract": "The sea surface has the fractal nature. For normal incidence, some methods have been developed for extracting fractal parameters from the electromagnetic (EM) scattered signals. When the EM waves of different incident angles are scattered by the fractal sea surface, the scattered signal recorded at observation point will show many different properties, which will affect the accuracy of estimation of fractal parameters. In this paper, based on the method of skeleton of wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM), we analyze the hierarchical structures of the EM scattered signals at different incident angles to estimate the lacunarity of the fractal surface. It is shown that the optimal incident angle is between the sea surface and incident pulse passing through the mirror position of observation point and the midpoint of one-dimensional sea surface, approximately. The results of simulation are found interestingly successful to use the estimated parameters in remote sensing applications.",

        "abstract": "High-resolution inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of a ship target is a challenging task because of fluctuation with the ocean waves. The images obtained with a standard range-Doppler algorithm are usually blurred. Consequently, the range-instantaneous-Doppler (RID) technique should be used to improve the image quality. In this paper, the received signal in a range cell is modeled as a multicomponent quadratic frequency-modulated (QFM) signal after range compression and motion compensation, and then a new RID ISAR imaging algorithm is proposed that introduces a new method for estimating parameters of the QFM signal. By defining a new function and using the scaled Fourier transform (SCFT) with respect to the time axis, the coherent integration of auto-terms can be realized via the subsequent Fourier transformation with respect to the lag-time axis, and a peak can be obtained in the 2-D frequency plane, which is appropriate for parameter estimation of the QFM signal to reconstruct RID images. The proposed algorithm is accurate and fast since the defined function has moderate order nonlinearity and the SCFT can be performed via chirp z-transform. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm. Comparisons with existing algorithms are also given, which show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently produce a focused image with less fake scatterers.",

The method simplified the Petri net construction and gave a clear flow chart for scheduling. Hence, the auxiliary resource allocation could be easily carried out according to the schedule, which was proposed by heuristic search algorithm.

Many well-known transforms such as the Fourier transform, the fractional Fourier transform, and the Fresnel transform can be seen as special cases of the linear canonical transform. In this paper, new sampling formulae for reconstructing signals that are band-limited or time-limited in the linear canonical transform sense have been proposed. Firstly, the sampling theorem representation of band-limited signals associated with linear canonical transform from the samples taken at Nyquist rate is derived in a simple way. Then, based on the relationship between the Fourier transform and the linear canonical transform, the other two new sampling formulae using samples taken at half the Nyquist rate from the signal and its first derivative or its generalized Hilbert transform are obtained. The well-known sampling theorems in Fourier domain or fractional Fourier domain are shown to be special cases of the achieved results. The experimental results are also proposed to verify the accuracy of the obtained results. Finally, discussions about these new results and future works related to the linear canonical transform are proposed.",

The general approach to this problem is to compute attack graphs using a variety of graph-based algorithms. However, such methods generally suffer the exponential state space problem.

An algorithm based on vulnerability correlation matrix was proposed to generate VCGs. An example was given to illustrate the application and effect of the algorithm in network security analysis. Deep analysis proves that VCGs have polynomial complexity of the number of network vulnerabilities and scale well for large networks.

The signals are analyzed within the bilinear time\u2013frequency (TF) representation framework, where a TF kernel is designed by exploiting the inherent FH signal structures. The designed kernel permits effective suppression of cross-terms and artifacts due to missing observations while preserving the FH signal autoterms. The kerneled results are represented in the instantaneous autocorrelation function domain, which are then processed using a redesigned structure-aware Bayesian compressive sensing algorithm to accurately estimate the FH signal TF spectrum. The proposed method achieves high-resolution FH signal spectrum estimation even when a large portion of data observations is missing. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over existing techniques.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   High-resolution inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging based on parameter estimation of polynomial phase signal is a quite significant research hotspot, in which the azimuth echo can be modeled as multi-component quadratic frequency modulation (QFM) signal after preprocessing, which leads to the time-varying Doppler frequency. In this paper, an effective parameter estimation method called the product form of symmetric correlation function based on the fractional Fourier transform (PFrSCF) is proposed. In proposed method, a novel symmetric correlation function is used to reduce phase order of QFM signal firstly. Then, the PFrSCF can estimate two parameters of QFM signal simultaneously by the fractional Fourier transform and suppress cross term by the product in fractional Fourier transform domain. Compared with other methods, the PFrSCF is capable of suppressing cross term effectively and ensuring the good accuracy of parameters. Moreover, the PFrSCF is robust in noisy environment. Finally, associated with range-instantaneous-Doppler imaging technology, a novel ISAR imaging algorithm is presented based on PFrSCF method. The performances of PFrSCF method and the corresponding ISAR imaging algorithm of target are verified by simulated and real data.",

        "abstract": "Echo model and ambiguity function for a slowly fluctuating moving target were established by the distance r between the target and the reference point at which the target moving direction intersects the baseline, the angle \u03b1 between the target moving direction and the baseline, the ratio n in which the baseline is divided by reference point and the baseline range L as arguments in any bistatic triangle plane. The signal delay at receiver was approximately calculated using Taylor series expansion which was derived by T. Tsao. Based on the model above mentioned, the ambiguity function is more of universal significance and simplified because of the randomicity of reference point target and hypothesized point target selected and no north-referenced coordinate system required.",

        "abstract": "Fine Granularity Scalable (FGS) video coding scheme provides a layered bitstream structure with different importance at different layers. This property makes FGS bitstream more suitable for transmission over the error-prone channels with unequal error protection schemes. Even though the hierarchical FGS enhancement bitstream can always resynchronize in the next video packet when there are transmission errors, each error will still cause a large amount of received enhancement bits undecodable due to the dependency among enhancement layers. In this paper, we first propose to use the Universal VLC (UVLC) technique to further limit the effects of transmission errors to within one or only a few blocks by taking advantage of the excellent self-synchronization property of the UVLC. Furthermore, the higher priority data of Coded Bit Pattern (CBP) is separated from the DCT data in the same video packet and put in the beginning of each video packet to avoid the error impact from the DCT coefficients. The experimental results show that the FGS enhancement bitstream with the proposed coding techniques has greater capability in locating and isolating errors and resynchronization. The decodable bits of FGS enhancement layer increase significantly while the bit rate increases. Meanwhile, the decoded video quality can be improved up to 0.8dB in PSNR.",

But, it is hard to find a proper means of expression as the randomicity and complexity of television picture signal. On the basis of analysis and colligation for the characteristics of television signal, a simulated black-and-white whole television signal is produced using the rectangular signals with different amplitude, duration, frequency and phase in the paper. After the signal is processed through a low-pass filter, a very realistic waveform is obtained which can show pulsed nature, frequency, amplitude and bandwidth of television picture signals. The signal ensures the variety of television picture signal as well as the correlatability of the signals in adjacent line periods. In view of comparison with the analysis for the ambiguity function and resolution of the simulated signal and real picture signal, the results basically accord with the theoretical analysis for the simulated signal. Thus, it allows the study of extraneous radiator detection based on television signal to take an important step forward to its actual application.",

In addition, we apply the SDFrFT to the synchronization of high dynamic direct-sequence spread-spectrum signals. Furthermore, a sparse fractional cross ambiguity function (SFrCAF) is developed, and the application of SFrCAF to a passive coherent location system is presented.

Firstly the mean location of each range profile is calculated. Then we fit the trajectory of them with linear regression model. Based on the straight line trajectory of range shift, range alignment can be accomplished. The proposed algorithm avoids the searching operation which is usually used in traditional algorithms. The computational complexity analysis shows that the computation burden of the novel algorithm is proportional to the data volume.

The transient part is relative only to several near input data bits, its states being finite, which means the transient part can be made into a table to be stored into a EPROM. Although the stable part is relative to the history of all the input data, the triangle function values of it are \u00b11, which only cause the sign of the transient part changing.

In addition, for solving lower efficiency of zoom-FRFT for small M, a FRFT single-point fast computation (SP-FRFT) method based on Homer rule is presented and its further reduction is made for zero-point computation. It can be used to increase computational efficiency for small M, and compute un-uniform output samples. Finally, two methods are verified by the simulations.",

        "abstract": "An interference suppression algorithm is proposed to meet challenges of the traditional technique in dealing with the linear\n frequency modulation (LFM) interference, such as high loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise\n ratio (SINR) sensitive to input interference-to-signal ratio (ISR) that results in an unstable synchronization, and the spectrum\n leakage serious in strong ISR situation. This approach firstly makes use of the windowed and lapped technique to the fractional\n Fourier transform (FRFT) to enhance the ISR improvement and lower the SNR loss. Then by weakening the interference and a secondary\n threshold process, interference energy can be suppressed as much as possible and the output SINR is less sensitive to the\n ISR. Finally, a joint fractional Fourier domain and time domain technique is proposed to overcome the residual interference\n energy caused by the strong interference or the discontinuous-phase interference. Theoretical analysis and simulation results\n show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the conventional methods in suppressing both the multi\n period LFM interference and the multi chirp-rate LFM interference, especially in the strong interference environment.",

        "abstract": "Nonuniform sampling occurs in many applications due to imperfect timebase or random events. Periodic nonuniform sampling is a special type of nonuniform sampling. The properties and applications of periodic nonuniform sampling signals in traditional Fourier domain have been extensively studied, but so far none of the research papers covering the spectral analysis and reconstruction of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals in fractional Fourier domain have been published. This correspondence is to explore the spectral properties of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals associated with the fractional Fourier transform. First, based on the uniform fractional Fourier transform kernel, the general spectral representation of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals has been derived. Second, detailed analysis of periodic nonuniformly sampled chirp signals in the fractional Fourier domain have been performed. The results can be used to estimate the chirp rate and the sampling offsets. Finally, a more simple relationship between the discrete fractional spectrum of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals and the continuous spectrum has been obtained. Based on this relationship, the original continuous spectrum can be reconstructed from periodic nonuniformly sampled signals in fractional Fourier domain. In addition, the simulations are carried out to verify the correctness of the results.",

        "abstract": "Autofocus is very important to the imaging of air-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). There have been many kinds of the autofocus technique, which could fall into two categories according to whether the phase error is approximated with a parametric model or not. On the condition that prominent points exist in the image, the non-parametric methods have superiority over the parametric ones in dealing with high-order phase errors due to their high precision and appropriate computational complexity. As will be shown in this paper, the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) plays a pivotal roll in this kind of autofocus. The timefrequency filtering is introduced because of its extraordinary performance in raising the SCR of time-variant signals. Since the main part of the phase error is quadratic, the short-time fractional Fourier domain (STFRFD) filtering is utilized, and then a novel autofocus method termed timefrequency filtering-based autofocus (TFFA) is proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulations show the validity of this approach. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Analytical derivation of scattered field from rough ocean surface can be accomplished by a two-step analysis involving ocean surface modeling and scattered-field calculation. In the first step, the simplest linear model is constructed by assuming a rough ocean state as composition of infinite number of linear waves with identical crests and troughs. Unfortunately, regardless of ocean circumstances, ocean surface waves always exceed the linear range and yield a typical nonlinear asymmetric waveform with sharper peaks and shallow troughs. In this paper, by using curve-fit method and the concept of fractal geometry, we propose a new fractal function named fractional Weierstrass function which may be viewed as a generalization of classical Weierstrass function, and then, a fractional Weierstrass model for ocean surface is proposed by combining the fractional Weierstrass function with the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. An important advantage of our proposed model is the ability to represent nonlinearity with different degrees of ocean surface depending on a new parameter c. Some simulations demonstrate ratio c as an invariant scale of fractal ocean surface. The second step is strongly related to the surface modeling result of the first step. Within Kirchhoff approximation, an analytical derivation of scattered field in a closed form is obtained from our proposed fractional Weierstrass model surface. Moreover, some related discussions, including the normalization constant of the model, the correlation length, the scattered-field structure, and the influence of fractal and electromagnetic parameters over scattered field, are given. Finally, edge effects caused by the truncation of scatterer surface are also analyzed in detail.",

Computing load and admission region of the new algorithm were analyzed, while numerical examples and comparisons with classical non-parametric method were also included. Computing burden was reduced, and more accurate estimation of CLR was obtained. The admission region of new algorithm was larger than typical non-parametric approach and was variable according to the burst length. The calculation burden of new algorithm for CLR estimation is lighter than classical non-parametric approach.

The currently used model-based test method has only limited applications in low resolution converters (below 10 bit, for example) with the lack of taking account of the superposition errors. Facing the challenge, a test strategy of model-based measurement for A/D and D/A converters proposed in this paper is applied to solve the above-mentioned problem. In order to predict the converter specifications in full-code states with a few test data, an error model of A/D and D/A converters has to be built. Through building the error model, the measurement problem can be converted to the system identification problem of which variables are bit states, and estimated parameters are significant bit errors and superposition errors. The test codes are well selected with statistical experimental optimal design method. Using the selected test codes, we can get a set of sufficient and necessary test data with which the significant bit errors and the superposition errors can be accurately estimated and the full-code-state specifications of A/D and D/A converters can also be predicted. Results of laboratory experiments verify that this test strategy can well solve the contradiction between measurement cycle and accuracy. The proposed test method can provide a new approach to a highly efficient product check and specification test for high resolution A/D and D/A converters.",

In this letter, a novel CS-SAR imaging algorithm is proposed, which consists of 2-D undersampling, range reconstruction, range-azimuth decoupling, and azimuth reconstruction. In the proposed algorithm, the range profile is reconstructed in the fractional Fourier domain, and range-azimuth decoupling in the case of azimuth undersampling is realized by using the reference function multiplication and chirp-z transform. Comparisons with the existing 2-D undersampling CS-SAR imaging algorithms are also presented.

To show the estimation effect, the unbiasedness, the variance, and the optimal estimation condition are analyzed. The reconstruction of the fractional spectrum from the periodic random samples is also proposed. Second, the effects of sampling jitters and observation errors on the performance of the fractional spectrum estimation are analyzed, where the new defined fractional characteristic function is used to compensate the estimation bias from sampling jitters.

As a type of signal processing tool, the fractional Fourier transform has been proved to be effective for solving problems in non-stationary signal processing. For non-stationary discrete-time signals, the reconstruction of uniformly sampled signals from non-uniform samples in the fractional Fourier domain is first derived in this study. Since only finite non-uniform samples are collected in practical applications, for preferable reconstruction, two types of symmetric extensions are considered in the reconstruction to overcome the discontinuity problem that exists in the periodisation of short non-stationary sequences, which is more critical than that of long sequences. In addition, the average signal-to-noise ratio is used to evaluate the performance of the reconstruction with two types of symmetric extensions. Simulations and two applications are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed reconstruction method.",

Motivated by the operator theory, a new unitary operator associated with the LCT is introduced. This new operator generalises the unitary fractional operator which is proposed by Akay et al. recently. Via operator manipulations, the authors also derive a new definition, the LCT correlation operation, and present an alternative and efficient implementation of it. It is shown that the proposed LCT autocorrelation corresponds to radial slices of the ambiguity function in the ambiguity plane. On the basis of this relationship, an application of the fast LCT autocorrelation for detection and parameter estimation with respect to the chirp rates of linear frequency modulated signals corrupted by noise is proposed.

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of spaceborne imaging techniques, object detection in optical remote sensing imagery has drawn much attention in recent decades. While many advanced works have been developed with powerful learning algorithms, the incomplete feature representation still cannot meet the demand for effectively and efficiently handling image deformations, particularly objective scaling and rotation. To this end, we propose a novel object detection framework, called optical remote sensing imagery detector (ORSIm detector), integrating diverse channel features extraction, feature learning, fast image pyramid matching, and boosting strategy. ORSIm detector adopts a novel spatial-frequency channel feature (SFCF) by jointly considering the rotation-invariant channel features constructed in frequency domain and the original spatial channel features (e.g., color channel, gradient magnitude). Subsequently, we refine SFCF using learning-based strategy in order to obtain the high-level or semantically meaningful features. In the test phase, we achieve a fast and coarsely-scaled channel computation by mathematically estimating a scaling factor in the image domain. Extensive experimental results conducted on the two different airborne datasets are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Histopathology image is an important basis for pathologists to evaluate disease at the cellular level and colon cancer tissue sections usually contain many different types of nuclei, which should be automatically detected and identified. However, the detection and the identification of cell nuclei are challenging tasks due to the complex tissue structure and the diversity of nuclear morphology. In this paper, a staged detection\u2013identification framework is proposed for cell nuclei in colon cancer histopathology images. First, nuclei positions are detected by a position of interest network, which encodes context-aware representation on input image and decodes features on proximity map. Meanwhile, a cascade residual fusion block is presented to enhance the detection performance during the decoding process. Second, a multicropping network is developed to identify the detected cell nuclei. For reducing the impact of uncertainty, a multicropping module is designed for effectively capturing contextual feature contents around the center of a nucleus. The proposed detection\u2013identification framework is evaluated on an available colorectal adenocarcinoma images data set, which has 100 images including more than 20 000 marked nuclei. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach demonstrates excellent performance with better prediction scores.",

        "abstract": "Random walk (RW) technique, with benefit of handling complicated boundaries, has recently drawn increasing attention in image segmentation. In this paper, RW is employed for urban remote sensing image segmentation. To deal with the complex spatial distribution with heterogeneous structures, a novel hierarchical-biased RW (HBRW) method is proposed. Firstly, edge regions extracted by fractional differential are combined with histograms to obtain plentiful features. Then, Dirichlet process mixture model is used to generate hierarchical global prior distribution and local seeds, which substitute manual scribbles. Moreover, the proposed model can adapt to different resolution segmentation tasks through adjusting the concentration parameter. Final segmentation output is obtained by biased RW. Experimental results on urban high-resolution remote sensing images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Analysis of closed-fringe patterns with quadratic phase that are often encountered plays an important role in optical interferometry. But because the frequency spectra of the two exponential signals that compose closed-fringe patterns overlap in the Fourier domain while one is clearly distinct from the other in the fractional Fourier domain, fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is a useful method for analyzing the images to provide parameter estimation. However, when the fringe pattern has varying background and/or modulation due to non-uniform illumination, parameter estimation accuracy based on FRFT is affected, which lacks theoretical justification. Thus, the impact of varying background and/or modulation on the FRFT is studied with theoretic analysis and presented in this paper. Key factors that contribute to the optimal results are discussed when employing three kinds of fringe normalization methods to eliminate the impact. Here, the fringe pattern is first processed by the normalization technique. Then the cosine-only term is used to estimate parameter by use of the FRFT-based method. Physical quantities are then obtained by parameter estimation. In comparison with our previous method based on FRFT, more accurate results are achieved. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach are demonstrated using simulation and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Newton\u2019s rings are often encountered in interferometry, and in analyzing them, we can estimate the physical parameters, such as curvature radius and the rings\u2019 center. The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is capable of estimating these physical parameters from the rings despite noise and obstacles, but there is still a small deviation between the estimated coordinates of the ringsu0027 center and the actual values. The least-squares fitting method is popularly used for its accuracy but it is easily affected by the initial values. Nevertheless, with the estimated results from the FRFT, it is easy to meet the requirements of initial values. In this paper, the proposed method combines the advantages of the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) with the least-squares fitting method in analyzing Newton\u2019s rings fringe patterns. Its performance is assessed by analyzing simulated and actual Newton\u2019s rings images. The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of estimating the parameters in the presence of noise and obstacles. Under the same conditions, the estimation results are better than those obtained with the original FRFT-based method, especially for the rings\u2019 center. Some applications are shown to illustrate that the improved FRFT-based method is an important technique for interferometric measurements.",

        "abstract": "Fast acquisition in space telemetry and telecontrol communication system is challenged significantly by the high dynamic and low signal-to-noise ratio. Increasing the dwell time to obtain better acquisition sensitivity, based on two-dimensional time-frequency search, is impossible because of resource limitation in receiver. To tackle these problems, this study proposes a two-stage differential acquisition (TSDA) algorithm. The differential coherent integration is employed by the first stage of TDSA to extend integration time, during which keystone transform and fast Fourier transform are used to compensate the linear code phase drift and obtain high accumulation gain. The carrier-frequency offset is estimated in terms of the code phase difference between the two parts of received signal divided by the second stage of TSDA in which the two-dimensional searching process is avoided. The proposed TSDA algorithm and the traditional acquisition methods are compared under the same acquisition time and typical parameters of S-band space telemetry and telecontrol communication system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TSDA algorithm attains a higher acquisition probability and better acquisition sensitivity than the traditional acquisition methods.",

Transmitting data are encoded by binary-resilient code and then decomposed into multiple orthogonal fractional-domains simultaneously to generate coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing based on multiorder FrFT (MFrFT-COFDM) symbols. In addition, transform-order (TO) signals are randomly spread by exploiting legitimate channel response and sent to the receiver in the physical layer. Due to channel reciprocity and spatial decorrelation, the legitimate user can access correct TOs, but the eavesdropper cannot. When all the TOs are correct, the MFrFT-COFDM can provide more reliable anti-multipath transmission than other related works because no additional interference is produced. However, as long as any one of the TO is wrong, the final decoding bit error rate will be 0.5. In order to retrieve desired data, the eavesdropper has to test a huge number of TO combinations, which is usually an impractical task. Computer simulations are carried out to validate this scheme.",

        "abstract": "SummaryTransform domain communication system is an adaptive anti-interference system that can dynamically generate interference-orthogonal waveforms. As a spread spectrum system, its low spectrum efficiency limits potential practical applications. In TDCS, cyclic code shift keying is an orthogonal modulation, whose symbols can be regarded as scalars in different dimensions. However, the constellation is restricted by signal time-bandwidth product. In this study, extending constellation is proven to be a valid approach to improve spectrum efficiency. The combinatory of multidimensional vectors is designed mathematically to increase the variety of the scalars with the minimum orthogonality damage. On the basis of the design, an efficient modulation scheme, namely, multidimensional parallel combinatory transform domain communication system, is proposed, whose fundamental modulation symbols can be represented by the combinatory of a series of cyclic code shift keying symbols with phase shift keying modulation. Compared with the existing methods, multidimensional parallel combinatory transform domain communication system can achieve a considerably higher spectrum efficiency. The bit error rate performance is also improved to various extents. Theoretical spectrum efficiency and bit error rate of the proposed method are derived for additive white Gaussian noise and typical multipath fading channels. System with different spectral conditions and channel estimation methods is also simulated and analyzed to confirm the practical usability.",

BICGFOCUSS was specifically designed to reduce the computational complexity of FOCUSS by solving a complex linear equation using the BICG method according to the rank of the weight matrix in FOCUSS. Experimental results show that BICG-FOCUSS is more efficient in terms of computational time than FOCUSS without losing accuracy. Since FOCUSS is an efficient tool for estimating the space-time clutter spectrum in sparse recoverybased space-time adaptive processing (SR-STAP), we propose BICG-FOCUSS to achieve a fast estimation of the space-time clutter spectrum in mono-static array radar and in the mountaintop system.

The restricted isometry property (RIP)-based condition of MMP that ensures accurate recovery of sparse signals in the noiseless case is derived by using a simple technique. The performance guarantees of the MMP for support recovery in noisy cases are also discussed. It is shown that under certain conditions on the RIP and minimum magnitude of nonzero components of the sparse signal, the MMP will exactly recover the true support of the sparse signal in cases of bounded noises and recover the true support with a high probability in the case of Gaussian noise. Our bounds on the RIP improve the existing results.",

The authors present a coherent integration architecture for PBR, which consists of a frequency-domain pulse compression module to reduce the overall runtime for the computation of the cross-ambiguity function, and an efficient decimated keystone transform module based on the chirp z-transform to compensate the range migration. The proposed architecture is then implemented in a hybrid central processing unit plus graphic processing unit scheme. Real measurement data are used to verify the superior integration performance and reduced computational complexity achieved by the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of distributed bias-compensated recursive least-squares (BC-RLS) estimation over multi-agent networks, where the agents collaborate to estimate a common parameter of interest. We consider the situation where both input and output of each agent are corrupted by unknown additive noise. Under this condition, traditional recursive least-squares (RLS) estimator is biased, and the bias is induced by the input noise variance. When the input noise variance is available, the effect of the noise-induced bias can be removed at the expense of an increase in estimation variance. Fortunately, it has been illustrated that distributed collaboration between agents can effectively reduce the variance and can improve the stability of the estimator. Therefore, a distributed incremental BC-RLS algorithm and its simplified version are proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithms can collaboratively obtain the estimates of the unknown input noise variance and remove the effect of the noise-induced bias. Then consistent estimation of the unknown parameter can be achieved in an incremental fashion. Simulation results show that the incremental BC-RLS solutions outperform existing solutions in some enlightening ways.",

We consider the situations that all nodes in the network are corrupted by both input and output noise. This yields into biased estimates by the distributed NLMS algorithms. In our analysis, we take all the noise into consideration and prove that the bias is dependent on the input noise variance. Therefore, we propose a bias compensation method to remove the noise-induced bias from the estimated results. In our development, we first assume that the variances of the input noise are known a priori and develop a series of distributed-based bias-compensated NLMS (BCNLMS) methods. Under various practical scenarios, the input noise variance is usually unknown a priori, therefore it is necessary to first estimate for its value before bias removal. Thus, we develop a real-time estimation method for the input noise variance, which overcomes the unknown property of this noise. Moreover, we perform some main analysis results of the proposed distributed BCNLMS algorithms. Furthermore, we illustrate the performance of the proposed distributed bias compensation method via graphical simulation results.",

        "abstract": "This study exploits wireless channel response and fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) to achieve anti-eavesdropping downlink transmission over a multipath channel. The proposed system works in time-division duplexing mode, and only the transmitter knows the main channel response through uplink services. With the use of the main channel information, a time-varying spread-spectrum orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TS-OFDM) subsystem is proposed to realise confidential transform order (TO) transmission, and a security-enhanced FrFT-OFDM (SE-FrFT-OFDM) subsystem is presented for high-rate data transmission. The optimal power allocation algorithms that optimise the average secrecy outage capacity of the TS-OFDM subsystem and the bit error rate performance of the SE-FrFT-OFDM subsystem are also provided. Given channel reciprocity and spatial decorrelation, the legitimate user can achieve optimal anti-multipath fading performance, but the intercepted data symbols will be randomised by both channel fading and TO deviations. To avoid randomisation, the eavesdropper has to test all possible TO combinations of multiple SE-FrFT-OFDM symbols, which is usually an impractical task. Compared to other typical methods, the transmitting power of the proposed system can be used more efficiently because the data symbol is not transmitted along with additional interference. Computer simulations are carried out to validate this scheme.",

The protein encoded by this gene has an important role in neural development and sialic acid synthesis on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Previous research had indicated that the promoter region of SIAT8B is associated with schizophrenia in the Japanese population. To take this further we carried out an association study based on 643 unrelated schizophrenics and 527 unrelated healthy subjects, all Han Chinese, recruited from Shanghai. Although our results differed from those of the Japanese research, rs3759915, also located in the promoter region of SIAT8B, showed nominally significant association with schizophrenia (P=0.0036). Moreover, haplotypes constructed from rs3759915 and another two SNPs reported in the Japanese study (rs3759914 and rs3759916, also located in promoter region of SIAT8B) which located in the same LD block were significantly associated with schizophrenia (global P=0.0000050). Our findings indicate that SIAT8B may be a candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population and may also provide further support for the potential importance of polysaccharide-synthesizing genes in the etiology of schizophrenia.",

The objective of this study was to explore the genetic polymorphisms and serum protein levels of MBL in Chinese pediatric patients with common infectious diseases, including recurrent respiratory infection (RRI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, localized abscess, and otitis media.MBL genetic polymorphisms of 151 pediatric patients with infectious diseases and 105 healthy controls were detected by PCR and sequencing. Serum MBL levels of all the patients and controls were measured using a Human MBL ELISA Kit. Differences in MBL genetic polymorphisms and serum levels between patients and controls were analyzed by statistical methods.The frequencies of allele H/L at position -550 of the promoter and three haplotypes - HYPA, HYPB, and LYPB - were statistically different between patients and controls (p<0.05). The frequencies of genotypes 'YA' and 'XB', relevant to serum protein levels, were also significantly different between patients and controls (p<0.05). Serum MBL levels of patients with active CMV infection were significantly lower than those of controls (p<0.05). Conversely, serum MBL levels of patients with ARI and localized abscess were significantly higher than those of controls (p<0.05).Genetic polymorphisms attributable to mutations in the promoter and exon 1 of the MBL2 gene appear to be relatively common in pediatric patients with infectious diseases. Low serum MBL levels may play a role in the high sensitivity of pediatric CMV infections.",

Results: The goodness-of-fit chi-square test showed that the genotypic distribution of rs1186679 didn't deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Haplotype relative risk (HRR) test did not show a genetic association between rs1186679 and schizophrenia (\u03c72 = 0.775, P > 0.05). Transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) did not show a significant biased transmission from parents to affected offsprings (\u03c72= 1.025, P>0.05).

The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) showed allelic association for rs1549637 (chi(2) = 5.68, uncorrected P = 0.017), but not for BanISNP and rs1648833. The conditioning on genotype (COG) test revealed a disease association for the BanISNP-rs1648833 combination (chi(2) = 12.54, df = 3, P = 0.0057) and for the BanISNP-rs1549637 combination (chi(2) = 9.72, df = 2, P = 0.021), but the conditioning on allele (COA) test did not show such an association for the above two combinations. Neither the COA test nor the COG showed a disease association for the rs1648833-rs1549637 combination. In the combination of all three SNPs, the COG test, but not the COA test, showed a strong association (chi(2) = 22.93, df = 6, P = 0.0008). These findings suggest that these three cPLA2 genes may all be involved in contributing to the etiology of schizophrenia although their effect size appears to be relatively small.",

        "title": "A family-based study of genetic association of the PTGDS gene with schizophrenia in a Chinese population",
        "abstract": "Several lines of evidence suggest that niacin-induced dermal flush may be a biomarker for schizophrenia (Ward et al., 1998; Puri et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2007). Up to 80% of schizophrenic patients show diminished niacin flush as compared with 20% of healthy individuals (Ward et al., 1998; Puri et al., 2001). As the niacin flush is highly inheritable (Waldo, 1999; Lin et al., 2007), the niacin skin test can be used as endophenotypes to track down a gene for schizophrenia. Many genes, however, are involved in the niacin flush pathway, including those for niacin receptors, phospholipase A2, prostaglandin synthases and receptors. The genes involved in the prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) pathway may be particularly important as niacin flush mainly reflects the PGD2-induced vasodilatation. In a recent study, Ruano et al., 2007 detected the PGD2 synthase (PTGDS) gene for genetic association with schizophrenia in Portuguese and Brazilian populations, but they failed to observe disease association. We have also recently tested the PTGDS gene for its association with the illness in a Chinese population. A total of 282 Chinese parent-offspring trios of Han descent were recruited for the genetic analysis. The patients (181 males and 101 females), aged 25.3\u00b16.7 years, were admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Northeast China during the period between 2000 and 2005. They were diagnosed as having schizophrenia using the ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: Tenth Revision) criteria. All the participants gave written informed consent for the genetic analysis as approved by the ethics committee of the Jilin University. A single nucleotide polymorphism, rs3814500 (MspI site) present in the promoter region of the PTGDS gene, was detected using PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. As the PTGDS gene spans just about 5 kb of DNA, the linkage disequilibrium signal detected at rs3814500 could cover the entire gene. The \u03c72 goodness-of-fit test showed that the genotypic distributions of rs3814500 were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the patient group and the parent group. Frequencies of the transmitted alleles were 101 (C) and 463 (T), and those of the nontransmitted, 105 (C) and 459 (T). The \u03c72 test did not show allelic association for rs3814500 (\u03c72=0.095, P=0.758). The present results support the initial conclusion that the PTGDS gene may not be associated with schizophrenia (Ruano et al., 2007). As there are a number of genes involved in the niacin flush pathway, deficits of anyone of them could lead to abnormal responses to niacin stimulation. Thus, it is important to detect more genes for the pathway in schizophrenia. \u00a9 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

The human KIF2 gene represents an orthologue of the murine Kif2a, which plays an important role in the transport of various membranous organelles and protein complexes on microtubules. To examine whether this gene is involved in schizophrenia etiology, we undertook studies of transmission disequilibrium in a cohort of affected family samples to test for association. Although, we failed to detect any positive results in single markers, a common two-SNP haplotype (rs2289883/rs464058, G/A) showed a significant association with the disease and a four-SNP haplotype (T/G/A/G) with a frequency of 23.4% was identified in parental chromosomes and showed a significant association with the disease (P=0.00795).

Methods The method of PCR- RFLP was conducted to examine the genotype of 3 cPLA2 genes ( PLA2G4A, PLA2G4B and PLA2G4C genes) in 263 subjects, including 121 cases of T2DM and 142 controls. The conditional test was used to test the combined effect of distinct loci on the T2DM by conditioning on allele (COA) or by conditioning on genotype (COG) with UNPHASED analysis platform. Results The genotypic frequencies of the 3 genes did not deviate from Hardy- weinberg equilibrium in both case and control groups. The allelic and genotypic frequencies of the 3 genes had no remarkable difference between case and control (P>0.05). The COG test revealed that T2DM was associated with the rs1648833-rs1549637 combination (P<0.05), but the COA test did not show such an association with the combination. Neither the COA test nor the COG showed that T2DM was associated with the BanISNP- rs1648833 and BanISNP-rs1549637 combination. In the combination of all 3 SNPs (BanISNP-rs1648833-rs1549637), the COA test and the COG test didn\u2032t show an association (P>0.05). Conclusion cPLA2 gene polymorphism may be involved in the etiology of T2DM in Northern Han Chinese, although their effects are relatively small.",

DNA microarray analysis of post-mortem brains of schizophrenics has indicated up-regulation of the mRNA level of PDLIM5, and Horiuchi and colleagues reported two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2433320 and rs2433322) in the 5' region of the PDZ and LIM domain 5 gene (PDLIM5) to be significantly associated with schizophrenia in the Japanese population. On the other hand, no association with schizophrenia was observed by Kato and colleagues in a different sample of the Japanese population. In this study, we genotyped six SNPs (including rs2433320 and rs2433322) covering PDLIM5 in 507 schizophrenia patients and 530 normal controls recruited from Jiangxi Province, China. Although rs2433320 was negative in our samples, rs2433322 showed significantly different frequencies between cases and controls (P=0.000010). In addition, high linkage disequilibrium was observed between rs2433320 and rs2433322 (D'=0.880), and haplotypes constructed from the two SNPs were significantly associated with schizophrenia (global P=0.00019, even after strict Bonferroni correction). Our results provide further evidence to support PDLIM5 as a potential susceptible gene for schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an important constituent of the human innate immune system, and can bind to a wide range of pathogens, including viruses such as influenza A, HIV, herpes simplex 2, and SARS-CoV. MBL deficiency results from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 1, and the promoter region of the human MBL2 gene has been found to be associated with susceptibility to a number of infections. However, studies on the interactions between MBL and CMV infection are limited. In this study, we investigated 104 children suffering from HCMV infection, in an effort to find any association between MBL and HCMV infection of children in China. We analyzed the genotypes of 104 HCMV patients and 105 healthy controls, and investigated the distributions of polymorphisms at -550(H/L), -221(Y/X), and +4(P/Q), together with their structural variants. Although there was no significant difference in the distribution of B alleles between HCMV patients and healthy controls, the frequencies of the high-MBL-level related genotype of YA type in HCMV patients were significantly lower than those seen in healthy controls, while low-level related genotypes of XB type were more common in HCMV patients. In addition, CMV-DNA quantification revealed higher viral loads of the XB type in HCMV patients. Thus we can speculate that as an acute response protein and a pattern-recognition molecule of the innate immune system, MBL may play a role in protecting against HCMV infection in children, and MBL gene mutations may be a significant risk factor for the development of infantile HCMV infection.",

        "abstract": "We report here the clinical, genetic, and molecular characteristics of a large Chinese family exhibiting non-syndromic, late-onset autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss. Clinical evaluation revealed variable phenotypes of hearing loss in terms of severity and age-at-onset of disease in these subjects. Genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the disease gene to the DFNA5 locus with a maximum two-point log odds score of 5.39 at [theta] = 0 for marker D7S2457. DNA sequencing of DFNA5 revealed a novel heterozygous IVS8+4 A>G substitution in the splice donor site of intron 8. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed skipping of exon 8 in the mutant transcript. This mutation faithfully cosegregated with hearing loss in the family. In addition, the mutation was absent in 100 unrelated control DNA samples of Chinese origin. The IVS8+4 A>G mutation is predicted to create a shift in the reading frame and introduce a stop codon at position 372, thereby resulting in a prematurely truncated DFNA5 protein. Up to date, a total of four mutations in DFNA5 have been reported to lead to hearing impairment, all of them result in skipping of exon 8 at the mRNA level. Our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that DFNA5-associated hearing loss is caused by a very specific gain-of-function mutation. \u00a9 2007 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.",

        "abstract": "We performed a two-stage linkage scan involving 25 Chinese schizophrenia families, focusing on 10 target chromosomes which have already been the subject of considerable research. We initially genotyped 237 individuals with 186 markers, five candidate regions were then chosen for fine mapping and 49 additional markers were genotyped. In region 1q21-23, a maximum multipoint HLOD (HLOD=2.38) was observed between D1S484 and D1S2705, under the dominant model. In region 5q35, dominant HOLD of 2.36, 2.04, and 2.31 were found at marker D5S2030, D5S408, and D5S2006, respectively. Consistent multipoint results also supported linkage to this region under the same dominant model, with a highest HOLD of 2.47. Furthermore, single-point HLODs (HLOD=1.95 at D22S274, and HLOD=1.91 at D22S1157) were found in region 22q13, under the dominant model. Evidence from these three regions satisfied the criteria for suggestive linkage and should help in identifying schizophrenia susceptibility genes.",

Methods: The PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique was conducted to examine the genotypes of rs2280250 locus of APOD gene in 291 family trios consisting of fathers, mothers, and affected offsprings with schizophrenia, and then the frequencies of genotype and allele of rs2280520 locus of APOD gene were statistically computed. Results: 1 The distribution of genotypic frequency of rs2280250 did not deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium either in the patient group (\u03c72=0.178, df=1, P=0.673) or in the parent group (\u03c7 2=0.597, df=1, P=0.440); 2 The transmission disquilibrium test (TDT) showed the allele transmitted from heterozygotic parents to affected offsprings did not bias from 50% (2=0.030, P= 0.862); 3 The haplotype-based haplotype relative risk test (HHRR) showed there was no significant difference of frequency distribution of allele of rs2280250 between patient group and parent group (\u03c72=0.055, P=0.815). Conclusion: The polymorphism of rs2280250 at the APOD locus may not be associated with schizophrenia in North Chinese Han population.",

A total of 236 Chinese parent-offspring trios of Han descent were recruited for the genetic analysis. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) did not show allelic association either for rs2459692 (chi(2) = 0.217, P = 0.641) or for rs4924618 (chi(2) = 0.663, P = 0.416). To see the combined effect of the PLA2G4D locus with the other three PLA2G4 genes, we applied the above two SNPs as a conditional marker to test the pair-wise combination for a disease association. The conditioning on allele (COA) test revealed a weak association for the rs2459692-PLA2G4A combination (chi(2) = 6.03, df = 2, P = 0.049), the rs2459692-PLA2G4B combination (chi(2) = 7.16, df = 3, P = 0.028) and the rs4924618-PLA2G4C combination (chi(2) = 7.01, df = 2, P = 0.03), whereas the conditioning on genotype (COG) test showed a weak association only for the rs4924618-PLA2G4C combination (chi(2) = 8.52, df = 3, P = 0.036). Because we performed a multi-locus analysis in this study, the weak association shown by the conditional tests could make little biological sense. In conclusion, the PLA2G4D gene may not be involved in a susceptibility to schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Using nationally representative data, the present paper examines the impact of China's ongoing rural tax reform on farmers. The difficulties in further local governance restructuring are also discussed. It is argued that the issues associated with rural taxation and local governance in China result from inherent tension between an increasingly liberalized economic system and a still centralized political system. Although rural tax reform has helped to reduce farmers' tax burdens in the short term, the establishment of an effective local governance regime requires coordinated reforms to downsize local bureaucracy by providing social security for laid-off cadres, to strengthen local accountability by granting higher local formal tax autonomy, and to promote meaningful participation by expanding local democracy.",

        "abstract": "Democratic governance is believed to improve government responsiveness to citizens\u2019 demand for public goods. In China, villagers\u2019 committee elections represent a major progress in China\u2019s development toward good governance. We develop a rational model to explain villagers\u2019 participation. Utilizing a national survey of rural residents in 2005, this paper tests the insights of the model. Two findings are of interest to the students of voting and elections. First, there is disagreement over the causal relationship between political trust and voting. This paper offers a rational interpretation of political trust by emphasizing the informational aspect of the concept. Second, voting is generally theorized as a process of overcoming various costs. The prospect of benefits figures more prominently in Chinese village elections. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of township governments in China\u2019s rural politics and reveal the inner dilemma of democratization in China.",

        "abstract": "Safe and affordable housing is accepted as a basic right in the modern world. Studies on transitional societies have demonstrated how politicized the housing market can become and how housing consumption is determined by both economic forces and public rules. Rural housing in China offers a unique institutional environment. While residential land is collectively owned and allocated, villagers have the freedom to make decisions with regard to construction space. Drawing on a large national survey, this paper provides the first systematic analysis of the consequences of these different institutional rules. In terms of housing resources, residential land is distributed in a relatively equitable fashion, but the building of structures on that land is defined by a higher degree of social stratification. These findings extend the current literature and confirm the power of institutional rules in housing consumption. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Our analysis suggests that teachers\u2019 incentives and students\u2019 education performance are unlikely to benefit from the excessive centralisation of decision-making power or from incessant horizontal level power struggles among different government bodies.",

However, the literature so far has paid insufficient attention to the patterns and efficiencies of this type of land use. To fill in this gap, this paper uses a national survey to analyze the institutional setups for rural residential land use, to assess the effectiveness of existing regulations, and to evaluate the efficiencies in rural residential land use. Farmers' subjective receptiveness toward rural residential property regulation reform is also investigated. We find that rural residential properties are inefficiently utilized under the existing land use regulations, that those who are younger and who had previous migration experiences are more likely to support the free trading of rural residential properties while the village cadres are more likely to oppose it. A coordinated policy reform package that includes free trading of rural residential properties and Household Registration System to facilitate permanent migration out of the countryside is proposed to address the existing efficiencies in China's rural residential land use. \u00a9 2011.",

While insightful, a comprehensive understanding also needs to take into account the supply side. The state, as the ultimate supplier of institutional changes, plays the pivotal role of agency; therefore, its willingness and ability decide how such regime change occurs and what particular form the new regime takes. Since the mid-1990s, the Chinese economy has embarked on a path of rapid industrialization and urbanization. The contestation over rural land development rights in China offers an excellent case to illuminate the importance of state agency in institutional changes. Drawing on case studies in China's three major urbanizing regions, this article analyzes how villages brought their own land directly to the land market and reaped handsome profits. We argue that the three successful cases, Nanhai in Guangdong, Kunshan in Jiangsu and Zhenggezhuang in Beijing, all represent a product of active agency on the supply side. The Chinese state's fragmented authority provides a favorable institutional environment for such changes. \u00a9 2013 The Authors China & World Economy \u00a9 2013 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.",

This article explores the innovative reforms adopted by Zhejiang Province through land development rights (LDR) transfer within a locality and LDR trading across localities. We argue that there is a \"Zhejiang model of LDR transferring and trading,\" which, we believe, has significant implications not only for fostering an efficiency-enhancing market for land development rights and agricultural land preservation, but also for optimal use of land and a more balanced regional development. One important policy issue relating to China's rural land system is that under China's land requisition system, farmers are usually under compensated for urban land-taking.",

        "abstract": "This paper is an attempt to present an analysis of China's decentralization and local governance practices, the dilemmas rooted in the current institution. We argue that the misbehavior of local government officials is endogenous to China's central-local structure and that competition among localities has become distorted and constrained by various policy burdens and development mandates imposed from above. The information asymmetry for the enforcement cost of mandates that exists between central and local governments not only leads to difficulties and distortions in local performance evaluations, but also creates opportunities for local bureaucracy expansion and rent-seeking. Enhancing fiscal transfers, or strengthening political restraint, although necessary, would be far from enough to solve the local governance problems. The ultimate solution entails an in-depth deregulation reform on factor mobility and a furthest eradication of policy mandates for the local government.",

        "title": "To reallocate or not: Reconsidering the dilemma in China's agricultural land tenure policy",
        "abstract": "In China, rural land is collectively owned at the village level. Village officials usually have the power to reallocate land property across families on an ongoing basis due to demographic changes in the village. Realizing that frequent land reallocation and abusive land requisition will undermine economic productivity as well as social stability, the \u201cRural Land Contract Law\u201d passed in 2002 explicitly reads that farmland tenure security must be maintained for at least 30 years since the last nationwide reallocation in 1998. The frequency and magnitude of land reallocation in Chinese villages have decreased as a result. However, failure to allocate land to the newly increased population often induced conflicts among village members if the security of land tenure for 30 years was strictly implemented. Administrative land reallocations then still continued in some villages to accommodate demographic changes in these places. Based on an almost nationally representative rural dataset collected in 119 villages of 6 provinces across China in 2008, this paper lays out some stylized facts about the administrative land reallocation after 1998. By analyzing the opinions of over 2200 farmers on the central policy of maintaining farmland tenure security, we are able to rationalize why some farmers support the policy while others oppose it. This analysis helps us to better understand the dilemma between efficiency and equity embedded in the current agricultural land system in China. It is further shown that social conflicts among village members may easily arise either due to administrative land reallocation or due to lack of it. We argue that this dilemma cannot be resolved effectively without coordinated reforms in household registration system which can help hundreds of millions of Chinese rural migrant workers to permanently settle in cities and release their farmland to those who stay in the countryside.",

This article explores the innovative reforms adopted by Zhejiang Province through land development rights (LDR) transfer within a locality and LDR trading across localities. We argue that there is a \"Zhejiang model of LDR transferring and trading,\" which, we believe, has significant implications not only for fostering an efficiency-enhancing market for land development rights and agricultural land preservation, but also for optimal use of land and a more balanced regional development. One important policy issue relating to China's rural land system is that under China's land requisition system, farmers are usually under compensated for urban land-taking.",

However, as agricultural liberalization progressed, the traditional tax instruments of 'tax deduction prior to grain procurement payment' and implicit taxation through 'price scissors' gradually eroded. Under such a circumstance, local governments in agriculture-based regions resorted to informal fees collected directly from individual rural households while the more industrialized regions shifted to non-agricultural taxes that are less costly in terms of tax collection. Empirical evidence based on a large panel data set supports our hypotheses of rural taxation in China. \u00a9 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

Numerous experimental and clinical studies indicate that manipulating the balance between regulatory and responder T cells is an effective strategy to control immune responsiveness after transplantation.Literature search was conducted using PubMed on the related subjects. Part of the material was based on the most recent work in the authors' laboratory.We propose some new strategies to achieve transplant tolerance in rodent animals via manipulating Treg function, including using histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor to regulate Foxp3 transcription and enhance Treg suppression, induction of Treg-sparing apoptosis via Nur77, and identification of the co-inhibitory molecule herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) as an effector molecule for Treg function.Regulation of Treg function will definitely provide us very promising tools to achieve clinical tolerance in the future.",

        "abstract": "The NR4A nuclear receptor family member Nur77 (NR4A1) promotes thymocyte apoptosis during negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes, but may also function in mature extrathymic T cells. We studied the effects of over-expression of Nur77 on the apoptosis of murine peripheral T cells, including thymic-derived Foxp3+ regulatory (Treg) cells. Overexpression of Nur77 in the T cell lineage decreased numbers of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells by approximately 80% compared to wild-type (WT) mice. However, the proportions of Treg cells were markedly increased in the thymus (61% of CD4+Foxp3+ singly positive thymocytes vs. 8% in WT) and secondary lymphoid organs (40-50% of CD4+Foxp3+ T cells vs. 7-8% in WT) of Nur77 transgenic (Nur77Tg) mice, and immunoprecipitation studies showed Nur77 was associated with a recently identified HDAC7/Foxp3 transcriptional complex. Upon activation through the T cell receptor in vitro or in vivo, Nur77Tg T cells showed only marginally decreased proliferation but significantly increased apoptosis. Fully allogeneic cardiac grafts transplanted to Nur77Tg mice survived long-term with well-preserved structure, and recipient splenocytes showed markedly enhanced apoptosis and greatly reduced anti-donor recall responses. Allografts in Nur77Tg recipients had significantly increased expression of multiple Treg-associated genes, including Foxp3, Foxp1, Tip60 and HDAC9. Allograft rejection was restored by CD25 monoclonal antibody therapy, indicating that allograft acceptance was dependent upon Treg function in Nur77Tg recipients. These data show that compared to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells, Foxp3+ Tregs are relatively resistant to Nur77-mediated apoptosis, and that tipping the balance between the numbers of Tregs and responder T cells in the early period post-transplantation can determine the fate of the allograft. Hence, induced expression of Nur77 might be a novel means to achieve long-term allograft survival.",

We found that administration of an HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) in vivo increased Foxp3 gene expression, as well as the production and suppressive function of regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells). Although T(reg) cells express multiple HDACs, HDAC9 proved particularly important in regulating Foxp3-dependent suppression. Optimal T(reg) function required acetylation of several lysines in the forkhead domain of Foxp3, and Foxp3 acetylation enhanced binding of Foxp3 to the Il2 promoter and suppressed endogenous IL-2 production. HDACi therapy in vivo enhanced T(reg)-mediated suppression of homeostatic proliferation, decreased inflammatory bowel disease through T(reg)-dependent effects, and, in conjunction with a short course of low-dose rapamycin, induced permanent, T(reg)-dependent cardiac and islet allograft survival and donor-specific allograft tolerance. Our data show that use of HDACi allows the beneficial pharmacologic enhancement of both the numbers and suppressive function of Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells.",

Experimentally, in vivo and in vitro studies show histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can enhance the numbers and suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) by promoting Foxp3+ cell production, enhancing chromatin remodeling within Tregs, and inducing acetylation of Foxp3 protein itself. Human studies consistent with a role for HDACi in controlling Fox3-dependent Treg functions are also available. We review these molecular interactions and how they may be exploited therapeutically to enhance Treg-dependent functions, including post-transplantation.",

        "abstract": "The histone/protein deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), trichostatin A (TsA), increases the production and suppressive function of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (T(regs)), at least in part, by promoting the acetylation of Foxp3 protein itself. Acetylation of Foxp3 is required for effective binding of Foxp3 to the promoter of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene and the suppression of IL-2 expression. We have sought to identify agents that had similar effects on T(regs), but without the associated toxicity of TsA. This review summarizes the contrasting effects of various HDACis on T(reg) functions in vitro and in vivo. Agents that block primarily class I HDAC had minimal or no effect on T(reg) suppression, whereas multiple inhibitors of both class I and class II HDAC enhanced T(reg) suppression in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate tools for further analysis of T(reg) functions, and point to a critical role of class II HDAC in the regulation of T(regs). Such knowledge has direct implications for the development of in vivo approaches to treat autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases.",

Cobalt chloride and normal saline were given by intraperitoneal injection once per day for 3 weeks. The body weights of the mice were recorded every 3 days to ensure the correct doses of cobalt chloride. Blood samples for testing were taken at day 4, week 1, week 2 and week 3. Serum cobalt ion concentrations were measured in all samples whereas other serum biochemical variables, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and creatine kinase (CK) were evaluated at week 1, 2 and 3. After killing the mice at week 3, the heart, liver and kidney were collected for pathological evaluation.Serum cobalt ion concentration was different between the groups. High-dose cobalt chloride significantly increased AST, ALT and CK concentrations, the concentrations increasing in parallel with treatment duration. Pathological evaluation showed that high-dose cobalt chloride had toxic effects on the heart and liver; however no significant effect was apparent in the kidney.High-dose cobalt ion concentration in serum has toxic effects on the heart and liver, but no significant effect on the kidney in mice.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of present study was to evaluate the role of LISS after a large series of patients in whom a fracture around the knee had been treated with this uniform technique. Between April 2004 and September 2006, 210 patients with a total of 216 fractures around the knee were treated with LISS, all at the Affiliated Hospital to Nantong University. Patients were followed for a mean of 27 months (range 12-42 months). 26 patients were excluded from the study. The remaining 184 patients with a total of 189 fractures of either distal femur (85 cases) or proximal tibia (104 cases) were available for analysis. The mean age of these patients was 49 years (range 18-82 years). Immediate postoperative X-rays showed the alignment of bone and joint was satisfactorily maintained with LISS in all cases and an ideal implant position in 176 cases (93%). All cases healed the fracture without non-union. The mean time to union was 15 weeks (range 12-27 weeks) for the femoral and 16 weeks (range 12-27 weeks) for the tibia fractures. Functional assessment was performed using HSS (hospital for special surgery) score. At the time of the latest follow-up, 158 patients (86%) had an excellent or good outcome. Overall, 3 patients were subject to a salvage operative procedure due to implant failure. Three cases underwent secondary bone graft for open fractures. Superficial and deep infection was found each in one patient and both were treated successfully. Hardware prominence irritation was found in 2 patients. LISS was removed in 27 patients after bone healing, and this procedure was neither less invasive nor easy as imagined. The results indicate the LISS system is perfect but by no means unique in the treatment of the fractures around the knee. The fixation is adequate enough to maintain alignment and obtain union with a low incidence of complications even in patients with osteoporotic bone. We firmly believe favourable results can be achieved when this device is combined with correct indications as well as skillful techniques.",

        "abstract": "The multipotent and easily accessible characteristics of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) make them a promising target for bone tissue engineering. Long non\u2011coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an important role in the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Nevertheless, whether lncRNAs are involved in the osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs remains unclear. The present study examined the expression alterations of lncRNAs in tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 induced osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs. Following identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs at different time points by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction, profiling analysis was performed and a profile was further validated, in which lncRNA expression levels demonstrated significant upregulation. The next generation sequencing analysis identified 77 (58 upregulated and 19 downregulated) and 133 differentially expressed lncRNAs (73 upregulated and 60 downregulated) at 7\u00a0and\u00a014\u00a0days post\u2011treatment, respectively. In addition, 34 lncRNAs were predicted to be strongly associated with 336 mRNA transcripts that underwent significant alterations during osteogenic differentiation. The present data demonstrated that one lncRNA, X inactive specific transcript, is essential for efficient osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs by alkaline phosphatase staining. In summary, the present findings provide insight for the understanding of how non\u2011coding RNAs are involved in regulating the osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs, which may further advance the translational studies of bone tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Controversy persists concerning the preferred treatment of peritrochanteric femoral fractures. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the mid-term outcomes of the newly developed implants - proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) for the stabilisation of this type of fracture.Between April 2006 and March 2008, 169 patients with peritrochanteric femoral fractures were treated with PFNA. As many as 26 patients were excluded from the study. According to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) classification system, the remaining 143 fractures were classified as 19 cases of AO/OTA 31A1 fractures, 83 cases of 31A2 fractures, 28 cases of 31A3 fractures and 13 cases of 31A combined with proximal 32 fracture or separate proximal 32 fracture. The mean age of these patients was 67 years (range, 20-93 years). The operative time, the overall fluoroscopy time, the duration of hospitalisation and the surgical complications were noted. Patients were followed up for a mean of 21 months (range, 12-36 months). Functional outcomes were assessed according to the Harris hip scoring system.Fifteen patients (10%) required open reduction. The mean duration of surgery (from the beginning of close reduction to wound closure) was 72 min with a range between 45 and 170 min. The mean fluoroscopy time was 164 s with a range between 92 and 396 s. The mean time of hospital stay was 15 days. Postoperative X-rays showed a good or acceptable reduction in 134 cases (94%), and an ideal implant position in 131 cases (92%). There were 12 (8%) postoperative complications. All patients except one healed their fractures without any implant-specific complication (bending, breaking of the implant, cut out of the PFNA blade, femoral head penetration of the blade or ipsilateral fractures of the femoral shaft at the tip of the implant). The average time to bone healing was 16 weeks (range, 12-25 weeks). At the time of the latest follow-up, 106 patients (74%) were restored to their preoperative mobility. The mean Harris hip score was 84 points (range, 46-100 points). A total of 106 patients (74%) had an excellent or good outcome. According to the patients and/or their caregivers, outcome was described as satisfactory in 120(84%) of the 143 patients, and 36(90%) of the 40 patients, who were more than 80 years old.The results suggest that PFNA is a very effective and safe method in the treatment of different patterns of peritrochanteric femoral fractures. The fixation is adequate to maintain reduction over time even in osteoporotic bones.",

Samples from seven patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and eight healthy people were obtained as controls. Real-time PCR or western blot analysis was used to observe the expression of \u03b21,4-GalT-I and E-selectin. Cellular colocalization of \u03b21,4-GalT-I, galactose-containing glycans and other molecules was analyzed by double immunofluorescence.Expression of \u03b21,4-GalT-I and galactose-containing glycans increased in synovial tissue of RA patients compared with OA patients and healthy controls. Most galactose-containing glycans and \u03b21,4-GalT-I were expressed in inflammatory cells. E-selectin overexpressed and was correlated with galactose-containing glycans in RA synovial tissue.These results suggested that \u03b21,4-GalT-I may play an important role in the inflammatory processes in synovial tissue of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",

The perioperative data were recorded and compared in relation to fracture type.In each type of fractures, no significant differences were found with respect to the blood loss, the quality of reduction, the time to bony healing, and the Harris hip score between the 2 groups. The mean duration of surgery was significantly longer in reverse LISS group than in PFNA group.Both the PFNA and the reversed LISS are effective in the treatment of different types of intertrochanteric femur fractures. PFNA is superior to reverse LISS in terms of surgical time, weight-bearing, and perhaps fluoroscopy time.",

        "abstract": "Background: The anatomical morphology of the proximal end of the radius is an important factor restricting the treatment of fracture, design and improvement of internal fixator and prosthesis. Objective: To measure 19 anatomical parameters of the proximal end of the radius to provide references for reasonable placement of internal fixator, correct excision of radial head and improved design of prosthesis in treating radial proximal fractures. Design, time and setting: The repetitive measurement and contrast observation were performed at the Trauma Research Room, Hospital of Nantong University from December 2007 to April 2008. Materials: Thirty pairs of upper limb samples from adult antisepsis corpses were randomly selected, including 15 pairs from males and 15 pairs from females. Methods: These specimens were dissected to remove the radius and ulna. The anatomical parameters of the proximal end of the radius were measured with slide gaud (0.01 mm in precision), calipers and goniometer. Main outcome measures: Angles related to the proximal end of the radius: the axis of the radial neck and diaphysis, the range of contact of radians between the articular circumference and the ulnar and radial notch at the neutral position, the maximum range of pronation of the forearm, the maximum range of supination of the forearm, and the range of non-contact of radian; Results of height, length, transverse and sagittal diameters related to the proximal end of the radius: the length of the proximal end of the radius, the medial height of the articular circumference, the lateral height of the articular circumference, the anterior height of the articular circumference, the posterior height of the articular circumference, the maximum depth of the fovea of radial head, the length of the lateral arc of the proximal end of the radius, the maximum vertical height of the lateral arc, the transverse diameter of the radial neck above radial tuberosity, the distance between the proximal end of radial head and the superior border of radial tuberosity, the distance between the proximal end of radial head and the middle of radial tuberosity, the transverse diameter of radial head, the sagittal diameter of radial head, and the diameter of the fovea of radial head. Results: There were no significant differences between males and females in terms of angles related to the proximal end of the radius (P > 0.05). The measurement results of height, length, transverse and sagittal diameters related to the proximal end of the radius in males were significantly larger than in females (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In the treatment of radial proximal fractures, the anatomical parameters of the proximal end of the radius should be considered in performing excision of radial head, internal fixation and prosthesis replacement. Because the parameters of males are larger than females, the prosthesis size should be changed.",

We previously reported, for the first time, that \u03b21,4-GalT-I may play an important role in the inflammatory processes in synovial tissue of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we analyzed whether \u03b21,4-GalT-I expression correlates with the expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in RA. We show firstly the overexpression and co-localization of \u03b21,4-GalT-I and TNF-\u03b1 in synovial tissue of RA patients. Then, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces \u03b21,4-GalT-I mRNA up-regulation in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) through endogenous TNF-\u03b1 overexpression. In addition, we observed that not only endogenous TNF-\u03b1 but also exogenous TNF-\u03b1 induced \u03b21,4-GalT-I mRNA production in FLSs, and TNF-\u03b1-knockdown reverses the up-regulation of \u03b21,4-GalT-I in FLSs induced by LPS or TNF-\u03b1.

The proposed method is based on a minimization of path cost between two regions, defined as the integral of local costs that are derived from the full tensor data along the path. We solve the minimal path problem using a Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the problem and a new, fast iterative method that computes updates on the propagating front of the cost function at every point. The solutions for the fronts emanating from the two initial regions are combined, giving a voxel-wise connectivity measurement of the optimal paths between the regions that pass through those voxels. The resulting high-connectivity voxels provide a volumetric representation of the white matter pathway between the terminal regions. We quantify the tensor data along these pathways using nonparametric regression of the tensors and of derived measures as a function of path length. In this way we can obtain volumetric measures on white-matter tracts between regions without any explicit integration of tracts. We demonstrate the proposed method on several fiber tracts from DT-MRI data of the normal human brain.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for correcting the geometric and greyscale distortions in diffusion-weighted MRI that result from inhomogeneities in the static magnetic field. These inhomogeneities may due to imperfections in the magnet or to spatial variations in the magnetic susceptibility of the object being imaged--so called susceptibility artifacts. Echo-planar imaging (EPI), used in virtually all diffusion weighted acquisition protocols, assumes a homogeneous static field, which generally does not hold for head MRI. The resulting distortions are significant, sometimes more than ten millimeters. These artifacts impede accurate alignment of diffusion images with structural MRI, and are generally considered an obstacle to the joint analysis of connectivity and structure in head MRI. In principle, susceptibility artifacts can be corrected by acquiring (and applying) a field map. However, as shown in the literature and demonstrated in this paper, field map corrections of susceptibility artifacts are not entirely accurate and reliable, and thus field maps do not produce reliable alignment of EPIs with corresponding structural images. This paper presents a new, image-based method for correcting susceptibility artifacts. The method relies on a variational formulation of the match between an EPI baseline image and a corresponding T2-weighted structural image but also specifically accounts for the physics of susceptibility artifacts. We derive a set of partial differential equations associated with the optimization, describe the numerical methods for solving these equations, and present results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with field-map correction.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a method to compute and visualize volumetric white matter connectivity in diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) using a Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) solver on the GPU (graphics processing unit). Paths through the volume are assigned costs that are lower if they are consistent with the preferred diffusion directions. The proposed method finds a set of voxels in the DTI volume that contain paths between two regions whose costs are within a threshold of the optimal path. The result is a volumetric optimal path analysis, which is driven by clinical and scientific questions relating to the connectivity between various known anatomical regions of the brain. To solve the minimal path problem quickly, we introduce a novel numerical algorithm for solving H-J equations, which we call the fast iterative method (FIM). This algorithm is well-adapted to parallel architectures, and we present a GPU-based implementation, which runs roughly 50-100 times faster than traditional CPU-based solvers for anisotropic H-J equations. The proposed system allows users to freely change the endpoints of interesting pathways and to visualize the optimal volumetric path between them at an interactive rate. We demonstrate the proposed method on some synthetic and real DT-MRI datasets and compare the performance with existing methods.",

The present study was carried out to explore the modified culture medium for SGECs in vitro. Full-thickness skin samples were minced (1 mm(3)) and digested overnight with type II collagenase. The gland coils were removed under an inverted phase-contrast microscope. An adherent culture method was used to isolate and culture SGECs. Staining with hematoxylin and eosin was performed, followed by observation of the morphologic features of these cells. Immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to cytokeratins CK7, CK18, and CK19 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was performed to verify the presence of SGECs. Growth curves by MTT were created for cells grown in serum-free keratinocyte medium and in modified keratinocyte medium containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). One week after culturing, the cells grew well and were polygonal or irregular in shape by inverted phase contrast microscopy. Cell fusion, with a characteristic paving-stone arrangement, reached 100% after approximately 3 weeks in culture. Immunofluorescence staining indicated expression of CK7, CK18, CK19, and CEA. Compared with SGECs grown in serum-free keratinocyte medium, the proliferation of SGECs grown in modified culture medium with low concentration of FBS at days 6, 9, and 12 was significantly accelerated (p < 0.05). This study suggests that keratinocyte medium supplemented with 2.5% FBS is effective and suitable for the culture of SGECs.",

        "abstract": "Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) are considered to be an ideal replacement for bone marrow MSCs. However, up to date, there is no convenient and efficient method for hUCMSC isolation and culture. The present study was carried out to explore the modified enzyme digestion for hUCMSC in vitro. Conventional enzyme digestion, modified enzyme digestion, and tissue explant were used on hUCMSCs to compare their efficiencies of isolation and culture, to observe primary cell growth and cell subculture. The results show that the cells cultured using the tissue explant method had a longer culture cycle (P < 0.01) and lower yield of primary cells per centimetre of umbilical cord (P < 0.01) compared with the two enzyme digestion methods. Subculture adherence and cell doubling took significantly less time with the tissue explant method (P < 0.05) than with the conventional enzyme digestion method; however, there was no significant difference between the tissue explant method and the modified enzyme digestion method (P > 0.05). Comparing two enzyme digestion methods, the modified method yielded more cells than did the conventional method (P < 0.01), and primary cell adherence took significantly less time with the modified method than with the conventional method (P < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis of the third-generation hUCMSCs cultured by modified enzyme digestion method indicated that most cells were quiescent. Immunofluorescence staining showed that these cells expressed MSC markers CD44 and CD90. And Von Kossa and oil red O staining detection showed that they could be differentiated into osteoblasts and adipocytes with induction medium in vitro. This study suggests that hUCMSC isolation and culture using 0.2 % collagenase II at 37 \u00b0C for digestion of 16-20 h is an effective and simple modified enzyme digestion method.",

However, optimal modes for preparation of microencapsulate stem cells need to be improved, and expression and release of products of microencapsulated gene modified stem cells need to be studied in vitro.To explore the optimal parameters when preparing microencapsulated stem cells, and to investigate the effect of microencapsulation on growth, secretion, and metabolism of genetically modified human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hUCMSCs).In this study, the parameters of preparation were regulated by observing the microcapsule shape and size. Live/dead cell viability kits and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextrans (FD) were used to detect the microencapsulated cell viability, and the permeability of microcapsules, respectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in the supernatant of microencapsulated and non-microencapsulated VEGF gene-modified hUCMSCs cultures was measured by ELISA.The optimal parameters of preparing microcapsules were regulated as followed: bolus velocity was 6 ml/h, and airflow velocity was 3 L/min. The morphology of microcapsules was a spherical structure with a diameter of 450 \u00b1 30 \u00b5m. More than 90% of the cells were viable after 21 days of culture. Low and middle molecular weight FD was able to pass through the microcapsules; however, high molecular weight FD was not. Also, the VEGF concentration in microencapsulated and non-microencapsulated cell culture supernatants exhibited no significant difference at each time point.Microencapsulated stem cells can be ideally prepared via specifically regulated preparation. Lastly, microencapsulation does not alter growth, secretion, and metabolism of the genetically modified hUCMSCs.",

        "abstract": "Tissue-engineered dermis (TED) is thought to be the best treatment for skin defect wounds; however, lack of vascular structures in these products can cause slow vascularization or even transplant failure. We assessed the therapeutic potential of microencapsulated human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (hUCMSCs) expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vascularization of TED.hUCMSCs were isolated by means of enzymatic digestion and identified by means of testing biological characteristics. hUCMSCs were induced to differentiate into dermal fibroblasts in conditioned induction media. Collagen-chitosan laser drilling acellular dermal matrix (ADM) composite scaffold was prepared by means of the freeze dehydration and dehydrothermal cross-linking method. hUCMSC-derived fibroblasts were implanted on composite scaffolds to construct TED. TED with microencapsulated VEGF gene-modified hUCMSCs was then transplanted into skin defect wounds in pigs. The angiogenesis of TED at 1 week and status of wound healing at 3 weeks were observed.The collagen-chitosan laser ADM composite has a uniform microporous structure. This composite has been used to grow hUCMSC-derived fibroblasts in vitro and to successfully construct stem cell-derived TED. Microencapsulated VEGF gene-modified hUCMSCs were prepared with the use of a sodium alginate-barium chloride one-step encapsulation technology. Seven days after the transplantation of the stem cell-derived TED and microencapsulated VEGF gene-modified hUCMSCs into the skin defect wounds on the backs of miniature pigs, the VEGF expression increased and the TED had a higher degree of vascularization. Re-epithelialization of the wound was completed after 3 weeks.Microencapsulated VEGF gene-modified hUCMSCs can effectively improve the vascularization of TED and consequently the quality of wound healing.",

UCMSCs are considered to be a promising source of stem cells in regenerative medicine. In this study, we collected newborn umbilical cord tissue under sterile conditions and isolated UCMSCs through a tissue attachment method. UCMSC cell surface markers were examined using flow cytometry. On the third passage, UCMSCs were induced to differentiate into dermal fibroblasts in conditioned induction media. The induction results were detected using immunofluorescence with a fibroblast-specific monoclonal antibody and real time PCR for type I and type III collagen. UCMSCs exhibited a fibroblast-like morphology and reached 90% confluency 14 to 18 days after primary culture. Cultured UCMSCs showed strong positive staining for CD73, CD29, CD44, CD105, and HLA-I, but not CD34, CD45, CD31, or HLA-DR. After differentiation, immunostaining for collagen type I, type III, fibroblast-specific protein, vimentin, and desmin were all strongly positive in induced cells, and staining was weak or negative in non-induced cells; total transcript production of collagen type I and collagen type III mRNA was higher in induced cells than in non-induced cells. These results demonstrate that UCMSCs can be induced to differentiate into fibroblasts with conditioned induction media and, in turn, could be used as seed cells for tissue-engineered dermis.",

However, the precise origin of LSCs remains unclear. Herein we determine if bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from rats in acute hepatic failure (AHF) possess hepatic characteristics and have differentiation potential. BMSCs were isolated from AHF and sham-operated rats, and primary hepatocytes were isolated from normal rats for comparison. The transcriptomic profile of BMSCs and primary hepatocytes was analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array. BMSCs isolated from AHF and normal rats were induced to differentiate into hepatocytes in vitro and the degree of hepatic differentiation was assessed using quantitative real time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and biochemical assays. AHF-derived BMSCs had a significantly different gene expression profile compared to control BMSCs. Thirty-four gene/probe sets were expressed in both AHF-derived BMSCs and primary hepatocytes, but were absent in control-derived BMSCs, including 3 hepatocyte-specific genes. Forty-four genes were up-regulated more than 2-fold in AHF-derived BMSCs compared to controls, including 3 genes involved in hepatocyte metabolism and development. Furthermore, AHF-derived BMSCs expressed more hepatocyte related genes than control BMSCs. Additional experiments to validate the differentiation of AHF-derived BMSCs, compared to control-derived BMSCs, showed that several hepatocyte-specific genes and proteins [such as albumin (ALB) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP)] were expressed earlier, and at higher levels, after 1 week of differentiation. Hepatocyte-specific metabolic functions were also significantly higher in the AHF group compared to control cells.AHF-derived BMSCs had a hepatic transcriptional profile and expressed hepatocyte specific genes early during differentiation, and possessed greater hepatogenic potency in vitro compared to cells isolated from control animals, further confirming their potential as a stem cell-based therapy for end-stage liver disease.",

In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) bioscaffold was introduced for differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into hepatocytes. For hepatocyte differentiation, third passage BMSCs isolated from normal adult F344 rats were seeded into collagen-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (C-PLGA) 3D scaffolds with hepatocyte differentiation medium for 3 weeks. Hepatogenesis in scaffolds was characterized by reverse transcript PCR, western blot, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), periodic acid-Schiff staining, histochemistry, and biochemical assays with hepatic-specific genes and markers. A monolayer culture system was used as a control differentiation group. The results showed that isolated cells possessed the basic features of BMSCs. Differentiated hepatocyte-like cells in C-PLGA scaffolds expressed hepatocyte-specific markers [eg, albumin (ALB), alpha-fetoprotein, cytokeratin 18, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha, and cytochrome P450] at mRNA and protein levels. Most markers were expressed in C-PLGA group 1 week earlier than in the control group. Results of biocompatibility indicated that the differentiated hepatocyte-like cells grew more stably in C-PLGA scaffolds than that in controls during a 3-week differentiation period. The significantly higher metabolic functions in hepatocyte-like cells in the C-PLGA scaffold group further demonstrated the important role of the scaffold.As the phenomenon of transdifferentiation is uncommon, our successful transdifferentiation rates of BMSCs to mature hepatocytes prove the superiority of the C-PLGA scaffold in providing a suitable environment for such a differentiation. This material can possibly be used as a bioscaffold for liver tissue engineering in future clinical therapeutic applications.",

        "abstract": "With the development of high-throughput screening, a variety of genetic alterations has been found in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although previous studies on HCC methylation profiles have focused on liver tissue, studies using isolated hepatocytes are rare. The heterogeneity of liver composition may impact the genuine methylation status of HCC; therefore, it is important to clarify the methylation profile of hepatocytes to aid in understanding the process of tumorigenesis.The global methylation profile of single hepatocytes isolated from liver tissue of hepatitis B virus (HBV) related HCC (HBHC) was analyzed using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChips, and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and bisulfite sequencing were used to validate the 20 significant hypermethylated genes identified. In this study, we found many noteworthy differences in the genome-wide methylation profiles of single hepatocytes of HBHC. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis showed that hepatocyte methylation profiles could be classified according to three cell types: hepatocytes of HCC, adjacent hepatocytes and normal hepatocytes. Among the 20 most hypermethylated genes in the hepatocytes of HBHC, 7 novel genes (WNK2, EMILIN2, TLX3, TM6SF1, TRIM58, HIST1H4Fand GRASP) were found to be hypermethylated in HBHC and hypomethylated in paired adjacent liver tissues; these findings have not been reported in previous studies on tissue samples.The genome-wide methylation profile of purified single hepatocytes of HBHC was aided in understanding the process of tumorigenesis, and a series of novel methylated genes found in this study have the potential to be biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of HBHC.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) transplantation is a promising alternative to liver transplantation for patients with end-stage liver disease. However, the precise origin of HPCs is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from rats in acute hepatic failure (AHF) possess hepatic potential and/or characteristics. BMSCs were isolated from normal rats as well as rats in which AHF was induced by D-galactosamine. HPCs and primary hepatocytes were isolated from normal rats for comparison. The Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array was used to perform transcriptome profiling of the AHF-derived BMSCs and HPCs. The results showed that AHF-derived BMSCs had a gene expression profile significantly different from that of control BMSCs. More than 87.7% of the genes/probe sets that were upregulated more than 2-fold in AHF-derived BMSCs were expressed by HPCs, including 12 genes involved in liver development, early hepatocyte differentiation and hepatocyte metabolism. Confirmatory quantitative RT-PCR analysis yielded similar results. In addition, 940 probe sets/genes were expressed in both AHF-derived BMSCs and HPCs but were absent in control cells. Compared to the control cells, AHF-derived BMSCs shared more commonly expressed genes with HPCs. AHF-derived BMSCs have a hepatic transcriptional profile and express many of the same genes expressed by HPCs, strongly suggesting that BMSCs may be a resource for hepatocyte regeneration, and further confirming their potential as a strong source of hepatocyte regeneration during severe hepatic damage.",

The presence of integrons (class 1 and 2) was frequently observed (82.3%) while no class 3 integron was found. In these integrons, 21 resistance genes of 14 gene cassette arrays and 10 different families of resistance genes were identified. Three gene cassette arrays, aac(6')-Ib-cr-aar-3-dfrA27-aadA16, aacA4-catB3-dfrA1 and aadA2-lnuF, were detected for the first time in surface water. The results showed that bacterial resistance in the catchment was seriously influenced by human activities, especially discharge of wastewater.",

The Enterobacteriaceae isolates were tested for susceptibility to seven antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, tetracycline and trimethoprim. In Liuxi reservoir, with an exception to ampicillin resistant strains (11%) no other antibiotic resistance bacterial strains were detected. However, multiple drug resistance in bacterial isolates from the other sites of Pearl rivers was observed which is possibly due to sewage discharge and input from other anthropogenic sources along the rivers. Four tetracycline resistance genes tet A, tet B, tet C and tet D were detected in the isolates from the rivers. The genes tet A and tet B were widely detected with the detection frequencies of 43% and 40% respectively. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin resistant enteric bacteria were also isolated from the pig and duck manures which suggest a wider distribution of human specific drugs in the environment. This investigation provided a baseline data on antibiotic resistance profiles and tetracycline resistance genes in the Pearl rivers delta.",

Compared to the sterile control, the degradation rates of norfloxacin in the non-sterile soil were greatly enhanced, suggesting that microorganisms played a major role in the degradation. Accelerated degradation for norfloxacin in the soil was observed with decreasing concentrations (30 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg) with its half-life decreasing from 62 days to 31 days. Amending swine manure into the soil and increasing the soil moisture level enhanced the biological degradation of norfloxacin. No obvious inhibition of norfloxacin on soil respiration was observed in the soil, while only slight effect on nitrogen transformation was found. The results suggested that norfloxacin at the reported environmental concentrations (<100 mg/kg) would have little effect on microbial activity and functions in the soils.",

The results showed that 98.4% of the isolates (1056) were found resistant to antibiotic(s) tested and 90.6% showed multiple resistances to at least three antibiotics. Tetracycline was found to have the highest resistance frequency (70.8%), followed by ampicillin (65.1%), whereas ceftazidime had the lowest resistance frequency of 9.0%. Moreover, 39.2% of the E. coli isolates were carrying plasmids. intI1 had the highest detection rate in the plasmids (38.1%), followed by qnrS, ampC, qnrB, intI2 and aac(6')-Ib-cr. The disinfection process (UV and chlorination) could significantly reduce the number of bacteria, but percentage of the resistant bacteria, resistance frequency for each antibiotic, MAR index and detection rate of the plasmid-mediated resistance genes were all found increasing in the effluents of biological units. The results of this study showed that a more frequent horizontal gene transfer occurred in the biological units.

The phytotoxic effects varied between the antibiotics and between plant species (sweet oat, rice and cucumber). Rice was most sensitive to sulfamethoxazole with the EC10 value of 0.1 mg/L. The antibiotics tested inhibited soil phosphatase activity during the 22 days' incubation. Significant effects on soil respiration were found for the two sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine) and trimethoprim, whereas little effects were observed for the two tetracyclines and tylosin. The effective concentrations (EC10 values) for soil respiration in the first 2 days were 7 mg/kg for sulfamethoxazole, 13 mg/kg for sulfamethazine and 20 mg/kg for trimethoprim. Antibiotic residues in manure and soils may affect soil microbial and enzyme activities.",

The antibiotics in the sediment were extracted by using an optimized mixed solution (citric buffer: acetonitrile, 50:50 v/v), and analyzed by rapid resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS) equipped with electrospray ionization source in the positive mode. The recoveries for the antibiotics in the spiked sediment were: 66.3-123.5%, 48.2-72.0%, 61.8-160.4% and 60.6-151.9% for the SAs, TCs, FQs and MLs, respectively. The LOD ranged from 0.08 microg/kg to 4.2 microg/kg and LOQ from 0.26 microg/kg (erythromycin-H(2)O) to 14.01 microg/kg (norfloxacin). The developed analytical method was applied in the determination of the antibiotics in sediment samples collected from the Pearl Rivers, China. The antibiotics were found at the levels of microg/kg in the sediments of the three rivers. Ofloxacin was found to have the highest concentration of 1560 microg/kg in sediment. However, no significant seasonal variation could be found for the antibiotics in the sediments between wet season and dry season.",

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have the highest inhibition rates among all the antibiotics. In early incubation period (0-2 d), the concentrations above 10 mg\u00b7kg-1 of sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim remarkably decrease soil CO2 emission. The effects of these antibiotics vary with their concentrations too. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim show good dose-response relationships.

        "abstract": "Antibiotics are still widely applied in animal husbandry to prevent diseases and used as feed additives to promote animal growth. This could result in antibiotic resistance to bacteria and antibiotic residues in animals. In this paper, Enterobacteriaceae isolated from four integrated fish farms in Zhongshan, South China were tested for antibiotic resistance, tetracycline resistance genes, sulfonamide resistance genes, and class 1 integrons. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were carried out to test antibiotic susceptibility and resistance genes, respectively. Relatively high antibiotic resistance frequencies were found, especially for ampicillin (80%), tetracycline (52%), and trimethoprim (50%). Out of 203 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 98.5% were resistant to one or more antibiotics tested. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) was found highest in animal manures with a MAR index of 0.56. Tetracycline resistance genes (tet(A), tet(C)) and sulfonamide resistance genes (sul2) were detected in more than 50% of the isolates. The intI1 gene was found in 170 isolates (83.7%). Both classic and non-classic class 1 integrons were found. Four genes, aadA5, aadA22, dfr2, and dfrA17, were detected. To our knowledge, this is the first report for molecular characterization of antibiotic resistance genes in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from integrated fish farms in China and the first time that gene cassette array dfrA17-aadA5 has been detected in such fish farms. Results of this study indicated that fish farms may be a reservoir of highly diverse and abundant antibiotic resistant genes and gene cassettes. Integrons may play a key role in multiple antibiotic resistances posing potential health risks to the general public and aquaculture.",

The xenoestrogens 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-nonylphenol and bisphenol A were detected at almost every sampling site at concentrations of several ng L(-1) (ng g(-1)) to tens of \u03bcg L(-1) (\u03bcg g(-1)) in surface waters (and sediments). The estrogens estrone and 17\u03b2-estradiol were also detected in most of the samples with concentrations from several ng L(-1) (ng g(-1)) to tens of ng L(-1) (ng g(-1)) in surface waters (and sediments). However, synthetic estrogens diethylstilbestrol and 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol were only detected at a few sites. The 17\u03b2-estradiol equivalents (EEQ) screened by the YES bioassay were in the range of 0.23-324 ng L(-1) in surface waters and from not detected to 101 ng g(-1) in sediments. Shijing River displayed one to two orders of magnitude higher levels for both measured chemical concentrations and estrogenic activities than the Zhujiang River and the Liuxi River. A risk assessment for the surface waters showed high risks for the downstream reaches of the Liuxi River and the upstream to midstream reaches of the Zhujiang River and the Shijing River. Higher estrogenic risks were observed in the wet season than in the dry season for surface waters, probably due to the input of runoff and direct overflow of small urban streams during heavy rain events. Only small variations in estrogenic risk were found for the sediments between the two seasons, suggesting that sediments are a sink for these estrogenic compounds in the rivers.",

We investigated the occurrence of twelve acidic pharmaceuticals and herbicides (salicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, fenoprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, diclofenac, meclofenamic acid and indomethacin) in surface waters of the Yellow River, Hai River and Liao River in north China during the wet and dry seasons and assessed the potential risks to aquatic organisms posed by these acidic compounds. Seven acidic compounds were detected in the rivers, including five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, mefenamic acid and naproxen), and two blood lipid regulators (clofibric acid and gemfibrozil). The concentrations for acidic pharmaceuticals in the Yellow River and Liao River were in most cases higher in the dry season than in the wet season, but the concentrations of acidic compounds in the Hai River were generally higher in July than in November. High concentrations of these detected compounds in the Yellow River, Hai River and Liao River were found more frequently at those sites located in metropolitan areas, lower reaches or river confluences. Only diclofenac and ibuprofen were found to have medium to high risks in the three rivers based on the calculated risk quotients.",

The estrogenic compounds 4-t-OP, 4-NP, BPA, E1, E2 and TCS were detected in most of the samples, with their concentrations up to 52.1 2065.7, 755.6, 55.8, 7.4 and 81.3 ng/L in water, and up to 8.6, 558.4, 33.8, 7.9, <LOQ and 33.9 ng/g in sediment, respectively. However, DES and EE2 were not detected in the Liao River. The estrogen equivalents (EEQ) of the water and sediment samples were also measured by the bioassay. High estrogenic risks to aquatic organisms were found in the river sections of metropolitan areas and the lower reach of the river system.",

At the spike concentration of 10 mg/kg, the half-lives for sulfadiazine in the aerobic nonsterile soils ranged from 12 days to 18 days. Sulfadiazine was more persistent in the anoxic soils with the half-lives ranging between 57 days and 237 days and soil microorganisms played little role in the dissipation process under anoxic conditions. The decline in sulfadiazine concentrations was also observed in the sterile soils under aerobic conditions. Hydrolysis could not explain this phenomena as hydrolysis of sulfadiazine was pH dependent. Sulfadiazine only hydrolyzed to a very limited degree at acidic pH. Increased sorption was observed for sulfadiazine in soil 1 (pH 4.3) when the contact time increased to 14 days, but no significant increase in sorption was found for soil 2 (pH 7.2) and soil 3 (pH 8.5).",

(Testing for multiple bubbles: historical episodes of exuberance and collapse in the S&P 500. Singapore Management University, Working Paper, No. 04-2013, 2013). The results show that there are six explosive bubbles in China and five bubbles in U.S. market, mostly occur in the period of huge surges in Bitcoin price. This is consistent with the bubble model originated by Blanchard and Watson (Bubbles, rational expectations and financial markets. NBER Working Paper, No. 945 1982) that certain asset price is decomposed into fundamental and the bubble components. In particular, exogenous shocks, including foreign or domestic economic events lead to the origination of bubbles. Serious financial crisis may trigger long-term and large- scale bubbles, while relative not persistence (short-term) bubbles are caused by domestic particular components. It can be inferred that Bitcoin can be used as a hedge against market specific risk. Finally, Bitcoin bubbles would collapse due to the administrative intervention by economic authorities. Thereby, government should lead public expectation to keep the confidence to authority and reduce the speculation behavior to stabilize the asset price and financial market.",

        "abstract": "This study explores whether the female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) can promote economic development in Asian countries. We apply the method of bootstrap panel Granger causality in order to consider the cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity to detect specific patterns of the interactive relationships between the two variables. The estimation results point out that the interaction patterns vary across countries, which is consistent with the U-shaped hypothesis. Specifically, when the economy develops, FLFPR declines in Vietnam and India, whereas economic development promotes the FLFPR in Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. More specifically, when GDP per capita lies at a relatively low level, the income effect dominates the substitution effect, resulting into the FLFPR changing in opposite direction. Nevertheless, the substitution effect holds the dominant position when the GDP per capita reaches a high level. The increase of FLFPR is accompanied by economic development due to availability of more jobs and increasing level of education. Therefore, policy makers should formulate plans in order to benefit from the potential of the female labor force by stimulating economic development.",

This method provides an insight into the dynamic nexus in both time and frequency domains. In general, Empirical results show that there is a positive relationship between the two series in China, although it varies across time and frequencies. First, we find that disposable income is the core factor which affects both consumption and housing prices in China. Second, housing prices have a weak wealth effect on consumption in most time. High housing ownership and proportion of housing asset in the total household asset lead to a wealth effect of housing prices on consumption. Third, in the long term, there is a significant wealth effect of housing prices on consumption, but it weakens after 2008, which implies that excessively high housing prices in recent years have partially constrained residents' consumption. These findings have important implications for seeking housing market regulation and expanding domestic consumption decisions.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines whether broader money supply (M2) and interest rate as two monetary policy tools may have differently affected housing prices in China. Empirical results show that there is a co-movement between housing prices and M2 in the short run and it becomes more pronounced after 2006 in the medium run. In addition, generally M2 positively affects housing prices. This supports the asset price channel which indicates that an easing monetary policy offers ample liquidity and results in raising the housing prices. The excess liquidity after 2008 spread to housing market, resulting in too much money chasing relatively few assets and triggering a surge in housing prices. On the other hand, we observe that co-movement between housing prices and interest rate is not very evident in most time. Moreover, we find that interest rate has a positive effect on housing prices which is not consistent with the user cost approach and indicates that a contracting monetary policy is not effective in curbing housing...",

        "abstract": "This study investigates whether bubbles exist in Bitcoin markets and tracks when they will occur and collapse. We apply the generalized sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller test method proposed by Phillips et al. (2013). The results show that there have been four explosive bubbles in China and the U.S. market, primarily occurring during the periods of huge surges in Bitcoin prices. This is consistent with the bubble model improved by Gurkaynak (2008), in which asset price is decomposed into fundamental and bubble components. In particular, exogenous shocks, including foreign or domestic economic events, lead to the origination of bubbles. A serious financial crisis may trigger long-term and large-scale bubbles, whereas relatively short-term bubbles are caused by domestic components. It can be inferred that Bitcoin can be used as a hedge against market-specific risk. Finally, Bitcoin bubbles collapse due to administrative intervention by economic authorities. Therefore, the government should manage public expectations to maintain confidence in authority and reduce speculation behavior to stabilize the asset price and financial market.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study explores the causality between housing prices and money supply in order to support the dynamic equilibrium model in China. Considering structural changes, the long-run nexus using full-sample data is found to be unstable, suggesting the causality test is not reliable. Instead a time-varying rolling-window approach is employed to revisit the dynamic causal relationship. The results highlight the existence of a bidirectional causal link between housing prices and money supply in China. Specifically, soar and crash of housing prices manifest both positive and negative impacts on money supply in different sub-periods. In turn, money supply has a positive impact on housing prices, which supports the dynamic equilibrium model. In order to support a relatively stable housing price level, especially during structural economic changes, it is critical to facilitate the pegged money supply precautionary control and insure a reasonable and stable level of money supply into the real estate market.",

Empirical results show that HPs Granger cause GDP in the eastern region and in most provinces of the central region. Rapid industrialization and urbanization in the eastern region and the low-cost advantages of the central region promote housing investment and significantly affect GDP. However, GDP has no influence on HPs in the eastern region due to insufficient land supply, housing speculation and HPs deviating from the economic fundamentals. HPs do not Granger cause GDP in the western region because it is less attractive for housing investment. Also, GDP Granger causes HPs in the central and western regions\u00a0that the economy can influence HPs. These findings could help the government formulate reasonable regional policies for the development of the housing market and economic growth.",

By conducting a nationwide village-level survey, we find that these organizations are playing an important role in the provision of local public goods and services. To explain villagers' participation rates in these organizations, we specify and estimate two simultaneous equations and find that the level of villagers' distrust in township leaders exerts a significant and positive influence on the participation rates. We argue that, when distrusting local government officials, largely for their unwillingness or inability to provide public goods and services, villagers might attempt to participate in autonomous social organizations to serve their own and community's interests independently from the local Party-state. We also find that lineage structure and relations and labor out-migration have significant impacts on villagers' participation in such social organizations.

        "abstract": "A 3D multi-time scale discrete element method-computational fluid dynamic (DEM-CFD) coupling approach was applied to investigate the filtration of micron-sized particles by different types of fiber arrays. Both the pressure drop and the filtration efficiency were examined to indicate the filtration performance of the fiber arrays. Fibers that were uniformly arrayed in a parallel or staggered manner were compared. Results showed that the staggered array showed a better performance than the parallel array in terms of both pressure drop and filtration efficiency. Further, we compared the performance of different staggered arrays, i.e. a regular case, one densified in the front layers and another densified in the back layers. The front densified array was found to enter the clogging and cake filtration stage in the shortest time, leading to the highest filtration efficiency, but the highest pressure drop. The back densified array still achieved a much higher filtration efficiency, despite a much lower pressure drop comparable to that of the regular array. The results suggest that the two kinds of densified arrays may be suited for different purposes, e.g. baghouse filters or breathing masks.",

The cations investigated include 1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-3-methylimidazolium ([CyhmC1im](+)), 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium ([BnzC1im](+)), 1,3-dibenzylimidazolium ([(Bnz)2im](+)), and 1-(2-naphthylmethyl)-3-methylimidazolium ([NapmC1im](+)). Rheological properties are reported from terminal flow to the glassy state. All ionic liquids show very similar flow behavior with a glassy modulus approaching 1 GPa. The temperature dependences of the shift factors used for time-temperature superposition and the viscosity both follow the same VFT or WLF relationship, and the dynamic fragility at Tg ranges from 117 to 130 for the aromatic ionic liquids investigated, considerably more fragile, in the Angell sense, than the aliphatic analogs. Additionally, an anomalous aging effect in the dynamic viscosity response (i.e., a maximum observed at intermediate frequencies) was found using a strain-controlled rheometer but not using a stress-controlled rheometer.

        "abstract": "Roma Plastilina No. 1 (RP1), an artist modeling clay that has been used as a ballistic clay, is essential for evaluation and certification in standards-based ballistic resistance testing of body armor. It serves as a ballistic witness material (BWM) behind the armor, where the magnitude of the plastic deformation in the clay after a ballistic impact is the figure of merit (known as \"backface signature\"). RP1 is known to exhibit complex thermomechanical behavior that requires temperature conditioning and frequent performance-based evaluations to verify that its deformation response satisfies requirements. A less complex BWM formulation that allows for room-temperature storage and use as well as a more consistent thermomechanical behavior than RP1 is desired, but a validation based only on ballistic performance would be extensive and expensive to accommodate the different ballistic threats. A framework of lab-scale metrologies for measuring the effects of strain, strain rate, and temperature dependence on mechanical properties are needed to guide BWM development. The current work deals with rheological characterization of a candidate BWM, i.e., silicone composite backing material (SCBM), to understand the fundamental structure\u207bproperty relationships in comparison to those of RP1. Small-amplitude oscillatory shear frequency sweep experiments were performed at temperatures that ranged from 20 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C to map elastic and damping contributions in the linear elastic regime. Large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) experiments were conducted in the non-linear region and the material response was analyzed in the form of Lissajous curve representations with the values of perfect plastic dissipation ratio reported to identify the degree of plasticity. The results show that the SCBM exhibits dynamic properties that are similar in magnitude to those of temperature-conditioned RP1, but with minimal temperature sensitivity and weaker frequency dependence than RP1. Both SCBM and RP1 are identified as elastoviscoplastic materials, which is particularly important for accurate determination of backface signature in body armor evaluation. The mechanical properties of SCBM show some degree of aging and work history effects. The results from this work demonstrate that the rheological properties of SCBM, at small and large strains, are similar to RP1 with substantial improvements in BWM performance requirements in terms of temperature sensitivity and thixotropy.",

It has been identified recently as a topological superconductor (TSC) with an extraordinary nematic, i. e. C2-symmetric, superconducting state and odd-parity pairing. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we directly examine the response of the superconductivity of CuxBi2Se3 to magnetic field. Under out- of-plane (c-axis) fields, we discover elongated magnetic vortices hosting zero-bias conductance peaks consistent with the Majorana bound states expected in a TSC. Under in-plane (ab-plane) fields, the average superconducting gap exhibits two-fold symmetry with field orientation, the long C2 symmetry axes are pinned to the dihedral mirror planes under B//=0.5 T but slightly rotate under B//=1.0 T. Moreover, the intrinsic C2-symmetric gap distribution in momentum space is semi-quantitatively determined for the first time. Our data paint a microscopic picture of the nematic superconductivity in CuxBi2Se3 and pose strong constraints on theory.",

It is thus a novel nematic state, distinct from the nematicity of undoped/lightly-doped FeSCs which breaks the (\u03c0, 0)/(0, \u03c0) equivalence. Moreover, we observe a clear V-shaped superconducting gap. The gap is suppressed on surface Rb vacancies and step edges, and the suppression is particularly strong at the [110]-oriented edges. This is possibly due to a [Formula: see text] like pairing component with nodes along the [110] directions. Our results thus highlight the intimate connection between nematicity and superconducting pairing in iron-based superconductors.",

        "abstract": "We have previously reported that a newly synthesized compound, GL-V9 could induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in HepG2 cells. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood yet. In current study, we further showed that GL-V9 exhibited significant inhibitory effect on growth of several hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, GL-V9-induced growth inhibition was coincident with the strong upregulation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 (NAG-1), a TGF\u03b2 superfamily member, which has been linked with tumor suppression. Further analysis uncovered that GL-V9-activated p38 MAPK pathway contributed to enhancement of NAG-1 mRNA stability. Interestingly, we observed that the intracellular NAG-1 protein induced by GL-V9 could, at least in part, localize in mitochondria where it might affect protein expression, thereby resulting in dissipation of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) and accumulation of mitochondrial superoxide, eventually facilitating to apoptosis events. Silence of NAG-1 could attenuate mitochondria related apoptosis caused by GL-V9. Moreover, GL-V9 suppressed tumor growth in xenograft model accompanied with upregulation of NAG-1 in tumor tissues. Collectively, these data demonstrated that NAG-1 could play an important role in mitochondria apoptosis triggered by GL-V9, thus providing novel mechanistic explanations and potential target for using GL-V9 as a chemotherapeutic agent against human hepatocellular carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "TGF\u03b2 signaling plays an important role in orchestrating a favorable microenvironment for tumor cell growth and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. As a conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammation drugs, tolfenamic acid (TA) has been previously reported to exhibit anti-cancer activity. Herein, we investigated the effect of TA on TGF\u03b2-mediated pro-metastatic activity and the underlying mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As a result, TA suppresses TGF\u03b2-induced migration and glycolysis in HCC cells, which is accompanied with reduced Smad phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear transcription activity. Mechanistically, TA promotes lipid raft-caveolar internalization pathway of TGF\u03b2 receptor, therefore leading to its rapid turnover. Consistently, TA inhibits constitutively active type I receptor induced Smad phosphorylation and EMT markers, whereas ectopic expression of type II receptor could partially rescue TGF\u03b2-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream genes expression in the presence of TA. Furthermore, TA inhibited HCC cells invasion in nude mice, associated with the alteration of characteristics related with EMT and glycolysis of cancer cells. Our study suggests TA could activate lipid raft pathway and modulate TGF\u03b2 mediated metastasis, implicating the potential application of TA as a modulator of tumor microenvironment in HCC.",

        "abstract": "Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors contributes to the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). We recently found that speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) was significantly downregulated and the inactivation of SPOP promoted metastasis in CRC. This study aimed to clarify its epigenetic alteration, molecular mechanisms and clinical significance in CRC. Our results revealed that the core region of SPOP promoter was hypermethylated in CRC tissues and its methylation was correlated with poor survival. Transcription factor RXRA had a vital role in the regulation of SPOP gene. The data indicated that DNA methylation at \u2212167\u2009bp of the SPOP gene altered the binding affinity between transcription factor RXRA and SPOP promoter. Moreover, SPOP was found to associate with Gli2 and promoted its ubiquitination and degradation in CRC. Consequently, the expression level of Hh/Gli2 pathway-related apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased and the function of resisting cell death was inhibited in CRC. It suggests that methylation status of SPOP promoter can be used as a novel epigenetic biomarker and a therapeutic target in CRC.",

Furthermore, up-regulated expression of SPOCK1 in CRC patients was associated with tumor size and TNM stage.

Our data suggest that inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was involved in down-regulation of SPOCK1-mediated suppression of tumor cell proliferation.

The aim of the present study was to investigate and examine the clinical value of GRK6 expression in human CRC. The expression of the GRK6 protein was determined in CRC tissues (n=83) and in normal colorectal tissues (n=19) by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to investigate GRK6 mRNA levels in matched pairs of cancerous and non-cancerous fresh frozen tissues from 19 patients with CRC. Furthermore, GRK6 protein levels were evaluated in matched pairs of cancerous and non-cancerous fresh frozen tissues from 19 other patients with CRC by western blot analysis. The expression of GRK6 was significantly upregulated in patients with CRC as indicated by IHC analysis (P=0.028). The results of RT-qPCR and western blotting confirmed that GRK6 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in CRC tissues compared with matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P<0.05). Additionally, GRK6 protein expression was significantly associated with histological differentiation (P=0.001), lymph node invasion (P=0.45), venous invasion (P=0.009), depth of invasion (P=0.026), distant metastasis (P<0.0001) and TNM stages (P=0.020). Survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method indicated that patients with high GRK6 expression levels exhibited lower overall survival rates compared with patients with low GRK6 expression. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model indicated that the expression levels of GRK6 (P=0.003) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival in patients. The overexpression of GRK6 in patients with CRC may serve as an independent predictor of patient outcome.",

        "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells lack the expression of ER, PR and HER2. Thus, TNBC patients cannot benefit from hormone receptor-targeted therapy as non-TNBC patients, but can only receive chemotherapy as the systemic treatment and have a worse overall outcome. More effective therapeutic targets and combination therapy strategies are urgently needed to improve the treatment effectiveness.  We analyzed the expression levels of EZH2 and TET1 in TCGA and our own breast cancer patient cohort, and tested their correlation with patient survival. We used TNBC and non-TNBC cell lines and mouse xenograft tumor model to unveil novel EZH2 targets and investigated the effect of EZH2 inhibition or TET1 overexpression in cell proliferation and viability of TNBC cells.  In TNBC cells, EZH2 decreases TET1 expression by H3K27me3 epigenetic regulation and subsequently suppresses anti-tumor p53 signaling pathway. Patients with high EZH2 and low TET1 presented the poorest survival outcome. Experimentally, targeting EZH2 in TNBC cells with specific inhibitor GSK343 or shRNA genetic approach could induce cell cycle arrest and senescence by elevating TET1 expression and p53 pathway activation. Using mouse xenograft model, we have tested a novel therapy strategy to combine GSK343 and chemotherapy drug Adriamycin and could show drastic and robust inhibition of TNBC tumor growth by synergistic induction of senescence and apoptosis.  We postulate that the well-controlled dynamic pathway EZH2-H3K27me3-TET1 is a novel epigenetic co-regulator module and provide evidence regarding how to exploit it as a novel therapeutic target via its pivotal role in senescence and apoptosis control. Of clinical and therapeutic significance, the present study opens a new avenue for TNBC treatment by targeting the EZH2-H3K27me3-TET1 pathway that can modulate the epigenetic landscape.",

        "abstract": "Talin1 is implicated in many cellular processes, which has been studied in various diseases using molecular biological technology. However, the detailed mechanism of talin1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell apoptosis remains unclear. This study was aimed at exploring the molecular mechanism mediating the effect of talin1 on the apoptosis of human HCC cells. We showed that shRNA-mediated talin1 loss led to a significant increase of apoptosis in HepG2 cells via upregulation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and PARP and downregulation of Bid protein levels. Talin1 knockdown decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and specially counteracted the effect of pCDNA-Akt in the PI3K/Akt pathway and down-regulated p50, p65, and p105 protein levels to inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB to promote apoptosis in HCC cells. Talin1 knockdown could enhance the inhibitory effects of I\u03baB\u03b1 on NF-\u03baB and suppress the activation of IKK\u03b2 to upregulate caspase-8, caspase-9, and PARP protein levels, thus leading to the increased apoptotic proportion in HCC cells. Moreover, talin1 could attenuate TNF-\u03b1 and TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which was readily reversed by RIP. Our results demonstrated that inhibition of talin1 suppressed the HCC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis by decreasing the activity of the PI3K/Akt/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. This new mechanism provides further understanding of the molecular signaling pathway in HCC cell apoptosis.",

Iron (Fe)-impregnated biochar produced by Cyperus alternifolius was added as a primary substrate. Results showed that all four pesticides were efficiently removed in the three IRCWs. The highest pesticide removals were achieved when Fe-impregnated biochar was added to the IRCW (99%), followed by the planted (64-99%) and plant-free IRCW (45-99%). The removal of pesticides in IRCWs followed first-order kinetics, with half-lives of 1.5-11.6h. A mass balance study revealed that sorption (32.2-98.6%) and microbial degradation (1.3-52.8%) were the main removal processes in all IRCWs. This study suggests that the IRCW is a promising system to treat pesticide-contaminated water, and plant and Fe-impregnated biochar can enhance pesticide removal. ",

        "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) contamination in aquatic systems remains a global concern with the biomagnification of methylmercury (MeHg) through primary consumers (zooplankton) to fish and humans. In this study, total mercury (THg) and MeHg concentrations were analyzed in zooplankton collected from Baihua reservoir (Guizhou Province, China). Our results demonstrated that THg and MeHg concentrations were strongly correlated to zooplankton community and biomass composition. The THg concentration was significantly higher in micro-zooplankton compared to meso-zooplankton and macro-zooplankton, and MeHg concentration increased significantly as body size increased. Hg increases in zooplankton were influenced by the numbers of calanoid copepods and Daphnia present relative to phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. Many zooplankton taxa in the three size-fractions were affected by THg exposure. The biomasses of Bosmina longirostris, Thermocyclops brevifurcatus, Asplanchna priodonta and Cyclops vicinus vicinus were positively correlated with Hg accumulation, while Daphnia hyalina, and Phyllodiaptomus tunguidus had a negative association. THg and MeHg bioaccumulation factors were correlated with phosphorus and total nitrogen concentration, zooplankton biomass, and chlorophyll-a concentration. Phosphorus loading was associated with increased THg and MeHg accumulation in the zooplankton highlighting biomagification with eutrophication. Chlorophyll-a levels were not correlated to THg and MeHg accumulation in zooplankton when phytoplankton densities were >10\u202fcells L and chlorophyll-a concentrations <9 \u03bcgL. This finding contradicts the idea of MeHg biodilution with increased algae biomass. However, changes in the phytoplankton species and biomass altered the availability of food for zooplankton, particularly micro-zooplankton and macro-zooplankton. Ultimately, the bioaccumulation of MeHg and THg across lower trophic levels was based more on the availability of preferred food resources than on total biological productivity.",

        "abstract": "To better understand the performance of constructed wetlands (CWs) to remove acidic pharmaceuticals (APs) in wastewaters in subtropical areas and to optimize CW design criteria, six small-scale CWs under different design configurations were operated. The factors (environmental parameters, water quality, and seasonality) influencing the APs removal were also analyzed to illustrate the removal mechanisms. The results indicated that the best performances of CWs were up to 80-90%. Subsurface flow (SSF) CWs showed high removal efficiency for ibuprofen, gemfibrozil and naproxen, but surface flow (SF) CWs performed better for ketoprofen and diclofenac. The positive relationship between the removal efficiencies of ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen with dissolved oxygen and ammonia nitrogen reveals that SSF CWs under aerobic conditions benefit the biodegradation, while the favorable conditions created by SF CWs for receiving solar radiation promote the effective photolysis of ketoprofen and diclofenac. Planted SSF CWs had significantly higher removal efficiencies of ibuprofen and gemfibrozil than the unplanted controls had in all seasons. The removal of all APs was higher in summer and autumn than those in winter. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between removal efficiency and the distribution coefficient (logDow) was observed in SF CWs. Overall, CWs that provide aerobic degradation and photolysis would benefit APs removal in subtropical areas in the south of China.",

        "abstract": "The removal efficiency of the pesticide chlorpyrifos (50 and 500\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL) by five wetland plant species (Cyperus alternifolius, Canna indica, Iris pseudacorus, Juncus effusus and Typha orientalis) was studied in recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland systems (RVFCWs). Results reveal that for chlorpyrifos at different concentrations, good removal efficiencies (94-98%) were observed using the same plant systems, while no significant differences in removal efficiencies were seen between the different plant systems. In addition, the chlorpyrifos removal efficiency of the planted systems increased significantly compared with the unplanted controls. The chlorpyrifos removal efficiency for wetland systems over time fit to the first-order kinetic model, with the first-order kinetic constant (k) ranging from 0.045 to 0.065 h. The half-life of chlorpyrifos in the systems ranged from 10.66-15.43\u202fh. The shortest chlorpyrifos half-life was detected in the wetland system containing C.\u00a0indica, followed by that with C.\u00a0alternifolius and I.\u00a0pseudacorus. The main pathways to remove chlorpyrifos in these wetland systems were sorption (accounting for 64.6-86.4% of the total removal efficiency) and biodegradation (8.1-33.7%). Plants can enhance chlorpyrifos removal through enhanced biodegradation in the system. Plants with high biomass and transpiration were able to accelerate the removal of chlorpyrifos and conventional pollutants. Hence, C.\u00a0indica, C.\u00a0alternifolius and I.\u00a0pseudacorus could be used as optimal plants for pesticide removal in wetland systems.",

        "abstract": "Carbon isotope analysis and 454 pyrosequencing methods were used to investigate in situ biodegradation of chlorpyrifos during its transport through three model integrated recirculating constructed wetlands (IRCWs). Results show that plant and Fe-impregnated biochar promoted degradation of chlorpyrifos and its metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP). Carbon isotope ratios in the IRCWs shifted to -31.24\u00b10.58\u2030 (IRCW1, plant free), -26.82\u00b10.60\u2030 (IRCW2, with plant) and -24.76\u00b10.94\u2030 (IRCW3, with plant and Fe-biochar). The enrichment factors (\u0190) were determined as -0.69\u00b10.06\u2030 (IRCW1), -0.91\u00b10.07\u2030 (IRCW2) and -1.03\u00b10.09\u2030 (IRCW3). Microbial community analysis showed that IRCW3 was dominated by members of Bacillus, which can utilize and degrade chlorpyrifos. These results reveal that plant and Fe-biochar can induce carbon isotope fractionation and have a positive impact on the chlorpyrifos degradation efficiency by influencing the development of beneficial microbial communities.",

        "abstract": "Fe-impregnated biochar was assessed as a method to remove the pesticide pollutant chlorpyrifos, utilizing biochar/FeO composite synthesized via chemical coprecipitation of Fe/Fe onto Cyperus alternifolius biochar. Fe-impregnated biochar exhibited a higher sorption capacity than pristine biochar, resulting in more efficient removal of chlorpyrifos from water. Soil was dosed with pristine or Fe-impregnated biochar at 0.1 or 1.0% w/w, to evaluate chlorpyrifos uptake in Allium fistulosum L. (Welsh onion). The results showed that the average concentration of chlorpyrifos and its degradation product, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP), decreased in A.\u00a0fistulosum L. with increased levels of pristine biochar and Fe-biochar. Fe-biochar was found to be more effective in reducing the uptake of chlorpyrifos by improving the sorption ability and increasing plant root iron plaque. Bioavailability of chlorpyrifos is reduced with both biochar and Fe-biochar soil dosing; however, the greatest persistence of chlorpyrifos residues was observed with 1.0% pristine biochar. Microbial community analysis showed Fe-biochar to have a positive impact on the efficiency of chlorpyrifos degradation in soils, possibly by altering microbial communities.",

The aim of this study was to screen for 19 pesticides in rural rivers in Guangzhou, China, evaluating the potential impact of detected pesticides on the local ecosystem. Sampling was performed in rural rivers in three environment types: agricultural, industrial, and unpolluted, with sampling of water and sediments in both wet and dry seasons. A total of 11 pesticides were detected overall and their spatiotemporal distribution in water and ecological risk were assessed. Five pesticides were detected at concentrations above 100\u00a0ng\u00a0L, with the highest concentration pesticides being dimethoate (1318\u00a0ng\u00a0L) in surface water and quinalphos (328\u00a0ng\u00a0g dry weight (dw)) in sediments. The most commonly detected pesticides were chlorpyrifos, acetochlor, and butachlor with detection frequencies of 50-57% and 29-43%, in water and sediments, respectively. Samples from the agricultural rural river contained the most pesticides and at higher concentrations, as compared to industrial and unpolluted areas, especially during the wet season. Ecotoxicological risk assessment through Risk Quotients (RQs) showed that chlorpyrifos and fenvalerate pose high ecological risks in water and therefore, reduction of the source input of these pesticides is essential.",

The SCW and ABF showed different performance on PEDCs removal because of process structural difference. The removal percentages of PEDCs were associated with their octanol-water partition coefficients (Log Kow ), except 4-nonlyphenol (4-NP) whose apparent removal rate was affected by its precursors, and declined in the order of triclosan (TCS) at 80% and 69%, 4- t -octylphenol (4- t -OP) at 58% and 51%, estrone (E1) at 48% and 44%, and bisphenol-A (BPA) at 45% and 32% in the SCW and ABF systems on average, respectively. The efficiencies of SCW and ABF were superior to the single type of CWs, such as surface flow CW, vertical flow CW, and horizontal flow CW, in terms of removal rates or first-order removal rate constants. Recommended value of HLR for optimal utilization of SCW and ABF to ensure essential removal of PEDCs from STP discharge was between 1.5 and 2.0\u00a0m/d.",

        "abstract": "Wetland plants are proven to perform well in water treatment. However, the phytoremediation capability of wetland plants for antibiotics, especially the uptake and metabolism involved in\u00a0vivo, is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the removal, uptake, and specific metabolism by Canna indica and Iris pseudacorus of five sulfonamides (SAs) using hydroponic experiments for seven days. The removal of SAs ranged from 15.2% to 98.4% in the planted groups, whereas that in the unplanted control group was much lower (12.6%-39.9%). The accumulation of SAs in plants was in a concentration-dependent manner via an active process and is not a major removal mechanism (constituted 0.31%-3.62% of the total removal load in plant system). The results also showed differences in the removal and accumulation by plant species of SAs. The acetyl conjugates (N-acetyl SA) were formed, which significantly enhanced the uptake of SAs (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) except sulfapyridine. The concentrations of N-acetyl SA accounted for only 0.4%-23.8% of the total SAs distribution in plants, suggesting the involvement of other metabolism pathways. Methylation and oxidation metabolites were identified in plant tissues and no SA-induced growth stress occurred, revealing that antibiotic metabolism in\u00a0vivo should be associated with the ability of wetland plants to accumulate antibiotic and tolerate antibiotic stress.",

        "abstract": "Environmental indigenous bacteria (Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas) were isolated from 9 different constructed wetlands (CWs) in summer and winter. The antibiotic resistance analysis of the isolated bacteria was conducted by Kirby-Bauer disc agar diffusion method. And the quantitative PCR assay was used to quantify the abundance of class I integron (int1) in the matrix of CWs. The results indicated that over 84% of isolates among the 522 Staphylococcus strains and 543 Pseudomonas strains had antibiotic resistance and above 68% of isolates had multi-antibiotic resistance, the average of MRI index was 0.22. Antibiotic resistance of indigenous bacteria in CWs was at the same resistance level of human or animal bacteria in certain environment, indicating that indigenous bacteria from constructed wetlands had relatively high level of resistance. Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas strains had higher resistances to Ampicillin (AMP) and Sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and extremely low resistance rates of lower than 3% to Tetracycline (TE), Gentamicin (CN) and Ciprofloxacin (CIP). To Ceftazidime (CAZ) and Chloramphenicol (C), the two kinds of indigenous bacteria showed distinctly different resistances. Quantitative PCR revealed that the abundance of intl in CWs was 1.14 x 10(5)-5.66 x 10(5) copies \u00b7 g(-1), and its relative abundance was 0.54%-3.68%. Both of season and wetland type had important impact on antibiotic resistance and abundance of int1. The antibiotic resistance rate and the multiple resistance index (MRI) for the indigenous bacteria and the abundance of int1 in summer were higher than those in winter. Among three types of CWs, the antibiotic resistance rate and the MRI value were the highest in the downward vertical flow, while the int1 abundance was the highest in the sub-surface flow. The research indicated that indigenous bacteria acquired antibiotic resistance due to long term exposure to antibiotics of certain concentrations and antibiotic-resistant intestinal bacteria in sewage environment. The environmental risks of antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistant genes in CWs should not be ignored.",

        "abstract": "In modern epidemiological and clinical studies, the covariates of interest may involve genome sequencing, biomarker assay, or medical imaging and thus are prohibitively expensive to measure on a large number of subjects. A cost-effective solution is the two-phase design, under which the outcome and inexpensive covariates are observed for all subjects during the first phase and that information is used to select subjects for measurements of expensive covariates during the second phase. For example, subjects with extreme values of quantitative traits were selected for whole-exome sequencing in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). Herein, we consider general two-phase designs, where the outcome can be continuous or discrete, and inexpensive covariates can be continuous and correlated with expensive covariates. We propose a semiparametric approach to regression analysis by approximating the conditional density functions of expensive covariates given inexpensive covariates with B-spline sieves. We devise a computationally efficient and numerically stable EM-algorithm to maximize the sieve likelihood. In addition, we establish the consistency, asymptotic normality, and asymptotic efficiency of the estimators. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over existing ones through extensive simulation studies. Finally, we present applications to the aforementioned NHLBI ESP.",

        "abstract": "Red blood cell (RBC) traits provide insight into a wide range of physiological states and exhibit moderate to high heritability, making them excellent candidates for genetic studies to inform underlying biologic mechanisms. Previous RBC trait genome-wide association studies were performed primarily in European- or Asian-ancestry populations, missing opportunities to inform understanding of RBC genetic architecture in diverse populations and reduce intervals surrounding putative functional SNPs through fine-mapping. Here, we report the first fine-mapping of six correlated (Pearson's r range: |0.04 - 0.92|) RBC traits in up to 19,036 African Americans and 19,562 Hispanic/Latinos participants of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) consortium. Trans-ethnic meta-analysis of race/ethnic- and study-specific estimates for approximately 11,000 SNPs flanking 13 previously identified association signals as well as 150,000 additional array-wide SNPs was performed using inverse-variance meta-analysis after adjusting for study and clinical covariates. Approximately half of previously reported index SNP-RBC trait associations generalized to the trans-ethnic study population (p<1.7x10 ); previously unreported independent association signals within the ABO region reinforce the potential for multiple functional variants affecting the same locus. Trans-ethnic fine-mapping did not reveal additional signals at the HFE locus independent of the known functional variants. Finally, we identified a potential novel association in the Hispanic/Latino study population at the HECTD4/RPL6 locus for RBC count (p=1.9x10 ). The identification of a previously unknown association, generalization of a large proportion of known association signals, and refinement of known association signals all exemplify the benefits of genetic studies in diverse populations.

        "abstract": "Current knowledge of the genetic architecture of key reproductive events across the female life course is largely based on association studies of European descent women. The relevance of known loci for age at menarche (AAM) and age at natural menopause (ANM) in diverse populations remains unclear. We investigated 32 AAM and 14 ANM previously-identified loci and sought to identify novel loci in a trans-ethnic array-wide study of 196,483 SNPs on the MetaboChip (Illumina, Inc.). A total of 45,364 women of diverse ancestries (African, Hispanic/Latina, Asian American and American Indian/Alaskan Native) in the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study were included in cross-sectional analyses of AAM and ANM. Within each study we conducted a linear regression of SNP associations with self-reported or medical record-derived AAM or ANM (in years), adjusting for birth year, population stratification, and center/region, as appropriate, and meta-analyzed results across studies using multiple meta-analytic techniques. For both AAM and ANM, we observed more directionally consistent associations with the previously reported risk alleles than expected by chance (p-valuesbinomial\u22640.01). Eight densely genotyped reproductive loci generalized significantly to at least one non-European population. We identified one trans-ethnic array-wide SNP association with AAM and two significant associations with ANM, which have not been described previously. Additionally, we observed evidence of independent secondary signals at three of six AAM trans-ethnic loci. Our findings support the transferability of reproductive trait loci discovered in European women to women of other race/ethnicities and indicate the presence of additional trans-ethnic associations both at both novel and established loci. These findings suggest the benefit of including diverse populations in future studies of the genetic architecture of female growth and development.",

        "abstract": "Even though there has been great success in identifying lipid-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the mechanisms through which the SNPs act on each trait are poorly understood. The emergence of large, complex biological data sets in well-characterized cohort studies offers an opportunity to investigate the genetic effects on trait variability as a way of informing the causal genes and biochemical pathways that are involved in lipoprotein metabolism. However, methods for simultaneously analyzing multiple omics, environmental exposures, and longitudinally measured, correlated phenotypes are lacking. The purpose of our study was to demonstrate the utility of the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to inform our understanding of the pathways by which genetic variants lead to disease risk. With the SEM method, we examine multiple pathways directly and indirectly through previously identified triglyceride (TG)-associated SNPs, methylation, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), including sex, age, and smoking behavior, while adding in biologically plausible direct and indirect pathways. We observed significant SNP effects (\u2009<\u20090.05 and directionally consistent) on TGs at visit 4 (TG4) for five loci, including rs645040 (), rs964184 (/), rs4765127 (), rs1121980 (), and rs10401969 (). Across these loci, we identify three with strong evidence of an indirect genetic effect on TG4 through HDL, one with evidence of pleiotropic effect on HDL and TG4, and one variant that acts on TG4 indirectly through a nearby methylation site. Such information can be used to prioritize candidate genes in regions of interest, inform mechanisms of action of methylation effects, and highlight possible genes with pleiotropic effects.",

        "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 schizophrenia (SCZ)-associated loci, but using these findings to illuminate disease biology remains a challenge. Here we present integrative risk gene selector (iRIGS), a Bayesian framework that integrates multi-omics data and gene networks to infer risk genes in GWAS loci. By applying iRIGS to SCZ GWAS data, we predicted a set of high-confidence risk genes, most of which are not the nearest genes to the GWAS index variants. High-confidence risk genes account for a significantly enriched heritability, as estimated by stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression. Moreover, high-confidence risk genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissues, especially prenatally, and are enriched for targets of approved drugs, suggesting opportunities to reposition existing drugs for SCZ. Thus, iRIGS can leverage accumulating functional genomics and GWAS data to advance our understanding of SCZ etiology and potential therapeutics.",

To conduct a design in the class, one first summarizes the longitudinal outcomes by fitting a simple linear regression of the response on a time-varying covariate for each subject. Sampling strata are defined by splitting the estimated regression intercept or slope distributions into distinct (low, medium, and high) regions. Stratified sampling is then conducted from strata defined by the intercepts, slopes, or from a mixture. In general, samples selected with extreme intercept values will yield low variances for time-fixed exposure associations with the outcome and samples enriched with extreme slope values will yield low variances for time-varying exposure associations with the outcome (including interactions with time-varying exposures). We describe ascertainment corrected maximum likelihood and multiple imputation estimation procedures that permit valid and efficient inferences. We embed all methodological developments within the framework of conducting a sub-study that seeks to examine genetic associations with lung function in continuously smoking participants in the Lung Health Study.",

Published GWAS of hematocrit have identified multiple loci, yet few studies have included populations of Hispanic or African descent, thereby limiting opportunities to identify population-specific variants or narrow associated regions for functional analysis. We present a fine-mapping analysis of six previously identified hematocrit loci in African American and Hispanic/Latino participants of the PAGE study. Methods: Approximately 200,000 genotyped or imputed Metabochip variants were examined for association with hematocrit (proportion of whole blood comprising red blood cells) in 19,822 Hispanic/Latino and 19,973 African American participants. SNPs were excluded on a population-specific basis if effective heterozygosity was u003c 30. Primary and conditional analyses were performed in Plink, ProbABEL, or SuGen; fixed-effects meta-analyses were performed in Metal. Trans-ethnic and anc...",

        "abstract": "Meta-analysis is essential to the discovery of rare variants that influence complex diseases and traits. Four major software packages, namely MASS, MetaSKAT, RAREMETAL, and seqMeta, have been developed to perform meta-analysis of rare-variant associations. These packages first generate summary statistics for each study and then perform the meta-analysis by combining the summary statistics. Because of incompatible file formats and non-equivalent summary statistics, the output files from the study-level analysis of one package cannot be directly used to perform meta-analysis in another package. We developed a computationally efficient software program, PreMeta, to resolve the non-compatibility of the four software packages and to facilitate meta-analysis of large-scale sequencing studies in a consortium setting. PreMeta reformats the output files of study-level summary statistics generated by the four packages (text files produced by MASS and RAREMETAL, binary files produced by MetaSKAT, and R data files produced by seqMeta) and translates the summary statistics from one form to another, such that the summary statistics from any package can be used to perform meta-analysis in any other package. With this tool, consortium members are not required to use the same software for study-level analyses. In addition, PreMeta checks for allele mismatches, corrects summary statistics, and allows the rescaled inverse normal transformation to be performed at the meta-analysis stage by rescaling summary statistics. PreMeta processes summary statistics from the four packages to make them compatible and avoids the need to redo study-level analyses. PreMeta documentation and executable are available at:                     http://dlin.web.unc.edu/software/premeta                                      .",

Low doses of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) (<1 \u03bcg/mL) were shown not to protect against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. However, the effect of high doses of MBL has not been investigated. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) has been proposed as an alternative receptor for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. In this study, we examined the expression of DC-SIGN on DCs as well as on acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. High doses of recombinant or human MBL inhibited binding of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 to both these cell types in the presence of complement derived from bovine serum. Further, anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody inhibited binding of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 to both DC-SIGN-expressing DCs and THP-1 cells. This study demonstrates that high doses of MBL can inhibit binding of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus to DC-SIGN-expressing cells in the presence of complement. Our results suggest that DC-SIGN may be an alternative receptor for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.",

        "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder associated with copper metabolism. Early diagnosis and therapy can result in good prognosis of WD. Thus, it is highly recommended to perform familial screening. In this study, we aimed to investigate the range of familial screening of children with WD and determine the appropriate screening methods.We enrolled 20 children with WD and 50 family members of each of these patients (40 parents and 10 siblings). All the subjects underwent a physical examination, Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings in the cornea, abdominal ultrasonography (Abdl Ur), cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), serum ceruloplasmin, serum copper, 24-hour urine copper, blood alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and ATP7B gene.Two new patients with presymptomatic WD (1 mother and 1 brother) in 2 families were found by screening. They had no clinical symptoms and K-F rings in corneal. Biochemical examination indicated decreased serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper in the mother and decreased serum ceruloplasmin in the brother. Gene sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations in them. In addition, 48 heterozygous carriers of Wilson disease (WHDzc) were found in this study. The levels of ceruloplasmin and serum copper in patients of WD were significantly less than WHDzc and 24-hour urinary copper were significantly higher than WHDzc (P\u200a=\u200a.000). The biochemical profiles of WD and WDHzc overlapped in range of 0.8 to 1.5\u200ag/L in ceruloplasmin, above 9\u200a\u03bcmol/L in serum copper and below 100\u200a\u03bcg/24\u200ah in urinary copper. Gene sequencing showed 2 pathological mutations in all patients with WD and 1 pathological mutation in all WDHzc.Not only siblings but also the previous generation of children probands with WD should be screened. Genetic testing should be conducted for the diagnosis of presymptomatic patients with WD.",

The fusion protein expression plasmid pEGFP-UL54 was constructed and cotransfected into AD293 cells with the lentiviral vector pGCL-GFP expressing small hairpin RNA (shRNA) especially targeting the UL54 gene. At 24, 48, and 72 h posttransfection, expression of the fusion protein was detected by fluorescence microscopy and Western blot. The level of UL54 mRNA was semiquantitated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. It was found that, compared with the negative control, expression of the EGFP-UL54 fusion protein was efficiently inhibited and the mRNA level of the UL54 gene decreased significantly in cells introduced with a shRNA producing plasmid called pGCL-UL54-1479. However, the plasmid pGCL-UL54-2884 had no significant inhibitive effect on protein expression or mRNA level. It may be concluded that introduction of shRNA targeting UL54 gene of HCMV could specifically inhibit the expression of viral DNA polymerase in vitro. Nucleotides 1479-1499 of the UL54 gene seems to be an effective target site of RNAi.",

WD has a high mortality rate and disability rate, however, it is one of the treatable hereditary diseases. Irreversible tissue injury can be prevented if WD was diagnosed and treated before the development of clinical symptoms. Thus it is necessary to screen WD in the family members of the proband. First-degree relatives of a proband with WD should be screened. First-degree relatives should include the previous generation, siblings and the next generation. If available, genetic testing can be used as the primary screening method. Although the relatives of a proband are more likely to be patients with WD, the diagnosis should be based on sufficient evidence to avoid unnecessary lifelong treatment.",

However, this technique has been challenged since severe complications have been observed in clinical practices. As a result, clinicians have started to seek other minimally invasive surgeries with equivalent efficacy. The corresponding surgeries were assessed by the five outcomes: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progression disease (PD) and objective response rate (ORR). Direct meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were performed and the results were represented by odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence and credential intervals. Furthermore, the value of surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA)was calculated to provide corresponding rankings.Seventeen studies were incorporated into the network meta-analysis which indicated that TACE + external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and drug-eluting beads (DEB) were better than TACE at controllingPD. TACE + EBRT demonstrated their advantages compared to TARE-90Y.However, network meta-analysis comparison showed no significant difference between the corresponding eight treatments with respect to CR, PR, SD and ORR. Moreover, the SUCRA suggested that TACE+EBRT were better than other treatments at treating unresectableHCC.Based on the present results of this network meta-analysis, TACE + EBRT was more effective than the other seven minimally invasive surgeries and therefore it is considered as the optimal treatment for HCC.",

This study explored in vivo and vitro effects of miR-29b-3p in granulomatous liver fibrosis by targeting COL1A1 and COL3A1 in Schistosoma japonicum infection. Thirty male Balb/c mice were assigned to normal control and model (percutaneous infection of cercariae of S. japonicum) groups. NIH-3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts were designated into blank, NC, miR-29b-3p mimic, TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b21\u2009+\u2009NC, and TGF-\u03b21\u2009+\u2009miR-29b-3p mimic groups. HE and Masson staining were employed to observe the pathological changes and collagenous fibrosis. The expression of \u03b1-SMA, COL1A1, COL3A1, TIMP-1 was determined by immunohistochemistry. The RT-qPCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were conducted to determine expression of miR-29b-3p, COL1A1, and COL3A1. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate viability and apoptosis. The relative expression of miR-29b-3p decreased in the model group. The model group showed marked fibrosis in liver tissues. The expression of \u03b1-SMA, COL1A1, COL3A1, TIMP-1 was higher in the model group than that in the normal control group. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that miR-29b-3p directly targeted COL1A1 and COL3A1. Compared with the blank, NC, TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b21\u2009+\u2009NC groups, the miR-29b-3p mimic group exhibited up-regulated expression of miR-29b-3p and MMP-9 but down-regulated expression of TIMP-1, HSP47, \u03b1-SMA, COL1A1, and COL3A1; while lower cell viability but higher apoptosis rate showed. It indicated that miR-29b-3p prevents S. japonicum-induced liver fibrosis by inhibiting COL1A1 and COL3A1.",

The past-customer emotion outlined in their reviews plays an important role in not only the purchasing decisions of potential consumers, but also in manufacturersu0027 production plans and in businessu0027 maintenance of their shopping environments. This paper proposes a sentiment analysis approach based on the domain dictionary for extracting subjective customer emotion and objective commodity metadata from review pages and analysing their relationships. The value of the proposed approach was demonstrated through a case study by using online apparel reviews of an anonymous brand in China. The study found that the domain dictionary can be more effective in extracting emotional information. Coats, shirts, and t-shirts garner higher emotions than pants. Sales increase as the emotion increases and decrease as the price increases. A fixed price range, in which the clothing has higher emotion and sales, can ...",

Most of the available technologies only measure positive strain (stretching), and cannot measure negative strains (compression). We propose here a stretchable technology that enables the measurement of both negative and positive strains with high sensitivity. A carbon nanotube paper is pre-cracked to introduce a well-controlled network of open cracks as the sensing element; then, the pre-cracked paper is sandwiched by thermoplastic elastomer. The resulting sensor is also pre-stretched and subjected to thermal annealing, which removes any residual stress so the pre-streched configuration remains stable. This process results in a stretchable structure with a network of open cracks that is sensitive to both negative and positive strains. We demonstrate that such sensors can measure negative strains up to -13% with high sensitivity and robust stretchability.",

        "abstract": "The stereo-digital image correlation technique using two synchronized industrial-grade cameras has been extensively used for full-field 3D shape, displacement and deformation measurements. However, its use in resource-limited institutions and field settings is inhibited by the need for relatively expensive, bulky and complicated experimental set-ups. To mitigate this problem, we established a cost-effective and ultra-portable smartphone-based stereo-digital image correlation system, which only uses a smartphone and an optical attachment. This optical attachment is composed of four planar mirrors and a 3D-printed mirror support, and can split the incoming scene into two sub-images, simulating a stereovision system using two virtual smartphones. Although such a mirror-based system has already been used for stereo-image correlation, this is the first time it has been combined with a commercial smartphone. This publication explores the potential and limitations of such a configuration. We first verified the effectiveness and accuracy of this system in 3D shape and displacement measurement through shape measurement and in-plane and out-of-plane translation tests. Severe thermal-induced virtual strains (up to 15,000 \u03bc\u03b5) were found in the measured results due to the smartphone heating. The mechanism for the generation of the temperature-dependent errors in this system was clearly and reasonably explained. After a simple preheating process, the smartphone-based system was demonstrated to be accurate in measuring the strain on the surface of a loaded composite specimen, with comparable accuracy to a strain gauge. Measurements of 3D deformation are illustrated by tracking the deformation on the surface of a deflating ball. This cost-effective and ultra-portable smartphone-based system not only greatly decreases the hardware investment in the system construction, but also increases convenience and efficiency of 3D deformation measurements, thus demonstrating a large potential in resource-limited and field settings.",

During x-ray tomographic imaging, the heat generated by the x-ray tube changes the imaging geometry of x-ray scanner, and further introduces noticeable errors in DVC measurements. In this work, to provide practical guidance high-accuracy DVC measurement, the errors in displacements and strains measured by DVC due to the self-heating for effect of a commercially available x-ray scanner were experimentally investigated. The errors were characterized by performing simple rescan tests with different scan durations. The results indicate that the maximum strain errors associated with the self-heating of the x-ray scanner exceed 400 \u00b5e. Possible approaches for minimizing or correcting these displacement and strain errors are discussed. Finally, a series of translation and uniaxial compression tests were performed, in which strain errors were detected and then removed using pre-established artificial dilatational strain-time curve. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed strain error correction approach.",

First, pulsed CO 2  laser irradiation was uniformly deployed on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) substrates. Next, double cantilever beam (DCB) tests were performed to assess the effects of surface pretreatments on the mode I fracture toughness of the adhesive joints. Then, a thoughtful combination of the proposed surface pretreatments was deployed to fabricate DCB specimens with patterned interfaces. A wide range of techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact profilometry, and optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to ascertain the effects of all investigated surface pretreatments. It is shown that patterning promoted damage mechanisms that were not observed in the uniformly treated interfaces, resulting in an effective fracture toughness well above that predicted by a classical rule of mixture.",

An efficient and easy method to analyze nonlinear viscoelasticity remains elusive because the dynamic moduli (storage modulus and loss modulus) are not very convenient when the material falls into nonlinear viscoelastic range. In this study, we utilize two methods, Fourier transform and geometrical nonlinear analysis, to quantitatively characterize the nonlinear viscoelasticity of a pre-compressed layered polymeric composite under oscillatory compression. We discuss the influences of pre-compression, dynamic loading, and the inner structure of polymeric composite on the nonlinear viscoelasticity. Furthermore, we reveal the nonlinear viscoelastic mechanism by combining with other experimental results from quasi-static compressive tests and microstructural analysis. From a methodology standpoint, it is proved that both Fourier transform and geometrical nonlinear analysis are efficient tools for analyzing the nonlinear viscoelasticity of a layered polymeric composite. From a material standpoint, we consequently posit that the dynamic nonlinear viscoelasticity of polymeric composites with complicated inner structures can also be well characterized using these methods.",

However, the joint performance can be ultimately affected by surface modifications attained through different surface preparation strategies. Thus, there is still a need for experimental techniques capable of assessing the mechanical properties associated with different surface preparations, and their relation to the damage morphology at initiation. In this work, a refined experimental set-up was used to perform three-point bending tests on miniaturized single-lap composite joints. Such testing configuration features a peel-dominant stress field within the bondline and the possibility to track the evolution of adhesive deformation and damage  in situ  at the meso-scale using optical microscopy. Epoxy-bonded CFRP joints were evaluated as a function of various surface pretreatments.  In situ  local observation obtained during mechanical loading provided insights into the detailed mechanisms taking place depending on the surface preparation strategies.",

A systematic drawback of this technique, however, is the smoothening of the kinematic field (e.g., displacement and strains) across interfaces between dissimilar materials, where the deformation gradient is known to be large. This can become an issue when a high level of accuracy is needed, for example, in the interfacial region of composites or joints. In this work, we described the application of global conforming finite-element-based DIC technique to obtain precise kinematic fields at interfaces between dissimilar materials.

Our method uses a warp-and-project approach that allows us to introduce an essentially continuous time axis where consistency of the reconstructed shape with the projection images is enforced for the specific time and deformation state at which the image was captured.

Unfortunately, tomographic reconstruction of complex shapes requires a multitude (often hundreds or thousands) of projections from different viewpoints. Such a large number of projections can only be acquired in a time-sequential fashion. This significantly limits the ability to use x-ray tomography for either objects that undergo uncontrolled shape change at the time scale of a scan, or else for analyzing dynamic phenomena, where the motion itself is under investigation.\n\nIn this work, we present a non-parametric space-time tomographic method for tackling such dynamic settings. Through a combination of a new CT image acquisition strategy, a space-time tomographic image formation model, and an alternating, multi-scale solver, we achieve a general approach that can be used to analyze a wide range of dynamic phenomena. We demonstrate our method with extensive experiments on both real and simulated data.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Text in natural images typically adds meaning to an object or scene. In particular, text specifies which business places serve drinks (e.g., cafe, teahouse) or food (e.g., restaurant, pizzeria), and what kind of service is provided (e.g., massage, repair). The mere presence of text, its words, and meaning are closely related to the semantics of the object or scene. This paper exploits textual contents in images for fine-grained business place classification and logo retrieval. There are four main contributions. First, we show that the textual cues extracted by the proposed method are effective for the two tasks. Combining the proposed textual and visual cues outperforms visual only classification and retrieval by a large margin. Second, to extract the textual cues, a generic and fully unsupervised word box proposal method is introduced. The method reaches state-of-the-art word detection recall with a limited number of proposals. Third, contrary to what is widely acknowledged in text detection literature, we demonstrate that high recall in word detection is more important than high f-score at least for both tasks considered in this work. Last, this paper provides a large annotated text detection dataset with 10 K images and 27\u2009601 word boxes.",

While the state-of-the-art relies on visual cues only, this paper is the first work which proposes to combine textual and visual cues. Another novelty is the textual cue extraction. Unlike the state-of-the-art text detection methods, we focus more on the background instead of text regions. Once text regions are detected, they are further processed by two methods to perform text recognition, i.e., ABBYY commercial OCR engine and a state-of-the-art character recognition algorithm. Then, to perform textual cue encoding, bi- and trigrams are formed between the recognized characters by considering the proposed spatial pairwise constraints. Finally, extracted visual and textual cues are combined for fine-grained classification. The proposed method is validated on four publicly available data sets: ICDAR03, ICDAR13, Con-Text, and Flickr-logo. We improve the state-of-the-art end-to-end character recognition by a large margin of 15% on ICDAR03. We show that textual cues are useful in addition to visual cues for fine-grained classification. We show that textual cues are also useful for logo retrieval. Adding textual cues outperforms visual- and textual-only in fine-grained classification (70.7% to 60.3%) and logo retrieval (57.4% to 54.8%).",

We define three variants of tracking by language specification: one relying on lingual target specification only, one relying on visual target specification based on language, and one leveraging their joint capacity. To show the potential of tracking by natural language specification we extend two popular tracking datasets with lingual descriptions and report experiments.

        "abstract": "Long-term tracking requires extreme stability to the multitude of model updates and robustness to the disappearance and loss of the target as such will inevitably happen. For motivation, we have taken 10 randomly selected OTB-sequences, doubled each by attaching a reversed version and repeated each double sequence 20 times. On most of these repetitive videos, the best current tracker performs worse on each loop. This illustrates the difference between optimization for short-term versus long-term tracking. In a long-term tracker a combined global and local search strategy is beneficial, allowing for recovery from failures and disappearance. Most importantly, the proposed tracker also employs cautious updating, guided by self-quality assessment. The proposed tracker is still among the best on the 20-sec OTB-videos while achieving state-of-the-art on the 100-sec UAV20L benchmark. On 10 new half-an-hour videos with city bicycling, sport games etc, the proposed tracker outperforms others by a large margin where the 2010 TLD tracker comes second.",

Polymerase chain reaction assays were performed for analysis of cagT, ORF13 and ORF10 genes in the cagII region.Of 171 H pylori isolates from Zhejiang patients, 159(93.0%) were positive for all the three loci. One isolate (0.6%) was negative for all the three loci, and 11(6.4%) were partially deleted in cagII. The positive rates of cagT, ORF13 and ORF10 genes were 97.1%, 94.7% and 99.4%, respectively. In the strains isolated from the patients with diseases including chronic superficial gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer, the sitive rates of cagT were 95.7%, 100.0%, 95.1% and 100.0%, respectively. The positive rates of ORF13 were 94.3%, 93.5%, 95.1% and 100.0%, respectively. The sitive rates of ORF10 were 98.6%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 100.0%, respectively. The three genes were all positive in the three H pylori strains isolated from the patients with both gastric and duodenal ulcer. In the five strains isolated from the patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, only one isolate was negative for ORF13. There were no significant differences of the cagT, ORF13 and ORF10 genes among the different gastroduodenal diseases including chronic superficial gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, both gastric and duodenal ulcer and gastric adenocarcinoma (chi(2)=3.098, P>0.05 for cagT; chi(2)=3.935, P>0.05 for ORF13 and chi(2)=6.328, P>0.05 for ORF10).The cagII is not a uniform and conserved entity.

        "abstract": "As a typical form of geographical phenomena, spatial flow events have been widely studied in contexts like migration, daily commuting, and information exchange through telecommunication. Studying the spatial pattern of spatial flow data serves to reveal essential information about the underlying process generating the phenomena. Most methods of global clustering pattern detection and local clusters detection analysis are focused on single-location spatial events or fail to preserve the integrity of spatial flow events. In this research a new spatial statistical approach of detecting clustering (clusters) of flow data that extends the classical local K-function, while maintaining the integrity of flow data was introduced. Through the appropriate measurement of spatial proximity relationships between entire flows, the new method successfully upgraded the classical hot spot detection method to the stage of \u201chot flow\u201d detection. Spatial proximity of flows was measured by a four-dimensional distance. Several specific aspects of the method were discussed to provide evidence of its robustness and expandability, such as the multiscale issue, relative importance control and adaptive scale detection, using a real dataset of vehicle theft and recovery location pairs in Charlotte, NC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rubber ( Hevea brasiliensis ) plantations are a rapidly increasing source of land cover change in mainland Southeast Asia. Stand age of rubber plantations obtained at fine scales provides essential baseline data, informing the pace of industrial and smallholder agricultural activities in response to the changing global rubber markets, and local political and socioeconomic dynamics. In this study, we developed an integrated pixel- and object-based tree growth model using Landsat annual time series to estimate the age of rubber plantations in a 21,115\u202fkm 2  tri-border region along the junction of China, Myanmar and Laos. We produced a rubber stand age map at 30\u202fm resolution, with an accuracy of 87.00% for identifying rubber plantations and an average error of 1.53\u202fyears in age estimation. The integration of pixel- and object-based image analysis showed superior performance in building NDVI yearly time series that reduced spectral noises from background soil and vegetation in open-canopy, young rubber stands. The model parameters remained relatively stable during model sensitivity analysis, resulting in accurate age estimation robust to outliers. Compared to the typically weak statistical relationship between single-date spectral signatures and rubber tree age, Landsat image time series analysis coupled with tree growth modeling presents a viable alternative for fine-scale age estimation of rubber plantations.",

Firstly, analyzing characters of the optimal wavelet packet transform and the incomplete wavelet packet transform, the conclusion that the latter is perfect for fault diagnosis of analog circuit is obtained. Secondly, in order to perform multi-class classification, binary-tree-based SVMs has been studied. By introducing the separability measure that based on the space distribution of pattern classes, an improved balanced binary-tree structure is constructed. The proposed algorithm for analog circuits with tolerances and noise is implemented, and simulation results show us that compared with several existent fault diagnosis methods, the current algorithm has highest classification speed and higher classification accuracy, which make fault diagnosis of analogy circuit on-line promising.",

So how to extract effective speech characters is very important for a speech recognition system to increase accuracy. The paper analyses speech feature extraction and improves it. The experiments indicate that the algorithm combination LDA+MLLT+CMS has a better robustness than other combinations. Average syllable recognition rate reach 43.88% by using it in conditions with noise. The algorithm combination has also a good performance in Mandarin Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (L VCSR). Syllable recognition accuracy achieves 83.68%.

The aim of this paper was to analyze the relationship between links and explore how they influence congestion propagation. Based on the existing Cell Transmission Model (CTM) theory, we had a lot of simulation under various circumstances through the program, in which the Average Journey Velocity (AJV) is selected as a measurement of the degree of link congestion. We established Link State Graph which is a directed network graph regarding links as nodes to observe the relationship between links. At last, we concluded how the location and adjacent links of a link can influence congestion propagation with the Link State Graph.",

        "abstract": "For some big cities where congestion occurs frequently, this paper proposes a novel predictive congestion control algorithm, focusing on imposing hard constraints on links for avoiding congestion. Traditionally the urban traffic network is often optimized with some micro-integrated global performance indexes, which equalize the effect of congestion and the emergency of congestion may be ignored. However, for cities with heavy congestion, more attentions should be directly paid to congestion avoidance which may be particularly sensitive for urban traffic managers and individual drivers. We use the universal standard of length of the queue to describe the congestion status of the link. Through simplifying the macroscopic urban traffic S model, we approximately get a linear relationship between signals and queue lengths such that we can predict the future congestion status of the links. Based on this, we transform the traditional optimization into formulating the urban traffic congestion control as a constraint satisfaction problem(CSP) where congestion avoidance conditions are imposed on the links and the problem can be characterized by finding the feasible solution for a group of linear inequalities. If the problem is non-feasible, we further develop a hierarchical strategy to guarantee the most important links without congestion. Simulation results show that the control approach significantly decreases the number of congested links compared to other controllers.",

However, lithium dendrite growth was a safety issue which handicapped the application of pure lithium metal in the negative electrode. In this investigation, two solvents, propylene carbonate (PC) and 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (2MeTHF), and four Li salts, LiPF, LiAsF, LiBF and LiClO were investigated in terms of their effects on the kinetics of lithium dendrite formation in eight electrolyte solutions. The kinetic parameters of charge transfer step (exchange current density, j, transfer coefficient, \u03b1) of Li/Li redox system, the mass transfer parameters of Li (transfer number of Li, t, diffusion coefficient of Li, D), and the conductivity (\u03ba) of each electrolyte were studied separately. The results demonstrate that the solvents play a critical role in the measured j, t, D, and \u03ba of the electrolyte, while the choice of Li salts only slightly affect the measured parameters. The understanding of the kinetics will gain insight into the mechanism of lithium dendrite formation and provide guidelines to the future application of lithium metal.",

        "abstract": "Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) has attracted significant attention as a safe, promising vector for immunotherapy. However, the precise effects of MVA infection on immune responses in humans remain largely unknown. We constructed recombinant MVA (rMVA) encoding both a human tumor-associated antigen (survivin) and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-2 and investigated their effects on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). The results showed that infection with rMVA slightly impaired the upregulation of CD83 and reduced the production of IL-10 in DCs after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. However, rMVA-infected DCs were still able to express high levels of target genes and the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 and to produce significant amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. Moreover, rMVA-infected DCs exhibited a greater capacity than uninfected cells to stimulate T-cell proliferation and to reverse MVA-induced apoptosis in syngeneic T cells. Coculture of lymphocytes with rMVA-infected DCs significantly increased cytotoxic potential and interferon gamma production by cytotoxic T cells. These findings suggest that rMVA encoding survivin and IL-2 can effectively stimulate the activation of human DCs and overcome defects such as impairment of DC maturation and apoptosis of lymphocytes that are caused by vector alone. Thus, this study may provide a rational basis for further optimization of MVA vector.",

        "abstract": "Few comparison studies have been carried out on patients with distal pancreatectomy (DP) combined with celiac axis (CA) resection. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of this extended procedure in treatment of advanced carcinoma of the body/tail of the pancreas.This was a retrospective analysis of 206 patients with carcinoma of the body/tail of the pancreas from January 2003 through June 2008. Patients were divided into three groups based on the relationship of tumor and CA/common hepatic artery (CHA) as well as different treatment strategies. Data for operation time, blood loss, complications, and survival time were collected and statistically analyzed.Sixty-five patients (31.6%) received radical distal pancreatectomy (DP), including 11 patients who underwent DP combined with celiac axis resection (group A) and 54 patients who received conventional DP (group B). Twenty patients did not undergo DP because of CA and/or CHA invasion only (group C). Group A had longer mean operative time than group B (323 versus 225 min, P = 0.000); there was no difference in mean estimated blood loss, percentage of pancreatic fistula or median survival time (14 versus 15 months, P = 0.197). However, group A had significantly prolonged median survival time compared with the 20 patients in group C (14 versus 5 months, P = 0.013), and quality of life was also dramatically improved.DP combined with CA resection can be safely performed in certain patients with carcinoma of body/tail of the pancreas and significantly improves patient survival and quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the association of passive hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR) with recovery of liver function and early biliary complications after liver transplantation. Methods: The early hepatic arterial flow and portal venous flow were monitored in 60 patients subject to liver transplantation before operation and 1 d and 2 d after operation, and HABR was evaluated. According to HABR findings, patients were divided into HABR group (HABR existence) and No-HABR group (HABR impairment). Based on results of liver function tests, B ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), the association of HABR with recovery of liver function and early biliary complications after liver transplantation was analysed. Results: There were 30 patients in HABR group and No-HABR group each. The time of recovery of liver function and duration of hospital stay in HABR group were significantly shorter than those in No-HABR group (P<0.05), and the liver function parameters of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBIL) in HABR group were better recovered (P<0.05). The prevalence of early biliary complications in HABR group was significantly lower than that in No-HABR group (P<0.05). Conclusion: HABR can be evaluated by monitoring of hepatic arterial flow and portal venous flow after liver transplantation, and the intact passive HABR may promote recovery of liver function and decrease the prevalence of early biliary complications.",

        "abstract": "Application features like port numbers are used by Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems NIDSs to detect attacks coming from networks. System calls and the operating system related information are used by Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems HIDSs to detect intrusions toward a host. However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and Denial-of-Service DoS attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this article, the authors identify the following hardware architecture features: Instruction Count, Cache Miss, Bus Traffic and integrate them into a HIDS framework based on a modern statistical Gradient Boosting Trees model. Through the integration of application, operating system and architecture level features, the proposed HIDS demonstrates a significant improvement of the detection rate in terms of sophisticated DoS intrusions.",

Using developmental, genetic and illness-based RNA sequencing expression analysis in human brain, we characterized the human brain transcriptome around these loci and found enrichment for developmentally regulated genes with novel examples of shifting isoform usage across pre- and postnatal life. We found widespread expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), including many with transcript specificity and previously unannotated sequence that were independently replicated. We leveraged this general eQTL database to show that 48.1% of risk variants for schizophrenia associate with nearby expression. We lastly found 237 genes significantly differentially expressed between patients and controls, which replicated in an independent dataset, implicated synaptic processes, and were strongly regulated in early development. These findings together offer genetics- and diagnosis-related targets for better modeling of schizophrenia risk. This resource is publicly available at http://eqtl.brainseq.org/phase1 .",

        "abstract": "Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is a major public health concern. While there are well-described consequences in early child development, there is very little known about the effects of maternal smoking on human cortical biology during prenatal life. We therefore performed a genome-wide differential gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on prenatal (N\u2009=\u200933; 16 smoking-exposed) as well as adult (N\u2009=\u2009207; 57 active smokers) human postmortem prefrontal cortices. Smoking exposure during the prenatal period was directly associated with differential expression of 14 genes; in contrast, during adulthood, despite a much larger sample size, only two genes showed significant differential expression (FDR\u2009<\u200910%). Moreover, 1,315 genes showed significantly different exposure effects between maternal smoking during pregnancy and direct exposure in adulthood (FDR\u2009<\u200910%)-these differences were largely driven by prenatal differences that were enriched for pathways previously implicated in addiction and synaptic function. Furthermore, prenatal and age-dependent differentially expressed genes were enriched for genes implicated in non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and were differentially expressed as a set between patients with ASD and controls in postmortem cortical regions. These results underscore the enhanced sensitivity to the biological effect of smoking exposure in the developing brain and offer insight into how maternal smoking during pregnancy affects gene expression in the prenatal human cortex. They also begin to address the relationship between in utero exposure to smoking and the heightened risks for the subsequent development of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "Differentiating pluripotent cells from fibroblast progenitors is a potentially transformative tool in personalized medicine. We previously identified relatively greater success culturing dura-derived fibroblasts than scalp-derived fibroblasts from postmortem tissue. We hypothesized that these differences in culture success were related to epigenetic differences between the cultured fibroblasts by sampling location, and therefore generated genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome data on 11 intrinsically matched pairs of dural and scalp fibroblasts from donors across the lifespan (infant to 85 years). While these cultured fibroblasts were several generations removed from the primary tissue and morphologically indistinguishable, we found widespread epigenetic differences by sampling location at the single CpG (N = 101,989), region (N = 697), \u201cblock\u201d (N = 243), and global spatial scales suggesting a strong epigenetic memory of original fibroblast location. Furthermore, many of these epigenetic differences manifested in the transcriptome, particularly at the region-level. We further identified 7,265 CpGs and 11 regions showing significant epigenetic memory related to the age of the donor, as well as an overall increased epigenetic variability, preferentially in scalp-derived fibroblasts\u201483% of loci were more variable in scalp, hypothesized to result from cumulative exposure to environmental stimuli in the primary tissue. By integrating publicly available DNA methylation datasets on individual cell populations in blood and brain, we identified significantly increased inter-individual variability in our scalp- and other skin-derived fibroblasts on a similar scale as epigenetic differences between different lineages of blood cells. Lastly, these epigenetic differences did not appear to be driven by somatic mutation\u2014while we identified 64 probable de-novo variants across the 11 subjects, there was no association between mutation burden and age of the donor (p = 0.71). These results depict a strong component of epigenetic memory in cell culture from primary tissue, even after several generations of daughter cells, related to cell state and donor age.",

        "abstract": "GWAS have identified over 108 loci that confer risk for schizophrenia, but risk mechanisms for individual loci are largely unknown. Using developmental, genetic, and illness-based RNA sequencing expression analysis, we characterized the human brain transcriptome around these loci and found enrichment for developmentally regulated genes with novel examples of shifting isoform usage across pre- and post-natal life. Within patients and controls, we implemented a novel algorithm for RNA quality adjustment, and identified 237 genes significantly associated with diagnosis that replicated in an independent case-control dataset. These genes implicated synaptic processes and were strongly regulated in early development (p u003c 10-20). Lastly, we found 42.5% of risk variants associate with nearby genes and diverse transcript features that converge on developmental regulation and subsequent dysregulation in illness and 34 loci show convergent directionality with illness association implicating specific causative transcripts. These data offer new targets for modeling schizophrenia risk in cellular systems.",

We show that the rate of DNAm changes more dramatically during the first five years of postnatal life than during the entire remaining period. We further refined global patterns of increasingly divergent neuronal CpG and CpH methylation (mCpG and mCpH) into six unique developmental trajectories, within which neighboring mC levels - independent of sequence context - were highly correlated, unlike across the genome, where mCpG levels were correlated but mCpH levels were not. We then integrated paired RNA-seq data and identified direct regulation of hundreds of transcripts and their splicing events exclusively by mCpH, independent of mCpG levels, across this period of human cortical development. In addition to expanding the relationship between mCpH and gene expression, these splicing-associated cytosines and developmentally dynamic DNAm regions were associated with neuropsychiatric disease risk sequence, providing insight into the cell type and timing of dynamic epigenomic remodeling in known disease risk genes and loci.",

        "abstract": "Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is a major public health concern. While there are well-described consequences in early child development, there is very little known about the effects of maternal smoking on human cortical biology during prenatal life. We therefore performed a genome-wide differential gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on prenatal (N\u2009=\u200933; 16 smoking-exposed) as well as adult (N\u2009=\u2009207; 57 active smokers) human postmortem prefrontal cortices. Smoking exposure during the prenatal period was directly associated with differential expression of 14 genes; in contrast, during adulthood, despite a much larger sample size, only two genes showed significant differential expression (FDR\u2009<\u200910%). Moreover, 1,315 genes showed significantly different exposure effects between maternal smoking during pregnancy and direct exposure in adulthood (FDR\u2009<\u200910%)-these differences were largely driven by prenatal differences that were enriched for pathways previously implicated in addiction and synaptic function. Furthermore, prenatal and age-dependent differentially expressed genes were enriched for genes implicated in non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and were differentially expressed as a set between patients with ASD and controls in postmortem cortical regions. These results underscore the enhanced sensitivity to the biological effect of smoking exposure in the developing brain and offer insight into how maternal smoking during pregnancy affects gene expression in the prenatal human cortex. They also begin to address the relationship between in utero exposure to smoking and the heightened risks for the subsequent development of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "Transcriptome compartmentalization by the nuclear membrane provides both stochastic and functional buffering of transcript activity in the cytoplasm and has recently been implicated in neurodegenerative disease processes. Although many mechanisms regulating transcript compartmentalization are also prevalent in brain development, the extent to which subcellular localization differs as the brain matures has yet to be addressed. To characterize the nuclear and cytoplasmic transcriptomes during brain development, we sequenced both RNA fractions from homogenate prenatal and adult human postmortem cortex using PolyA+ and RiboZero library preparation methods. We find that while many genes are differentially expressed by fraction and developmental expression changes are similarly detectable in nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA, the compartmented transcriptomes become more distinct as the brain matures, perhaps reflecting increased utilization of nuclear retention as a regulatory strategy in adult brain. We examined potential mechanisms of this developmental divergence including alternative splicing, RNA editing, nuclear pore composition, RNA binding protein motif enrichment, and RNA secondary structure. Intron retention is associated with greater nuclear abundance in a subset of transcripts, as is enrichment for several splicing factor binding motifs. Finally, we examined disease association with fraction-regulated gene sets and found nuclear-enriched genes were also preferentially enriched in gene sets associated with neurodevelopmental psychiatric diseases. These results suggest that although gene-level expression is globally comparable between fractions, nuclear retention of transcripts may play an underappreciated role in developmental regulation of gene expression in brain, particularly in genes whose dysregulation is related to neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "title": "OVEREXPRESSION OF MULTIPLE TRANSCRIPTS OF SNX19 (SORTING NEXIN 19) IN MULTIPLE BRAIN REGIONS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO SCHIZOPHRENIA RISK",
        "abstract": "Background  Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified many genomic loci associated with risk for schizophrenia, but unambiguous identification of specific risk genes has proved difficult. We investigated the 2 megabase genomic region flanking index SNP rs10791097, the 16th ranked SNP in the 2014 publication from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) GWAS for schizophrenia.    Methods  We performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on samples from human postmortem DLPFC, hippocampus, and caudate from the Lieber Institute Human Brain Repository (N=~495, of which 175 were patients diagnosed with schizophrenia). To detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), we tested for association between genotypes at regional GWAS schizophrenia risk variants and expressed features at the gene, exon, and junction levels under a simple additive genetic model.    Results  Dozens of PGC GWAS-significant markers in the region were strongly associated with expressed features in SNX19, with eQTL p values ranging from 3.06E-07 to 1.58E-44. In contrast, eleven other genes in the region produced much weaker results. A junction between exons 8 and 9 defined a canonical class of \u201cfull length\u201d SNX19 transcripts (junc8.9 at hg19 position chr11:130750702-130773149) which was only weakly associated with genetic risk. In contrast, the PGC index SNP rs10791097 was associated with expression of a rarer class of transcripts, defined by a junction between exons 8 and 10 (junc8.10, chr11:130749607-130773149), in DLPFC (eQTL p= 5.98E-26), hippocampus (p=1.04E-19), and caudate (p=6.87E-19), with the clinical risk allele (T) predicting greater expression. Many of the junc8.10 eQTLs were confirmed in both GTEx (multiple brain regions) and in the CommonMind Consortium (DLPFC) datasets. Of note, only 46% of the 495 postmortem DLPFC samples had junc8.10 read counts u003e 0.    Discussion  In addition, we found highly significant eQTLs across multiple brain regions involving 4 other expressed features: 1) a novel junction at position chr11:130765052-130773149, 2) a novel junction at chr11:130750702-130764497), 3) a known exon at chr11:130762646-130762954, and 4) a known exon at chr11:130763659-130763769. These 4 features defined 4 more independent classes of transcripts, each with the clinical risk alleles predicting greater expression.  Across 3 different brain regions, PGC GWAS risk genotypes were associated with expression levels of 5 classes of SNX19 protein coding transcripts. We suggest that a critical element of the molecular mechanism(s) of schizophrenia risk from this GWAS locus is likely to be over-expression in multiple brain regions of multiple SNX19 transcripts and proteins of diverse structure and function.",

        "abstract": "Genetic variation and early adverse environmental events work together to increase risk for schizophrenia. \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in adult mammalian brain, plays a major role in normal brain development, and has been strongly implicated in the pathobiology of schizophrenia. GABA synthesis is controlled by two glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) genes, GAD1 and GAD2, both of which produce a number of alternative transcripts. Genetic variants in the GAD1 gene are associated with increased risk for schizophrenia, and reduced expression of its major transcript in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). No consistent changes in GAD2 expression have been found in brains from patients with schizophrenia. In this work, with the use of RNA sequencing and PCR technologies, we confirmed and tracked the expression of an alternative truncated transcript of GAD2 (ENST00000428517) in human control DLPFC homogenates across lifespan besides the well-known full length transcript of GAD2. In addition, using quantitative RT-PCR, expression of GAD2 full length and truncated transcripts were measured in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. The expression of GAD2 full length transcript is decreased in the DLPFC of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, while GAD2 truncated transcript is increased in bipolar disorder patients but decreased in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, the patients with schizophrenia with completed suicide or positive nicotine exposure showed significantly higher expression of GAD2 full length transcript. Alternative transcripts of GAD2 may be important in the growth and development of GABA-synthesizing neurons as well as abnormal GABA signaling in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders.

        "title": "Detached eddy simulations for high speed axial flow fuel pumps with swept and straight blade impellers",
        "abstract": "PurposeHigh speed axial flow pumps are widely used in aircraft fuel systems. Conventional axial flow pumps often generate radial secondary flows at partial-load conditions which influence the flow structure and form a \u201csaddle-shaped\u201d region in the Q-H curve that can destabilize the operation. Thus, the \u201csaddle-shaped\u201d Q-H region must be eliminated. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachThe swept stacking method is often used for radial flow control in turbo-machinery impeller blade design. Hence, this study uses the swept stacking method to design a high speed axial flow pump. The detached eddy simulation method and experiments are used to compare the performance of a swept blade impeller in a high speed axial fuel pump with the original straight blade impeller. Both the pump performance and internal flow characteristics are studied.FindingsThe results show separation vortices in the impeller with the straight blade design at partial-load conditions that are driven by the rotating centrifugal force to gather near the shroud. The swept geometry provides an extra force which is opposite to the rotating centrifugal force that creates a new radial equilibrium which turns the flow back towards the middle of the blade which eliminates the vortices and the \u201csaddle-shaped\u201d Q-H region. The swept blade impeller also improves the critical cavitation performance. Analysis of the pressure pulsations shows that the swept blade design does not affect the stability.Originality/valueThis study is the initial application of swept blades for axial flow liquid pumps. The results show how the swept stacking changes the radial equilibrium of the high density, high viscosity flow and the effects on the mass transfer and pressure pulsations. The swept blade effectively improves the operating stability of high speed fuel pumps.",

        "abstract": "In fluid machineries, the flow energy dissipates by transforming into internal energy which performs as the temperature changes. The flow-induced noise is another form that flow energy turns into. These energy dissipations are related to the local flow regime but this is not quantitatively clear. In turbomachineries, the flow regime becomes pulsating and much more complex due to rotor-stator interaction. To quantitatively understand the energy dissipations during rotor-stator interaction, the centrifugal air pump with a vaned diffuser is studied based on total energy modeling, turbulence modeling and acoustic analogy method. The numerical method is verified based on experimental data and applied to further simulation and analysis. The diffuser blade leading-edge site is under the influence of impeller trailing-edge wake. The diffuser channel flow is found periodically fluctuating with separations from the blade convex side. Stall vortex is found on the diffuser blade trailing-edge near outlet. High energy loss coefficient sites are found in the undesirable flow regions above. Flow-induced noise is also high in these sites except in the stall vortex. Frequency analyses show that the impeller blade frequency dominates in the diffuser channel flow except in the outlet stall vortexes. These stall vortices keep their own stall frequency which is about 1/5 impeller frequency with high energy loss coefficient but low noise level. Results comparatively prove the energy dissipation mechanism in the centrifugal air pump under rotor-stator interaction. Results also provide the quantitative basis for turbomachinery\u2019s loss reduction design.",

        "abstract": "Double-suction centrifugal pumps play an important role in the main feedwater systems of nuclear power plant. The impeller radial force in a centrifugal pump varies dramatically during startup at the shut-off condition. In this study, the startup process of a large double-suction centrifugal pump is investigated using CFD. During testing, the impeller speed is accelerated from zero to its rated speed in 1.0 s (marked as t0) and is then maintained at the rated speed. The results show that the radial force increase lags behind the impeller speed increase. At 0\u20130.4t0, the radial force is small (approaching zero). At 0.4\u20131.4t0, the radial force increases rapidly. After 1.4t0, the average radial force stabilizes and reaches its maximum value of 55,619 N. The observed maximum radial force value during startup is approximately nine times as high as the radial force under rated condition. During startup, the overall radial force direction is proximate to the radial line located 25\u00b0 from the volute tongue along circumferential direction. A transient radial force formula is proposed to evaluate the changes in radial force during startup. The streamline distribution in impeller passages and the impeller outlet pressure profile varying over time are produced. The relationship between radial force evolution and the varying axial-to-spiral vortex structure is analyzed. The radial force change mechanism is revealed. This research provides a scientific basis for startup control in large double-suction centrifugal pumps.",

In this study, CFD simulations based on the detached eddy simulation method were used to study the flow characteristics in the pump. The overall performance, the pressure pulsations and the forces on the impeller are studied in detail. The predicted pump head and efficiency agree well with experimental data around the design flow condition even though undesirable flow is found in the guide vanes and circular volute. However, the CFD simulations did not correctly predict the pressure pulsation frequency even for the design flow condition. The experiments showed pressure pulsations at 50\u202fHz and at multiples of 50\u202fHz that were not predicted in the CFD simulation. After a small eccentricity was added to the impeller in the simulation, the 50\u202fHz pulsation was then captured with each impeller revolution in the CFD simulations at multiple pressure pulsation monitoring points. The amplitudes of the 50\u202fHz frequency and its multiples increase with the impeller eccentricity. Thus, the impeller eccentricity influences the pressure pulsations and the axial and radial forces. The impeller eccentricity has an important effect on the operating stability and security of the main pump. In addition, simulations must consider the impeller eccentricity for accurate analyses of the main pump in nuclear power plants.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cavitation is an important issue of reversible pump-turbines especially in the pump mode. It usually causes noise, vibration, material-damage and operation stability on the pump-turbine unit. To diminish the bad influences of cavitation, the cavitation behavior in the pump mode of a pump-turbine is experimentally and numerically investigated. Results show that the best range of inception cavitation number and the best range of critical cavitation number have no intersection. Influenced by the incidence angle on the leading edge, the best inception cavitation range occurs around the impeller design condition. However, the best critical cavitation range is found at partial-load. To find a proper cavitation criterion, the development of cavitation is studied in detail. The relationship among the critical cavitation, the vapor volume and the fluid volume below the vaporization pressure is analyzed. At partial-load, cavitation incepts at a higher cavitation number than under the impeller design condition. During the cavitation number\u2019s decreasing, the vapor volume under impeller design condition transcend it at partial-load. Finally, the impeller design condition has a higher critical cavitation number than the partial-load. Considering the existing cavitation before critical cavitation, the inception cavitation standard is strongly recommended for the pump-turbine and other high-energy hydraulic turbomachineries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In reversible pump-turbines at pump mode, local flow separation on the leading-edge overlaps the impelleru0027s low-pressure side and causes a sudden pressure-drop. Hence, cavitation easily incepts on leading-edge especially at off-design conditions. To solve this cavitation problem, a NACA0006 profile was used as a simplified model of pump-turbine impeller blade to understand the cavitation inception mechanism. Numerical results indicate multiple favorable-pressure-gradients, which were caused by the quickly-varied geometry, on the hydrofoil surface. The minimum pressure occurs in one of these gradientsu0027 region and usually locates around leading-edge because of the quickly-varied geometry of leading-edge arc. Then, Diffusion-angle Integral design method was developed to design the blade leading-edge shape. It has only three design parameters by effective geometry deconstruction. Based on orthogonal test, the reasonable values of design parameters can be determined. With optimal design parameters, the NACA0006 foil and pump-turbine impeller blade were completely redesigned and improved. The inception cavitation number of the redesigned foil was obviously reduced especially at large incidence angles. The redesigned pump-turbine also has a reduced inception cavitation number and delayed cavitation inception especially at off-design conditions. The design concept, method and application in this study provide useful reference for anti-inception-cavitation design of turbomachinery blades.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum diselenide nanosheet/carbon nanofiber (MoSe/CNF) heterojunctions have been successfully obtained by a facile two-step synthesis route combining an electrospinning technique and solvothermal method. The results show that MoSe nanosheets distributed evenly on the carbon nanofibers without aggregation, and the loading amount of MoSe could be well controlled by adjusting the reactant concentrations during the solvothermal process for the fabrication of the MoSe/CNF heterojunctions. The as-prepared MoSe/CNF heterojunctions exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than pure MoSe for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible and infrared light irradiation. The normalized rate constant for the MoSe/CNF heterojunctions was nearly 3.2 times and 1.6 times higher than that of pure MoSe under visible light and infrared light (1.5\u202fW, 980\u202fnm laser) irradiation, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity might be attributed to the formation of heterojunctions, which could improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes at the MoSe/CNF heterojunctions interface. In addition, MoSe/CNF heterojunctions could be efficiently separated from the solution by sedimentation due to their ultralong one-dimensional and self-supporting structure. Such MoSe/CNF heterojunctions with a broad-spectrum-response photocatalytic performance might have potential applications in water treatment.",

The loading amount of BiMoO in the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction nanofibers could be controlled by adjusting the precursor concentrations in the solvothermal process. The XPS analysis, energy band position calculation and trapping experiments all proved that the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction is a Z-scheme heterojunction. The Z-scheme BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction had a much higher photocatalytic activity in the visible-light photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) than pure BiFeO nanofibers or pure BiMoO nanosheets. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the formation of Z-scheme BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunctions, which could be beneficial to the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction nanofibers could be easily separated under an external magnetic field via the ferromagnetic BiFeO. After several cycles, the photocatalytic activity of the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction no longer significantly decreased suggesting that the BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction is stable. These Z-scheme BiMoO/BiFeO heterojunction nanofibers with highly visible-light photocatalytic activity, excellent chemical stability and magnetic separability could be useful in many practical applications.",

The H\u2013N\u2013CNF/MoSe2 heterojunctions presented a photocatalytic performance that was much better than that of the CNF/MoSe2 heterojunctions and MoSe2 for the degradation of different polluants under full-spectrum irradiation. The band bending of the heterojunction was studied by XPS analysis, and the nitrogen-doping effects on their conductivity were investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectra. Photocurrent measurements and electron spin resonance data confirmed their improved charge separation and the enhanced ability for generating active species of \u2022O2\u2013 and \u2022OH. Furthermore, the H\u2013N\u2013CNF/MoSe2 heterojunctions with unique self-supporting structure can easily be reus...",

        "abstract": "Rational construction of heterostructures (especially p-n heterostructures) is an excellent strategy for efficient charge separation and desirable photocatalytic performance. Regretfully, the measurements of charge separation efficiency of p-n heterojunction are often monotonous. In this paper, a well-designed p-CuAl2O4/n-Bi2MoO6 heterojunction was successfully synthesized by assembling Bi2MoO6 nanosheets (NSs) on the electrospun CuAl2O4 hollow nanofibers (HNFs) through a solvothermal method. The Bi2MoO6 NSs tightly connect with CuAl2O4 HNFs via strong chemical bonding, and the loading amount can be easily controlled by the concentration of precursor. Significantly, for the first time the charge separation efficiency of the heterojunction is systematically investigated via its photoelectrochemical responses under visible light irradiation with and without trapping agents, and the highly efficient charge separation and transfer of the heterojunction is tightly confirmed.

        "abstract": "In the previous study, we established a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy using transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and found that the expression of long non-coding RNAs TINCR was downregulated in myocardial tissue. The present study was designed to determine the potential role of TINCR in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Our results showed that enforced expression of TINCR could attenuate cardiac hypertrophy in TAC mice. Angiotensin II (Ang-II) was found to be associated with reduced TINCR expression and increased hypertrophy in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that TINCR could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that EZH2 could directly bind to CaMKII promoter region and mediate H3K27me3 modification. Knockdown of TINCR was found to reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of CaMKII in cardiomyocytes. In addition, enforced expression of TINCR was found to decrease CaMKII expression and attenuate Ang-II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Furthermore, our results also showed that Ang-II could increase CaMKII expression in cardiomyocytes, which consequently contributed to cellular hypertrophy. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that TINCR could attenuate myocardial hypertrophy by epigenetically silencing of CaMKII, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for cardiac hypertrophy.",

Despite aggressive therapy, many patients succumb to the disease, and survivors experience severe side effects from treatment.  MYC -driven MB has a particularly poor prognosis and would greatly benefit from more effective therapies. We used an animal model of  MYC -driven MB to screen for drugs that decrease viability of tumor cells. Among the most effective compounds were histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs). HDACIs potently inhibit survival of  MYC -driven MB cells in\u00a0vitro, in part by inducing expression of the  FOXO1  tumor suppressor gene. HDACIs also synergize with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors to inhibit tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. These studies identify an effective combination therapy for the most aggressive form of MB.",

        "abstract": "Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Although surgery, radiation and high-dose chemotherapy have led to increased survival rates, many patients still die from their disease and those who survive often suffer severe long-term side effects. Group 3 MB is the most aggressive subtype of MB, which is often resistant to therapy, and patients with this tumor have an extremely poor prognosis. Thus, developing novel and more effective therapeutic approaches is desperately needed for treating this disease. Improved approaches are likely to come from a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of the disease. Group 3 MB is characterized by large cell/anaplastic histology with a high proliferative index and is associated with MYC amplification or overexpression. Our previous studies suggest that MYC-driven MB can be generated by infecting granule neuron progenitors (GNPs, Math1+) or neonatal cerebellar stem cells/progenitors (CD133+) with viruses encoding MYC and dominant negative p53 (DNp53) and transplanting these cells into the cerebella of immunocompromised mice (NSG). Although this model resembles Group 3 MB in terms of histology and gene expression, it most likely does not faithfully recapitulate human MB because mutation and deletion of p53 are rarely detected in human Group 3 MB at diagnosis. This observation prompted us to ask whether there might be a cell type in which the MYC oncogene alone is sufficient to induce MB. Sox2 expression has been found in neural stem cell/progenitor cells in cerebellum. Moreover, it has been reported that ~70% human Group 3 MB express Sox2, and that its expression is correlated with poor prognosis. Thus we hypothesize that Sox2-positive cells with MYC overexpression can develop tumors. We FACS-sorted Sox2 GFP -positive or Sox2 GFP -negative cells from Sox2 -GFP  mice at P5, infected these cells with MYC virus and transplanted them into the cerebella of NSG mice. Animals (n=10) receiving Sox2-positive cells developed highly aggressive tumors and had to be sacrificed within 3-6 weeks. In contrast, only one of the animals (n=10) that received Sox2-negative cells developed a tumor at 8 weeks. These results suggest that the MYC oncogene alone is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in Sox2-positive cells, without requiring loss of p53. Further studies demonstrate that the tumors that were generated from Sox2-positive cells resemble Group 3 MB at a histological, immunohistochemical and molecular level, indicating that Group 3 MB may originate from Sox2-positive cells during cerebellar development. We will use this model to investigate the mechanisms that make these cells sensitive to transformation. These studies will pave the way for the development of novel approaches to treating this devastating tumor.   Citation Format:  Ran Tao, Najiba Murad, Zhenhua Xu, Yanxin Pei.

Here, we showed that astrocyte progenitors in the early postnatal cerebellum were susceptible to transformation by MYC. The resulting tumors specifically resembled human Group 3 medulloblastoma based on histology and gene expression profiling. Gene expression analysis of MYC-driven medulloblastoma cells revealed altered glucose metabolic pathways with marked overexpression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). LDHA abundance correlated positively with MYC expression and was associated with poor prognosis in human Group 3 medulloblastoma. Inhibition of LDHA significantly reduced growth of both mouse and human MYC-driven tumors but had little effect on normal cerebellar cells or SHH-associated medulloblastoma. By generating a new mouse model, we demonstrated for the first time that astrocyte progenitors can be transformed by MYC and serve as the cells of origin for Group 3 medulloblastoma. Moreover, we identified LDHA as a novel, specific therapeutic target for this devastating disease.",

Here, we show that single-cell heterogeneity analysis may overcome this hurdle by significantly improving the test sensitivity. We analyzed the transcriptome of 39,905 single islets cells from 9 donors and observed distinct \u03b2 cell heterogeneity trajectories associated with obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D). We therefore developed RePACT, a sensitive single-cell analysis algorithm to identify both common and specific signature genes for obesity and T2D. We mapped both \u03b2-cell-specific genes and disease signature genes to the insulin regulatory network identified from a genome-wide CRISPR screen. Our integrative analysis discovered the previously unrecognized roles of the cohesin loading complex and the NuA4/Tip60 histone acetyltransferase complex in regulating insulin transcription and release. Our study demonstrated the power of combining single-cell heterogeneity analysis and functional genomics to dissect the etiology of complex diseases.",

        "abstract": "A large-grained perovskite film, with a crystal grain size of ca. 30-50 \u03bcm, was achieved by polyoxometalate-induced Ostwald ripening. Aiming at commercially-oriented fully printable hole-conductor-free perovskite solar cells, the power conversion efficiency of the device was significantly improved from 9.17% to 11.35% (average) via polyoxometalate molecular doping. This is because the large-grained perovskite film could effectively reduce bulk defects and charge recombination, thereby facilitating charge transport.",

To our knowledge, compound  1  is the first example of inorganic-organic hybrid based on both polyoxometalate and isoniazid. In compound  1 , twelve surface oxygen atoms of [VMo 7 O 26 ] 5\u2212  cluster are utilized to make coordination linkage with other components; creating the highest coordination connection in molybdovanadates subfamily. Interestingly, the in situ isoniazid dimerization reaction could occur during the synthesis process, and then the in situ generated isoniazid dimer could function as a linker to join the coordination assembly of 3D architecture. Furthermore, the semiconducting property of compound  1  was investigated by photophysical measurements, demonstrating the characteristics of n-type semiconductor.",

In this work, we develop an efficient electron transport layer material SnO 2 -PMo 12  composite for the fully printable hole transport material (HTM)-free PSCs, in which PMo 12  denotes the Keggin-type polyoxometalate H 3 PMo 12 O 40 . Benefitting from the synergistic effect of polyoxometalates, SnO 2 -PMo 12  shows enhanced electron mobility, faster electron extraction and proper downward shift of the conduction band minimum, which boosts the injection and transfer of electrons from the perovskite to the ETL and effectively suppresses charge recombination. In addition, the hysteresis-free behavior appears in the SnO 2 -PMo 12  device, suggesting a remarkable improvement in photovoltaic performance and device stability. Compared to the conventional TiO 2  ETL, the average power conversion efficiency of the device with SnO 2 -PMo 12  ETL is boosted from 10.1% to 12.6%. This work brings a new insight into the promoting photovoltaic performance and stability of the fully printable HTM-free PSCs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, in-situ 5\u00a0wt % Al 3 Zr/60063Al composites were fabricated by direct melt reaction method and subjected to forging and friction stir processing (FSP) to achieve high-strain-rate superplasticity of the composites. Analysis determination technics of XRD, OM, SEM, TEM and high-temperature tensile tests were employed to study the microstructure, superplasticity property and deformation mechanism of the fabricated composites. The results show that the average grain size of the fabricated composites is less than 2\u00a0\u03bcm after the processing of forging and FSP. And the composites exhibited superplasticity at the temperature of 400\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013550\u00a0\u00b0C with initial strain rate of 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 \u00a0s \u22121  to 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22121 \u00a0s \u22121 . Especially, the elongation could reach the maximum value of 330%, with a strain rate sensitive exponent ( m ) of 0.45, initial strain rate of 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22122 \u00a0s \u22121  and deformation temperature of 500\u00a0\u00b0C. Meanwhile, the strain rate sensitivity exponent was calculated to be 0.29\u20130.45 and the activation energy was 99.51\u2013121.28\u00a0kJ/mol, which indicates that the key deformation mechanism of the composites was grain boundary sliding (GBS) accommodated by dislocation slip. Furthermore, the structure analysis of the composites shows that the FSP composites exhibits higher dislocation density (1.42\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 15 \u00a0m \u22122 ) than the as-cast composites (6.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 14 \u00a0m \u22122 ), which is benefit to the dislocation slip and grain coarsening, i.e. a useful softening mechanism of the composites to avoid quick work hardening during the high-strain-rate deformation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, the effects of Er addition on the microstructure and properties of in situ nano A356-3 wt%ZrB 2  composites were investigated. The A356-3 wt%ZrB 2  composite was prepared by an in situ reaction between K 2 ZrF 6  and KBF 4  salts, which were added in the proper stoichiometric ratio to form ZrB 2  in the A356.2 alloy melt at 1123\u00a0K(850\u00a0\u00b0C). The addition of Er could modify the coarse lamellar eutectic Si particles into fine fibrous particles and refine the second dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) of the grains simultaneously. Furthermore, the Er also influenced the distribution and size of the ZrB 2  particles by homogenizing the distribution of the nanoparticles and reducing their size. Tensile testing showed that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS) and elongation increased to 325\u00a0MPa, 250MPa and 13.65%, respectively, due to the homogeneous distribution of the nanoparticles, the refinement of the SDAS of the \u03b1-Al grains and the modification of the eutectic Si particles upon increasing the Er content to 0.05\u00a0wt% combined with T6 heat treatment.",

The maximum ultimate tensile strength was approximately 361\u2009MPa, with a yield strength of 323\u2009MPa and an elongation of 3.6%, which constitute increases of 31.3%, 28.7% and 44% when compared to the 7055Al alloy, respectively.

The results indicated that with increase in the magnetic frequency and ultrasonic power to 10\u202fHz and 1.5\u202fkW, respectively, the large particle clusters were broken into smaller clusters that were uniformly distributed in the matrix, the distribution of the ZrB 2  nanoparticles was diffuse and homogeneous with a size decreased to 10\u201380\u202fnm, and the corners of the nanoparticles clearly became obtuse. The optimal ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS) and elongation (El) of the composite prepared under the coupled field were 363\u202fMPa, 240\u202fMPa and 24.1%, respectively, corresponding to increases of 36.6%, 55.5% and 64% over the respective properties of the AA6111 alloy.

With increasing rolling reduction, smaller clusters that consisted of many finer spherical ZrB 2  nanoparticles were uniformly distributed along the rolling direction (RD). In addition, the uniform distribution and smaller ZrB 2  particle accelerated the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) process to further refine the dynamically recrystallized (DRXed) grains. During the hot rolling process, the tensile properties increased with increasing reduction ratio. Tensile tests showed that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS) and elongation (El) increased to 356\u202fMPa, 289\u202fMPa and 28.1%, respectively, due to the uniform distribution of the particle clusters, the smaller size of the nanoparticles, and the refinement of the DRXed grains upon increasing the rolling reduction to 80%, in combination with T4 heat treatment and artificial ageing. In addition, the mechanisms of particle dispersion, recrystallization grain refinement and strengthening are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), which is completely biodegradable, is considered a potential candidate to replace a number of petroleum-derived polymers due to similar mechanical properties. In a previous study, inactivation of ndh gene in E. coli, which encodes the NDH-II dehydrogenase, resulted in significantly increased PHB production from either glucose or xylose as substrate.RESULTSIn this study, the xylose isomerase (EC:5.3.1.5), xylulokinase (EC:2.7.1.17) and the arabinose/xylose transport protein from Bacillus subtilis 168 (encoded by xylA, xylB and araE, respectively) were co-expressed in the ndh knockout strain, E. coli LJ03(pBHR68), which harbors the PHB biosynthesis genes from Ralstonia eutropha. The resulting strain E. coli LJ03(pBHR68+pM-ABE) was able to simultaneously utilize glucose and xylose to accumulate PHB. In flask cultivation, 3.67\u2009g\u2009L\u22121 PHB was produced from a glucose\u2013xylose mixture (10\u2009g\u2009L\u22121 glucose and 5\u2009g\u2009L\u22121 xylose), which was 2.09-fold higher than the production of the control strain E. coli JM109(pBHR68+pM-ABE). Ultimately, PHB production in fed-batch fermentation reached a maximum titer of 21.0\u2009g\u2009L\u22121, representing a 1.93-fold increase relative to the control strain.CONCLUSIONResults indicated that the engineered E. coli LJ03 strain is significantly more efficient than the parent strain E. coli JM109 in producing PHB from mixed glucose\u2013xylose feedstock. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing the implementation of an exogenous xylose utilization pathway in E. coli for the production of PHB from mixed glucose\u2013xylose feedstock\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a model of lignocellulosic hydrolysate. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",

        "abstract": "Acetoin is a high-value-added industrial product and a promising bio-based platform chemical. The two chiral enantiomers of acetoin are important potential pharmaceutical intermediates. However, at present it is very expensive to produce optically pure acetoin using conventional chemical synthesis methods. While classical biocatalysis fulfils many key criteria of green chemistry, it also comes with many other disadvantages, e.g. complicated process engineering, the need for expensive substrates and/or inducers, problematic production strains, or unsatisfactory titers. By redirecting metabolic fluxes, fine-tuning the activities of key enzymes and improving the strains\u2019 genetic stability, the systematically engineered strain CGR5 was constructed, which offered improved D-(\u2212)-acetoin production with optical purity surpassing 99.9%. Furthermore, acetoin production was increased significantly by the optimization of dissolved oxygen levels and culture medium components. Under aerobic conditions, the best strain CGR7 produced 96.2 g L\u22121D-(\u2212)-acetoin, with a productivity of 1.30 g (L h)\u22121 in a 5 L batch fermenter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on producing optically pure D-(\u2212)-acetoin with the highest titer, without multi-stage fermentation, concentration of cells by centrifugation or other complicated process steps. The process therefore is efficient and environmentally friendly. These results furthermore demonstrate that the biosafety level 1 microorganism C. glutamicum is a competitive choice for industrial-level production of optically pure D-(\u2212)-acetoin.",

In sum, 162 of the 167 patients without PD and 162 of the 309 patients with PD were enrolled after propensity score matching. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics were compared between the two groups. Kaplan-Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazards model were used to assess the factors associated with 10-week mortality. In total, approximately 35.1% of CM patients were without PD. CM patients without PD had blood profiles of higher white blood cells (WBC) [8.9(6.7-11.0) \u00d7 109/l], hemoglobin (128.4 \u00b1 20.9\u00a0g/l), platelets [(226.2 \u00b1 64.1) \u00d7 109/l], and serum albumin (41.2 \u00b1 5.8\u00a0g/l) (all P \u2264 .001) and CSF profiles of lower glucose (2.0 \u00b1 1.2\u00a0mmol/l), pleocytosis [65.0 (18.0-160.0) \u00d7 106/l] and higher total protein [0.9 (0.7-1.4)g/l] (all P < .05). CM patients without PD had lower Cryptococcus culture positivity in CSF (62.5%\u00a0vs. 74.1%, P = .039) but higher 2-week of CSF culture sterilization rates (69.4%\u00a0vs. 51.3%, P = .031). The overall 10-week survival rate was 84.7% in patients without PD and 81.1% in patients with PD (Log-rank P = .439). CSF glucose <1.5\u00a0mmol/l, CSF fungal burden >20 cells/high power field and treatment lacking amphotericin B had a 3-4 times higher risk of death in patients without PD, whereas serum albumin <35\u00a0g/l, CSF glucose < 1.5\u00a0mmol/l, and CSF WBC <55 \u00d7 106 cell/l were risk factors for patients with PD. CM patients without PD had unique blood and CSF profiles, especially, had lower Cryptococcus culture positivity in CSF, and higher 2-week CSF culture sterilization. Low CSF glucose levels, higher fungal burden, and treatment without amphotericin B were risk factors for 10-week mortality.",

For this reason, we propose a method based on the traditional FP-Growth algorithm and Word2Vec model to extract product features from online Chinese reviews in the clothing field. This paper has two contributions. One is to add semantic similarity calculation to avoid low-frequency feature words being deleted in the first step of FP-Growth algorithm. The other is to construct semantic rules to extract latent product features, which makes up the deficiency of the traditional association rule algorithm. An experiment is run for the data set of Chinese reviews on clothing products, which shows that the proposed method can improve the accuracy rate without affecting the recall rate.",

The conversion of three-color representations by PANTONE, RGB and HSV is suitable for computer processing. On the basis of defining the space constraints of color expansion in each color type, we use color similarity calculation for color expansion. The computer programming simulation experiment shows that each color type is regular on the three dimensions of the RGB color space. Under experimental conditions, a single basic color case can expand to 300 similar colors, and the expansion results can be sorted according to the color similarity. The color similarity calculation method introduced in this paper can avoid the weakness of RGB color space inhomogeneous, and the calculation is simple. The method conforms to the rule of visual similarity judgment which is adapted to the expertu0027s recommendation.",

        "abstract": "Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) has recently been identified as a host restriction factor that exerts antiviral effects by catalyzing the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). CH25H can be rapidly induced upon infection with some viruses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus, has ranked among the most important swine pathogens since it was discovered in the late 1980s. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection significantly downregulated the expression of CH25H in cells by a so-far unknown mechanism, suggesting that CH25H exerts antiviral activity against PRRSV. Indeed, overexpression of CH25H inhibited PRRSV replication, whereas knockdown of CH25H by short interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted PRRSV infection. The anti-PRRSV effect of 25HC operates via inhibition of viral penetration. Interestingly, a CH25H mutant (CH25H-M) lacking hydroxylase activity still inhibited PRRSV infection. Screening using a yeast two-hybrid system followed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence colocalization analyses confirmed that both CH25H and CH25H-M interact with the nonstructural protein 1 alpha (nsp1\u03b1) of PRRSV. Unexpectedly, the expression of nsp1\u03b1 decreased following coexpression with CH25H or CH25H-M. Detailed analyses demonstrated that CH25H/CH25H-M could degrade nsp1\u03b1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that site K169 in the nsp1\u03b1 protein is the key site of ubiquitination. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CH25H restricts PRRSV replication by targeting viral penetration as well as degrading nsp1\u03b1, revealing a novel antiviral mechanism used by CH25H. PRRSV has been a continuous threat to the global swine industry, and current vaccines are insufficient to provide sustainable control. CH25H has been found to exert a broad antiviral effect; thus, it is an attractive target for the development of anti-PRRSV drugs. Here, we demonstrate that CH25H is an interferon-stimulated gene that is highly expressed in porcine alveolar macrophages. CH25H exerts its anti-PRRSV effect not only via the production of 25HC to inhibit viral penetration but also by degrading viral protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suggesting that CH25H is a candidate for the development of antiviral therapeutics. However, PRRSV infection appears to actively decrease CH25H expression to promote viral replication, highlighting the complex game between PRRSV and its host.",

        "abstract": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an  that has caused tremendous economic losses in the global swine industry since it was discovered in the late 1980s. Inducing host translation shutoff is a strategy used by many viruses to optimize their replication and spread. Here, we demonstrate that PRRSV infection causes host translation suppression, which is strongly dependent on viral replication. By screening PRRSV-encoded nonstructural proteins (nsps), we found that nsp2 participates in the induction of host translation shutoff and that its transmembrane (TM) domain is required for this process. Nsp2-induced translation suppression is independent of protein degradation pathways and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1). However, the overexpression of nsp2 or its TM domain significantly attenuated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, an alternative pathway for modulating host gene expression. PRRSV infection also attenuated the mTOR signaling pathway, and PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff could be partly reversed when the attenuated mTOR phosphorylation was reactivated by an activator of the mTOR pathway. PRRSV infection still negatively regulated the host translation when the effects of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation were completely reversed. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PRRSV infection induces host translation shutoff and that nsp2 is associated with this process. Both eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and the attenuation of the mTOR signaling pathway contribute to PRRSV-induced host translation arrest. Viruses are obligate parasites, and the production of progeny viruses relies strictly on the host translation machinery. Therefore, the efficient modulation of host mRNA translation benefits viral replication, spread, and evolution. In this study, we provide evidence that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection induces host translation shutoff and that the viral nonstructural protein nsp2 is associated with this process. Many viruses induce host translation shutoff by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1). However, PRRSV nsp2 does not induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation but attenuates the mTOR signaling pathway, another pathway regulating the host cell translational machinery. We also found that PRRSV-induced host translation shutoff was partly reversed by dephosphorylating eIF2\u03b1 or reactivating the mTOR pathway, indicating that PRRSV infection induces both eIF2\u03b1-phosphorylation-dependent and -independent host translation shutoff.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most significant etiological agents in pigs, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has adversely impacted the global swine industry since it was discovered in the 1980s. The mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (DCP1a), a regulatory factor involved in removing the 5'-methylguanosine cap from eukaryotic mRNA, has recently been identified as an IFN-stimulated gene. However, the role of DCP1a in PRRSV infection is not well understood. In this study, overexpression and knockdown of porcine DCP1a (pDCP1a) showed that pDCP1a affected PRRSV infection. Interestingly, we found that PRRSV infection significantly downregulated pDCP1a expression at the protein level by cleaving pDCP1a. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PRRSV nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4), a 3C-like proteinase, is responsible for pDCP1a cleavage, and the cleaved site is at glutamic acid 238 (E238) of pDCP1a. The mutant pDCP1a-E238A, which cannot be cleaved by nsp4, showed higher anti-PRRSV activity, and the antiviral effects of two cleavage products (pDCP1a and pDCP1a) were significantly decreased compared with wild type pDCP1a. Unexpectedly, PRRSV infection or overexpression of nsp4 did not cleave monkey DCP1a, and monkey DCP1a showed a higher anti-PRRSV activity than pDCP1a. Taken together, this study reveals a new strategy evolved by PRRSV to dampen the host defense, complementing the known PRRSV-mediated immune evasion mechanisms.",

GBP-TiO-FA-CS-NPs at low TiO concentration (from 1 to 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) showed good inhibition capacity on HepG2 cells and low cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on HL-7702 cells. The possible mechanism of cytotoxicity on GBP-TiO-FA-CS-NPs against HepG2 cells is by preventing excessive intracellular Ca into extracellular spaces via inhibiting Ca-ATPase and Ca/Mg-ATPase.",

        "abstract": "Three series of novel urushiol derivatives were designed by introducing a hydroxamic acid moiety into the tail of an alkyl side chain and substituents with differing electronic properties or steric bulk onto the benzene ring and alkyl side chain. The compounds' binding affinity toward HDAC8 was screened by Glide docking. The highest-scoring compounds were processed further with molecular docking, MD simulations, and binding free energy studies to analyze the binding modes and mechanisms. Ten compounds had Glide scores of -8.2 to -10.2, which revealed that introducing hydroxy, carbonyl, amino, or methyl ether groups into the alkyl side chain or addition of -F, -Cl, sulfonamide, benzamido, amino, or hydroxy substituents on the benzene ring could significantly increase binding affinity. Molecular docking studies revealed that zinc ion coordination, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions contributed to the high calculated binding affinities of these compounds toward HDAC8. MD simulations and binding free energy studies showed that all complexes possessed good stability, as characterized by low RMSDs, low RMSFs of residues, moderate hydrogen bonding and zinc ion coordination and low values of binding free energies. Hie147, Tyr121, Phe175, Hip110, Phe119, Tyr273, Lys21, Gly118, Gln230, Leu122, Gly269, and Gly107 contributed favorably to the binding; and Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions provided major contributions to the stability of these complexes. These results show the potential of urushiol derivatives as HDAC8 binding lead compounds, which have great therapeutic potential in the treatment of various malignancies, neurological disorders, and human parasitic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment on the structural, allergenicity and functional properties of ginkgo seed protein (GSP) were investigated. GSP was treated under pressures of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700\u00a0MPa. Western blotting and ELISA assay revealed that HHP treatment at pressure ranges from 300 up to 700\u00a0MPa can significantly reduce the allergenicity of GSP. Meanwhile, SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF-MS, CD spectra, fluorescence spectra and UV absorption spectra analysis revealed that, after HHP treatment, the GSP disintegrated into proteins with small molecular weights ranging from 4 to 30\u00a0kDa; the secondary structures of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheet were largely destroyed and turned into random coil; and the UV absorption intensity, surface hydrophobicity and sulfhydryl group (SH) content of GSP were significantly increased. Moreover, the HHP-treated GSP showed markedly improved heat stability and emulsifying properties compared to the untreated GSP.    Industrial relevance  As a traditional food and medicine source, the seeds of  Ginkgo biloba  were used in china for several thousand years. Ginkgo seeds could be added to desserts, glazed fruit, beverages and tipple, also ginkgo seeds, as a traditional Chinese medicinal material, have been recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medical. Research shows that ginkgo seeds have a relatively high content (10%\u201315%) of proteins, which possess rich and reasonable composition of amino acids, and much higher content of essential amino acids than the recommended FAO/WHO standard, belonging to the high-quality protein. Ginkgo seeds proteins (GSP) have many biological activities, including anti-oxidation, anti-aging, anti-tumor, and anti-bacterial, so it has high value of nutrition and medicine. However, eating GSP could result in allergic reaction to humans, infant, or children are more sensitive to GSP, the clinical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bellyache, diarrhea, dysphoria, exanimation, convulsions, dyspnea, and mydriasis, and sometimes even death can occur.  In the study, we used the method of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatments, which can significantly improve the functional properties and reduce the antigenicity of GSP. After the HHP treatment, GSP can be transformed into proteins with small molecular weights ranging from 4 to 30\u00a0kDa, the antigenicity of GSP can be reduced by more than 95%, and the heat stability and emulsifying properties of GSP can be markedly improved. Thus, this study is very helpful for designing the hypoallergenic and improved functional GSP, which could have a relevant practical application for their use as base ingredients of food.",

Traditionally, the separation methods for the polyprenols are lack of selectivity and their separation efficiency are low. We synthesized two kinds of functional nano-silica containing silver ions materials (AgTCM and AgTCN) which have selectivity for unsaturated compounds to separate Ginkgo biloba leaves polyprenols for the first time. AgTCN displays exceptionally high selectivity for polyprenols and high stability under extended heat and light exposure, while silver is virtually immobile during solvent elution. Importantly, the exceptional stability of AgTCN gives rise to much higher polyprenols recovery than conventional silica gel during the chromatographic elution. In addition, we found that the adsorption of polyprenols onto the AgTCN conforms to pseudo-second-order kinetic model and AgTCN has strong affinity with polyprenols by analyzing Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin-Pyzhev, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. The calculation results of thermodynamic parameters demonstrate that decrease of temperature in favor of increasing the adsorbing capacity of polyprenols onto the AgTCN, and the adsorption process of which is exothermic reaction. Our results pave the way for the novel separation methods of polyprenols from Ginkgo biloba leaves.",

It is found that the flow rate in bare copper nanochannel can be significantly enhanced by a factor of 45 when the nanochannel is coated with monolayer graphene. The enhancement factor for the flow rate reaches about 90 when the nanochannel is modified with 3 or more graphene layers. The dipole relaxation time and the hydrogen bond lifetime of interfacial water molecules show that the graphene coating promotes the mobility of water molecules at the interface. The distribution of the potential of mean force and the free energy barriers also confirm that graphene coating reduces the flow resistance and 3 layers of graphene can fully screen the surface effects.

        "abstract": "Experiments are conducted to investigate fluid flows in converging-diverging microchannels (CDMCs). A new dimensionless number related to channel geometry, Gm, is introduced to combine with the Reynolds number, Re, to characterize the flows. It is found that the new dimensionless number, ReG = Re \u00b7 Gm, is more appropriate than Re for flow characterization in CDMCs. Flows are laminar for ReG u003c 40 regardless of the geometry of CDMCs. For laminar flows, the flow resistance model developed in the literature works well. For transitional and turbulent flows, a general scaling law for the flow resistance is developed, which suggests a polynomial dependence of pressure drop on the flow rate. Numerical simulations have also been performed to confirm experimental results.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the effects of nanogrooves on heterogeneous ice nucleation (HIN) through molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that nanogrooves on a surface significantly alter the ice nucleation rate by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Depending on the width of the grooves, the nucleation rate can be enhanced or impeded compared with that on flat surfaces. For relatively large grooves, ice nucleation enhancement is observed when the effective groove width is a multiple of the ice lattice constant, for which ice crystal nucleus forms in the groove. For narrow grooves, strong confinements lead to the formation of solid-like layered structures, which may or may not enhance ice nucleation, depending on their structural match with ice crystal. The findings in this work provide critical information for surface designs in controlling HIN.",

In this work, the shape memory effect of SMP deployable hinged shell is simulated by using compiled user defined material subroutine (UMAT) subroutine of ABAQUS. Variations of bending moment and strain energy of the hinged shells with different temperatures and structural parameters in the loading process are given. The effects of the parameters and temperature on the nonlinear deformation process are emphasized. The entire thermodynamic cycle of SMP deployable hinged shell includes loading at high temperature, load carrying with cooling, unloading at low temperature and recovering the original shape with heating. The results show that the complicated thermo-mechanical deformation and shape memory effect of SMP deployable hinge are influenced by the structural parameters and temperature.

A honeycomb core using SMP is designed, which has the ability to recover the initial shape after deformation and be used as a smart core for sandwich structures. To prove their advantages in the engineering application, a series of thermodynamic behaviors of the SMP honeycomb core are simulated, including loading at high temperature, cooling, unloading at the low temperature, and recovering original shape on heating.

A specific characterization set-up has been developed to control the applied compression and the perpendicularity of the applied force on the devices. The role of different fabrication parameters has been evaluated experimentally and compared with previously reported theoretical models, including the thickness of the top PMMA layer and the density of the NWs array in the matrix. Finally, the performance of the VING structure has been evaluated experimentally for different resistive loads obtaining a power density of 85 \u03bcW cm\u22123 considering only the active layer of the device.

        "abstract": "To ensure the confidentiality of color images during their storage or transmission on insecure networks, a number of encryption methods based on fractional transforms have been proposed and widely investigated. However, most of their outputs are complex values that are inconvenient for record and transmission. Also, those methods always deal with a whole color component with the same fractional-order and ignore the textural features that are contained in different image parts. In this paper, we first define a reality-preserving multiple-parameter fractional Hartley transform (RPMPFRHT), whose output is real value, and then a novel color image encryption method is proposed that divides the RGB components into different blocks and uses a constructed pixel scrambling operator to mix and hide the original color information. The outputs are transformed to different RPMPFRHT domains and further scrambled by a non-adjacent coupled map lattices system. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate that the proposed encryption algorithm is feasible, secure, sensitive to keys, and robust to potential attacks.",

Then, we propose a new color image encryption algorithm based on the defined RPMPDFrAT. The encryption process consists of two phases: encryption in the spatial domain and RPMPDFrAT domain. In the spatial domain, three color components of the plain image are mapped by dual cylindrical transform, which can nonlinearly hide the original color information. Then, the intermediate output is scrambled by a coupled logistic map to reduce the correlation of adjacent pixels and uniformly distribute the image energy of different color components. Thereafter, the scrambled image is transformed by the proposed RPMPDFrAT, which can ensure that we obtain the real-value output. Finally, a process similar to the spatial domain is performed in the RPMPDFrAT domain to further improve the security of the cryptosystem. Numerical simulations are performed and demonstrate that the proposed image encryption algorithm is effective and sensitive to keys. Moreover, some potential attacks are tested to verify the robustness of the proposed method, and the performance of our method outperforms previously published ones.",

        "abstract": "The explosive growth in high-dimensional visual data requires effective regularization techniques to utilize the underlying low-dimensional structure. We consider low-rank matrix recovery, and many existing approaches are based on the nuclear norm regularization. Recently, truncated nuclear norm (TNNR) has been proposed to achieve a better approximation to the rank function than that of the traditional nuclear norm. TNNR was defined by the nuclear norm by subtracting the sum of the largest \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$r$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n singular values. However, the estimation of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$r$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n is not trivial. In addition, the original algorithm based on TNNR only considers the matrix completion cases and requires double loops, which is not quite computationally efficient. Correspondingly, in this paper, we propose the adaptive bisection method to adaptively estimate \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$r$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, which can efficiently reduce the cost of computation. Moreover, to further accelerate computing, we apply iteratively reweighted nuclear norm to solve the nonconvex TNNR directly, and the convergence can also be guaranteed. Finally, we extend the applications of TNNR from the matrix completion problems to the general low-rank matrix recovery. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of the-art methods.",
