        "abstract": "The process neural networks (PNNs) are networks that adapt to the process of signal input, whose elementary unit is the process neuron (PN), an emerging neuron model. Both essential difference and close correlation exist between the process neuron and the traditional neurons, for example, PN can be approximated by traditional neurons with arbitrary precision. In this paper, the PN model and some PNNs are introduced. Then, two PN approximating theorems are presented and proved in detail. Each theorem gives an approximating model to the PN model, i.e., the time-domain feature expansion model and the orthogonal decomposition feature expansion model. Moreover, a corollary is given for the real-valued output PNN based on the second theorem. Afterwards, a simulation of analog signals is carried out, showing that the PNN can well suppress the white noises contained in signals. Finally, some problems about PNNs are discussed and further research orientations are suggested.",

        "abstract": "Tumor response and normal tissue toxicity of seven-day-per-week continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR) for patients with esophageal carcinoma were evaluated and compared to conventional irradiation (CR).Sixty patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were randomized into two groups: the CAIR group (30 patients) and the CR group (30 patients). Patients in the CAIR group received radiotherapy (RT) with 2 Gy/fraction per day at 7 d/wk with a total dose of 50-70 Gy (average dose 64.2 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 3.6-5.0 wk (average 4.6 wk). RT in the CR group was 2 Gy/fraction per day at 5 d/wk with a total dose of 40-70 Gy (average dose 61.7 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 4.0-7.0 wk (average 6.4 wk).The data showed that the immediate tumor response to RT was better in the CAIR group than in the CR group. Efficiency rates (CR plus PR) were 82.8% (24/29) and 58.6% (17/29), respectively (P = 0.047). In both groups the incidences of esophagitis and tracheitis were insignificant (P = 0.376, 0.959), and no patient received toxicity that could not be tolerated.CAIR shortens overall treatment time and is well tolerated by patients. It may be superior to CR in enhancing the local response of tumor, but its remote effect for esophageal carcinoma awaits further follow-up.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the responses and acute toxicities and life quality of concurrent sequential radiochemotherapy with three-dimensional conformai radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). METHODS: Totally 45 patients with LS-SCLC were randomized into concurrent group (group A, 23 patients) and sequential group (group B, 22 patients). All patients in these two groups received 3D-CRT and IMRT (1. 8-2. 0 Gy/f, 5 times every week, totally, 50. 4-62. 0 Gy in 28-31 F) and 4-6 cycles of sequential chemotherapy by EP regimen. The radiotherapy targets were the primary tumor and the involved lymph nodes. 3D-CRT and IMRT were started in the first cycle of chemotherapy in group A. Patients in group B were treated with radiation after 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rate of group A and group B was 95% and 86% for the primary tumor. The 12-and 18-month overall survival rate were 84%, 69% and 76%, 34%. Grade I or II acute radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis was observed in 78% and 86% of patients in group A compared with 73% and 81% in group B. Grade III-IV acute hematopoietic toxicity was observed in 8% of patients in group A and 9% in group B. Life quality was no statistically significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSION: 3D-CRT and IMRT with current sequential chemotherapy is effective for LS-SCLC with the side effects being tolerable and quality of life being not falling.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study is to explore the bystander effects in A549 cells that have been exposed to 6MV X-ray. Control group, irradiated group, irradiated conditioned medium (ICM)-received group, and fresh medium group were designed in this study. A549 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were irradiated with 6MV X-ray at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2. In ICM-received group, post-irradiation A549 cells were cultured for 3 h and were transferred into non-irradiated A549 cells for further cultivation. Clone forming test was applied to detect the survival fraction of cells. Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining assay was used to detect the apoptosis of A549 cells 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after 2-Gy 6MV X-ray irradiation, and the curves of apoptosis were drawn. The changes in the cell cycles 4, 48, 72, and 96 h after 2-Gy 6MV X-ray irradiation were detected using PI staining flow cytometry. With the increase of irradiation dose, the survival fraction of A549 cells after the application of 0.5 Gy irradiation was decreasing continuously. In comparison to the control group, the apoptosis rate of the ICM-received group was increased in a time-dependent pattern, with the highest apoptosis rate observed at 72 h (p < 0.05). Cell count in G2/M stages was obviously increased compared with that of the control group (p < 0.05), with the highest count observed at 72 h, after which G2/M stage arrest was diminished. ICM can cause apparent A549 cell damage, indicating that 6MV X-ray irradiation can induce bystander effect on A549 cells, which reaches a peak at 72 h.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between intracellular free Ca~ 2+ concentration (Ca~ 2+_i) and calcium-activated chloride (Cl_ca ) channels of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) in rats under acute and chronic hypoxic conditions, acute hypoxia-induced contraction was observed in rat pulmonary artery by using routine blood vascular perfusion in vitro. The fluorescence Ca~ 2+ indicator Fura-2/AM was used to observe Ca~ 2+ _i of rat PASMCs under normal and chronic hypoxic condition. The effect of Cl_ ca channels on PASMCs proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. The Cl_ ca channel blockers niflumic acid (NFA) and indaryloxyacetic acid (IAA-94) exerted inhibitory effects on acute hypoxia-evoked contractions in the pulmonary artery. Under chronic hypoxic condition, Ca~ 2+ _i was increased. Under normoxic condition, Ca~ 2+ _i was (123.63\u00b118.98) nmol/L, and in hypoxic condition, Ca~ 2+ _i was (281.75\u00b116.48) nmol/L (P<0.01). Under normoxic condition, Ca~ 2+ _i showed no significant change and no effect on Cl_ ca channels was observed (P>0.05). Chronic hypoxia increased Ca~ 2+ _i which opened Cl_ ca channels. The NFA and IAA-94 blocked the channels and decreased Ca~ 2+ _i from (281.75\u00b116.48) nmol/L to (117.66\u00b115.36) nmol/L (P<0.01). MTT assay showed that under chronic hypoxic condition NFA and IAA-94 decreased the value of absorbency (A value) from 0.459\u00b10.058 to 0.224\u00b10.025 (P<0.01). Hypoxia increased Ca~ 2+ _i which opened Cl_ ca channels and had a positive-feedback in Ca~ 2+ _i. This may play an important role in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Under chronic hypoxic condition, Cl_ca channel may play a part in the regulation of proliferation of PASMCs.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and calcium-activated chloride (Clca) channels of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) in rats under acute and chronic hypoxic conditions, acute hypoxia-induced contraction was observed in rat pulmonary artery by using routine blood vascular perfusion in vitro. The fluorescence Ca2+ indicator Fura-2/AM was used to observe [Ca2+]i of rat PASMCs under normal and chronic hypoxic condition. The effect of Clca channels on PASMCs proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. The Clca channel blockers niflumic acid (NFA) and indanyloxyacetic acid (IAA-94) exerted inhibitory effects on acute hypoxia-evoked contractions in the pulmonary artery. Under chronic hypoxic condition, [Ca2+]i was increased. Under normoxic condition, [Ca2+]i was (123.63 +/- 18.98) nmol/L, and in hypoxic condition, [Ca2+]i was (281.75 +/- 16.48) nmol/L (P<0.01). Under normoxic condition, [Ca2+]i showed no significant change and no effect on Clca channels was observed (P> 0.05). Chronic hypoxia increased [Ca2+]i which opened Clca channels. The NFA and IAA-94 blocked the channels and decreased [Ca2+]i from (281.75 +/- 16.48) nmol/L to (117.66 +/- 15.36) nmol/L (P<0.01). MTT assay showed that under chronic hypoxic condition NFA and IAA-94 decreased the value of absorbency (A value) from 0.459 +/- 0.058 to 0.224 +/- 0.025 (P<0.01). Hypoxia increased [Ca2+]i which opened Clca channels and had a positive-feedback in [Ca2+]i. This may play an important role in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Under chronic hypoxic condition, Clca channel may play a part in the regulation of proliferation of PASMCs.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate therapeutic effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on bronchial asthma. Methods Fourteen SD rats were randomly divided into two groups, 7 rats were sensitized as asthmatic model and the others as healthy controls. Results The quantity of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA in blank group of asthmatic models(0.58\u00b10.086, 1.03\u00b10.12 and 0.48\u00b10.08 respectively), significantly increased (P<0.05). The quantity of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA decreased significantly when the T lymphocytes of asthmatic model rats were cultured with BN-52021(0.49\u00b10.05, 0.55\u00b10.09 and 0.27\u00b10.05 respectively), P<0.05. The ratio of IL-2/IL-4 mRNA in normal rats was 1.27\u00b10.20, which was significantly higher than that in asthmatic model rats( 0.60 \u00b10.18, P<0.01). BN-52021 significantly increased the ratio when the T lymphocytes of asthmatic model rats CM(43were cultured with it(P<0.01). BN-52021 significantly counteracted the level of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 mRNACM) that increased by PMA(P<0.05), but the decreasing effect was less than the Ro31-8220, a specific inhibitor of PKC\u03b1(P<0.05). BN-52021 failed to further counteract the level of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA increased by PMA which had significantly decreased by the Ro31-8220. The expression ratio of PKC\u03b1 in membrane and cytoplasm of T lymphocytes of asthmatic model rats was significantly higher than that in normal rats(P<0.01), and BN-52021 significantly decreased the ratio when the T lymphocytes were cultured with it(P<0.05). Furthermore, it also significantly counteracted the expression ratio of PKC\u03b1 in membrane and cytoplasm which increased by PMA(P<0.05). The expression ratio of PKC\u03b1 in membrane and cytoplasm was positively correlated with the level of IL-4 mRNA in T lymphocytes cultured in vitro in asthmatic model rats group(n=42, r=0.845, P<0.01). Conclusion Ginkgo biloba extract depress the expression of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA of asthmatic model rat T lymphocytes in vitro. However, the inhibition effects were distinct in degree, so the balance of IL-2/IL-4 was changed. Ginkgo biloba extract inhibits the expression ratio of PKC\u03b1 in membrane and cytoplasm. It is possible that Ginkgo biloba extract influences the production of interleukin and the balance of T_H1/T_H2 in the asthmatic model rats through its influence on the PKC signal pathway.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of the Ginkgo Biloba Extract (GBE) on the asthma and examine its possible mechanisms, 75 asthma patients were divided into 4 groups and the patients were respectively treated with fluticasone propionate for 2 weeks or 4 weeks, or treated with fluticasone propionate plus GBE for 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as healthy controls. Sputum inhalation with inhaling hypertonic saline (4%-5%) was performed. Lung ventilatory function and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were measured. The numbers of different cells in induced sputum were calculated. The expression of PKC\u03b1 in the cells was immunocytochemically detected and the percentages of positive cells in different cells were counted. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) in sputum supernatants was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The percentage of eosinophils, lymphocytes, PKC\u03b1 positive inflammatory cells and the concentration of IL-5 in asthmatic patients were higher than those in the controls (P<0.05), and the eosinophils, lymphocytes, positive expression of PKC\u03b1 and the level of IL-5 were significantly decreased in asthmatic patients after they were treated with fluticasone propionate or fluticasone propionate plus GBE. However, they were still significantly higher than those of the controls. Compared to the group treated with glucocorticosteroid for 2 weeks, no significant decrease was found in the percentage of eosinophils, lymphocytes, PKC\u03b1 positive inflammatory cells and the IL-5 in the supernatant of induced sputum. Compared with the group treated with glucocorticosteroid for 2 or 4 weeks, significant decrease in the same parameters was observed in the group treated with fluticasone propionate and GBE for 4 weeks. The IL-5 level in the supernatant of induced sputum was positively correlated with the percentage of PKC\u03b1-positive inflammatory cells and the percentage of eosinophils in the induced sputum in asthma patient groups respectively (n=150, r= 0.83, P<0.01; n=150, r=0.76, P<0.01). The FEV1 was negatively correlated with the percentage of PKC\u03b1-positive inflammatory cells and the IL-5 levels in supernatant of induced sputum in asthma patients respectively (n=150, r=-0.77, P<0.01; n=150, r= -0.64, P<0.01). It is concluded that GBE could significantly decrease the infiltration of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and lymphocytes in the asthmatic airway and relieve the airway inflammation. GBE may decrease the activation of the PKC\u03b1 in the inflammatory cells and thereby decrease the IL-5 level in induced sputum. GBE may be used as a complement to the glucocorticosteroid therapy for asthma. \u00a9 2007 Huazhong University of Science and Technology.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the role of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the regulation of calcium-activated chloride (ClCa) channels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) of rats under normoxic, acute and chronic hypoxic conditions. METHODS: Acute hypoxia-induced contraction was observed in rat pulmonary artery by using routine blood vascular perfusion in vitro. The fluorescence Ca2+ indicator Fura-2/AM was used to observe [Ca2+]i of rat PASMCs in normal and chronic hypoxic condition. The influences of ClCa channels on PASMCs proliferation were assessed by MTT assay. RESULTS: (1) The ClCa channel blockers niflumic acid (NFA) and indaryloxyacetic acid (IAA-94) produced inhibitory effects on acute hypoxia-evoked contractions in pulmonary artery. (2) Under chronic hypoxic condition, [Ca2+]i was increased. In normoxic condition, [Ca2+]i was (123.63\u00b118.98) nmol/L, and in hypoxic condition, [Ca2+]i was (281.75\u00b116.48)nmol/L (P<0.01). (3) In normoxic condition, [Ca2+]i had no significant change and no effect on ClCa channels was observed (P>0.05). (4) Chronic hypoxic increased [Ca2+]i which opened ClCa channels. The NFA and IAA-94 blocked them and decreased [Ca2+]i from (281.75\u00b116.48)nmol/L to (117.66\u00b115.36)nmol/L (P<0.01). (5) MTT assay showed that in chronic hypoxic condition NFA and IAA-94 decreased the value of absorbing light degree (A value) from 0.459\u00b10.058 to 0.224\u00b10.025 (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Hypoxia increased [Ca2+]i which opened ClCa channels and had a positive-feedback to [Ca2+]i. This may play an important role in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. In chronic hypoxic condition, ClCa channel may play a role in the regulation of PASMCs proliferation.",

        "abstract": "Identifying patients with high risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy is of immense value in clinical practice. Assessment of prognostic significance of specific clinicopathological features plays an important role in surgical management after prostatectomy. The purpose of our meta-analysis was to investigate the association between the six pathological characteristics and the prognosis of prostate cancer. We carried out a systematic document retrieval in electronic databases to sort out appropriate studies. Outcomes of interest were gathered from studies comparing biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCFS) in patients with the six pathological traits. Studies results were pooled, and hazard ratios (HRs) combined with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for survival were used to estimate the effect size. 29 studies (21,683 patients) were enrolled in our meta-analysis. All the six predictors were statistically significant for BCFS with regard to seminal vesicle invasion (HR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.79-2.18,  < 0.00001), positive surgical margin (HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.56-2.06,  < 0.00001), extracapsular extension (HR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.65-2.50,  < 0.0001), lymphovascular invasion (HR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.54-2.22,  < 0.00001), lymph node involvement (HR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.37-2.60,  = 0.0001) and perineural invasion (HR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.33-1.91,  < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis showed that all the six predictors had significantly relationship with poor BCFS. The pooled results demonstrated that the six clinical findings indicated a worse prognosis in patients with prostate cancer. In conclusion, our results show several clinicopathological characteristics can predict the risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Prospective studies are needed to further confirm the predictive value of these features for the prognosis of prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.",

        "abstract": "Interaction of pioglitazone(PGZ) and macrophages(Mps) in renal crystal formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated possible mechanisms involved with Mps of PGZ in suppressing renal crystal formation. Crystal formation in mice kidney was detected by using polarized light optical microscopy and Pizzolato staining. Gene expression was detected by western blot, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence. Macrophage phenotypes were identified by flow cytometric analysis. Cell apoptosis was detected with TUNEL assay and tubular injury was detected with PAS staining. Interaction of PPAR\u03b3 and promoter was determined by ChIP assay. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to authenticate target genes of microRNA-23(miR-23). Recombinant adenovirus was used to elucidate the role of miR-23 in vivo. Renal crystal formation, inflammation, tubular injury and cell apoptosis were significantly marked in glyoxylic acid(GA)-treated groups and significantly decreased in PGZ-treated groups. PGZ significantly reduced Mps infiltration and M1Mps polarization in kidney. In vitro, PGZ shifted the crystal-stimulated M1-predominant Mps to M2-predominant Mps which were anti-inflammatory. PPAR\u03b3 could directly bind to 1 PPAR\u03b3 regulatory element in the promoter of the pre-miR-23 to promote expression of miR-23 in Mps. We identified two downstream target genes of miR-23, Irf1 and Pknox1. Moreover, miR-23 could decrease crystal deposition, M1Mps polarization and injury in the kidney. This study had proven that PGZ decreased renal calcium oxalate crystal formation and renal inflammatory injury by suppressing M1Mps polarization through a PPAR\u03b3-miR-23-Irf1/Pknox1 axis. PGZ is liable to be a potential therapeutical medicine for treating urolithiasis.",

        "abstract": "Background. As a newly discovered lncRNA, bladder cancer-associated transcript 1 (BLACAT1) has been reported to correlate with poor clinical outcomes in several different cancers. This study aimed to evaluate its generalized predictive value for cancer prognosis. Materials and Methods. We thoroughly searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for eligible studies published until November 11, 2018, in which the relationship between BLACAT1 expression and cancer prognosis was explored. The analyses were performed using Review Manager Version 5.3 and Stata SE 12.0. The primary endpoints included overall survival (OS), pathological characteristics (TNM stage and tumor grade), lymph node metastasis (LNM), and distant metastasis. Results. Ten studies containing 861 patients with 7 different cancerous diseases were eventually included. The results demonstrated that patients with high lncRNA BLACAT1 expression had a significantly shorter OS (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.44-2.30, p u003c 0.00001) than patients with low lncRNA BLACAT1 expression. Moreover, elevated BLACAT1 expression was significantly associated with advanced TNM stage (OR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.15-4.56, p = 0.005), high tumor grade (OR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.11-2.53, p = 0.01), and lymph node metastasis (OR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.80-3.57, p u003c 0.00001). Meanwhile, the expression of BLACAT1 had no significant association with age (p = 0.92), gender (p = 0.55), and smoking (p = 0.62). Conclusion. High expression of lncRNA BLACAT1 may predict a poor prognosis in OS, TNM stage, tumor grade, and LNM. Its predictive roles were not significantly affected by age, gender, or smoking. Therefore, lncRNA BLACAT1 may serve as a promising predictor in cancer prognosis.",

        "abstract": "In recent years,crop insurance in China grows rapidly,but it still lacks actuarial support.The yield simulation model is one of the most widely employed models used in crop insurance premium rating,and is tailored for multi-peril yield insurance lines.It will promote crop insurance rating research and practice in China to comprehensively introduce the model.This article summarized the major issues that induce uncertainty and problems in accuracy in the yield simulation model,and provided discussions on its future development on the basis of a comprehensive review.It was found that detrending and distribution fitting are the two major uncertain factors.The problem that has not been well solved by the model is the aggregation of spatially-correlated risks.It was suggested that detrending analysis should pay enough attention to information beyond the yield data and emphasize on trend verification.Empirical models used for distribution fitting should be crop and region specific.The most urgent development for the yield simulation model is incorporating spatial elements and developing integrated spatial-temporal yield simulation model to cope with spatial correlation of individual risks.All of these require further interdisciplinary efforts from geography,agriculture,disaster and risk,and actuary,etc.,to improve the capability of classic yield simulation model.",

        "abstract": "China is exposed to a wide range of natural hazards, including earthquake, flood, drought, and so on. The occurrence of hazards is not a phenomenon of recent time; however, understanding vulnerability, especially social vulnerability, is a relatively recent trend. In order to prevent disasters from happening, more attention should be paid on this changeful literature. This paper focuses on social vulnerability assessment, especially on constructing a social vulnerability index Isov. Based on Hoovering approach, a methodology with factor analysis and multiple regression analysis is proposed. By this novel methodology, a set of socioeconomic variables are reduced to a few independent factors, and a quantitative model of social vulnerability has been constructed. This model can assist decision - makers in better finding out the real driving factors and dynamic changes of Isov. There is a trial application to Changsha. All data arc from 1980 -2003. With this methodology, a dynamic process of Isov in Changsha region is predicted, and Isov of five districts and four counties in Changsha are compared.",

        "abstract": "Based on a general introduction to the content of the 6th open meeting of IHDP, and an overview of the major projects and science plans of ESSP and IHDP, this paper discussed the future science issues and development priorities for human-environment research in Geography. Besides regional heterogeneity and holistic view, which have already been highly emphasized in Geography, the human-environment system also has vulnerability, risk, resilience and adaptability, which are newly discovered inherent features. These four features can modify, change or transform each other in certain spatial and temporal context. Because of these features, Geography, which takes the mechanism and process of the human-environment system as its congenital task, must redesign its research strategy to contribute to the global human-environment research community. The necessary strategic transformations for geographic research include: from element and pattern oriented to process oriented integrated research; from integrated research which combines physical geography and human geography to systematic research on resources and environment issues; from environment reconstruction to integrated disaster risk management research; from dynamics of pattern and process to systematic simulation of resources guarantee and regional security; from regional human-environment interaction mechanism research to global human-environment interaction mechanism research. This is a big challenge for Geography, and also a precious opportunity we could not bear to lose. We should learn from the strategies in the science plans for global environmental change of IHDP and IGBP, strengthen the understanding of dynamic and non-dynamic behaviors of the human-environment system, then solve the complex globalization, urbanization, resources, environment, ecology, disaster, risk and sustainable development problems we are facing through systematic and integrated research, which is a big advantage of Geography, and gradually approach a resource conserving and environment friendly society. Only in this way, could geographers contribute to the construction of a well off and harmonious society in China, the decision making of global sustainable development, and the bi-health of human and Earth.",

However, risk exposure of costal socioeconomic system to ocean hazards has been increasing as maritime affairs and economic density of costal zone keeps rising. The costal zone is seriously polluted and the possibility of occurrence of marine biological disaster is increasing, all of these factors will make rise of the regional disaster risk in China sea area and costal zone.

        "abstract": "Land use efficiency and benefit are the most important indexes measuring rationality of land resources utilization.It is of great significance to the study on the impact of land policy change on land use efficiency and benefit for land policy assessment and revision.In this paper,the authors try to reveal the impacts of urban land policy reform on land use efficiency and economic benefit using quantitative approach,taking Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ),the pioneer of urban land policy reform in China as a case. First of all,land policy reform is reviewed from two aspects,which are changes in land property rights and changes in the system of land rent and land price.On one hand,the impacts of policy changes on land transaction were decomposedinto four implement variables,including prescription of land property rights,transferability of land property rights,ways of transaction in primary land market,and ways of transaction in secondary and tertiary land markets based on reviewing land policy reform.A multiplicative model is employed here to integrate their changes and calculate the value of implement variable of land policy.On the other hand,land use efficiency and economic benefit are calculated.The result indicates that their changes are approximately synchronous with the changes in land policy.Land policy,land use efficiency and economic benefit finally show significant correlations with coefficients of 0.743 and 0.879,respectively.This result also proves that land policy reform in China did bring significantly positive effects in socioeconomic development.",

        "abstract": "Detrending is a widely used technique for obtaining stationary time series data in residual analysis and risk assessment. The technique is frequently applied in crop yield risk assessment and insurance ratings. Although several trend models have been proposed in the literature, whether these models achieve consistent detrending results and successfully extract the true yield trends is rarely discussed. In the present article, crop insurance pricing is evaluated by different trend models using real and historical yield data, and hypothetical yield data generated by Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to real historical data, the linear, loglinear, autoregressive integrated moving average trend models produce different risk assessment results. The differences among the model outputs are statistically significant. The largest deviation in the county crop assessment reaches 6\u20138\u00a0%, substantially larger than the present countrywide gross premium rate of 5\u20137\u00a0%. In performance tests on simulated yield trends, popular detrending methods based on smoothing techniques proved overall superior to linear, loglinear, and integrated autoregression models. The best performances were yielded by the moving average and robust locally weighted regression models.",

Mass losses occurred mostly because the intensity of the quake and the induced tsunami exceeded local coping capacity. Particularly, the nuclear power plant crisis triggered by the tsunami significantly increased the short- and long-term impacts of the disaster. While the coping capacity Japanese society built after the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji great earthquake tremendously mitigated the damages, there is room for improvement despite Japan\u2019s great efforts in this disaster. Investigating the tsunami preparedness of the coastal nuclear power plants is an issue of paramount importance. In response to future large-scale disasters, there is an urgent need for a highly collaborative framework based on which all available resources could be mobilized; a mutual assistance and rescue system against catastrophes among regions and countries on the basis of international humanitarian aid; and further in-depth research on the multi-hazard and disaster-chain phenomenon in large-scale disasters and corresponding governance approaches.",

        "abstract": "China has been frequently and heavily affected by drought disasters. During 2009\u20132010, three large-scale severe droughts struck China, caused considerable social, economic, and ecological losses. These droughts showed significant regional differences. This study employs a two-stage transition framework comprising \u201centry\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d transitions to discuss disaster risk management of drought in China, by taking the three droughts as comparative case studies. Chinese society\u2019s response in the exit transition is examined and the underlying factors that enable the entry trigger are diagnosed. The policy responses that lead to the exit transition from these drought disasters were appropriate, but there is substantial room for improvement in management strategy regarding both entry and exit transitions. This article suggests that government policies should emphasize entry-prevention measures that reduce adverse impacts early in a drought episode rather than focus solely on improving performance in achieving a rapid exit transition from drought.",

It has not been adequately addressed that how those impacts transmit from one (sub-) system/network to another and how the socioeconomic systems respond. This paper examines the impact of the global economic crisis and the Tohoku earthquake on Sino\u2013Japan trade based on trade data released by the Japanese Ministry of Finance. Our time series analysis model shows that in the short term, the economic crisis has an impact of 66\u00a0% larger than that of the earthquake. The impact of economic crisis is more acute and deep due to the collapse of consumers\u2019 and investors\u2019 confidence, but for the earthquake, it is more gradual as the impact spreads via production chain and supply chain across industries and regions. The pattern implies critical difference in disaster risk reduction strategies for the two types of catastrophes.",

        "abstract": "Diagnosing all components of risk is essential in earthquake loss attribution science, but quantitative estimates on how sensitive the earthquake-induced direct economic losses (DELs) are to changes in hazard, exposure and vulnerability is rarely known. Here the relationship between earthquake DELs and earthquake magnitude (Ms), asset value exposure (K), proportion of non-steel-concrete residential buildings (H) and physical environment instability (E) is quantified using the concept of economic elasticity. Earthquake disaster event-based DEL records over the period from 1990 to 2016 for the mainland of China are fitted to a regression model. Elasticity values for Ms, K, H and E are 7.63, 0.75, 4.92 and 0.91, respectively, indicating that on average, DEL changes are more sensitive to changes in Ms and H-a 13% increase in Ms or a 20% increase in H would double earthquake DELs, while it may take a 133% increase in K or a 110% increase in E to cause the same economic losses. In turn, this suggests that human factors-decreasing H and K-could be efficient ways to reduce earthquake risk, while these two factors will become increasingly relevant for risk assessment in the future with continued economic growth. The elasticity estimate results could be used for studying future change in earthquake risks and for supporting disaster risk reduction strategies.",

        "abstract": "How to allocate and use resources play a crucial role in disaster reduction and risk governance (DRRG). The challenge comes largely from two aspects: the resources available for allocation are usually limited in quantity; and the multiple stakeholders involved in DRRG often have conflicting interests in the allocation of these limited resources. Therefore resource allocation in DRRG can be formulated as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP). The Pareto front is a key concept in resolving a MOOP, and it is associated with the complete set of optimal solutions. However, most existing methods for solving a MOOPs only calculate a part or an approximation of the Pareto front, and thus can hardly provide the most effective or accurate support to decision-makers in DRRG. This article introduces a new method whose goal is to find the complete Pareto front that resolves the resource allocation optimization problem in DRRG. The theoretical conditions needed to guarantee finding a complete Pareto front are given and a practicable, ripple-spreading algorithm is developed to calculate the complete Pareto front. A resource allocation problem of risk governance in agriculture is then used as a case study to test the applicability and reliability of the proposed method. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency when compared with traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has played an important role in disaster risk reduction (DRR) investment decisions, and now increasing attention is being paid to its application in developing countries. This article discusses government investment choices in DRR against typhoon disasters in Shenzhen, China. While the existing literature mainly focuses on disaster mitigation measures such as structural retrofitting, this study proposes a holistic framework of DRR investments in which structural (windproof retrofitting) and financial (insurance premium subsidies and post-disaster relief) are all taken into account. In particular, intermeasure spillover effects are measured and used in CBA. The results show that insurance premium subsidies yield the highest benefit-cost ratio and should be prioritized in investment. Windproof retrofitting comes in second place in terms of the benefit-cost ratio and can be considered when there is a sufficient budget. These results further confirm the need of a holistic review of government DRR investments to derive policy recommendations, while challenges remain in relation to the probabilistic modeling capacity to support CBA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Understanding risk using a quantitative risk assessment offers critical information for risk-informed reduction actions, investing in building resilience, and planning for adaptation. This study develops an event-based probabilistic risk assessment model for livestock snow disasters in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) region and derives risk assessment results based on historical climate conditions (1980\u20132015) and present-day prevention capacity. In the model a hazard module was developed to identify/simulate individual snow disaster events based on boosted regression trees. Together with a fitted quantitative vulnerability function, and exposure derived from vegetation type and grassland carrying capacity, risk metrics based on livestock mortality and mortality rate were estimated. In our results, high risk regions include the Nyainqentanglha Range, Tanggula Range, Bayankhar Mountains and the region between the Kailas Range and neighboring Himalayas. In these regions, annual livestock mortality rates were estimated as u003e\u20092\u2009% and mortality was estimated as u003e\u20092 sheep unit/km 2  at a return period of 1/20\u2009a. Prefectures identified with extremely high risk included Yushu in Qinghai Province and Naqu, Shigatse, Linzhi, and Nagri in the Tibet Autonomous Region. In these prefectures, a snow disaster event with return period of 1/20\u2009a or higher can easily claim a total loss of more than 200\u2009000 sheep units. Our results provide a quantitative reference for preparedness and insurance solutions in reducing mortality risk. The methodology developed here can be further adapted to future climate change risk analyses and provide important information for planning climate change adaption in the QTP region.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - Understanding farmers\u2019 preferences for crop insurance attributes is crucial in designing better insurance products and guiding government policies but such research is lacking, particularly in developing countries. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a survey featuring a discrete choice experiment and policy simulation. Findings - Overall, crop insurance has positive values to farmers, although preference is heterogeneous based on socioeconomic characteristics and risk position. Policy simulation confirms the roles of liability in strengthening insurance participants\u2019 welfare and premium subsidy in encouraging participation. Introducing one more product into the market can accommodate farmers\u2019 diverse needs and lead to increases in both aggregated social welfare and participation while maintaining the current level of government expense in subsidy \u2013 a potential Pareto improvement. Research limitations/implications - Methodology employed is not the most novel in the choice experiment literature as many of the advances in choice experiment design could not be applied due to the actual condition in rural China and Chinese farmers\u2019 capability in understanding the experiment. Practical implications - The results indicate that the current single-product market structure using \u201clow liability with high premium subsidies\u201d cannot accommodate the diverse needs among farmers. Providing more varieties of liability-subsidy combinations, e.g. a high liability with low premium subsidy insurance product, can substantially improve participants\u2019 welfare with little impact to the probability of participation. Originality/value - The authors believe that this is one of the very few studies that that analyze farmers\u2019 preferences and willingness to pay for the attributes of crop insurance products. It also shows how crop insurance product design can build upon farmers\u2019 choices to achieve a potential Pareto improvement in aggregated social welfare in the context of a fast-developing crop insurance market.",

        "title": "Factors contribution to oxygen concentration in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau",
        "abstract": "Oxygen (O 2 ) is essential for physiological activity in humans. On the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, with an average altitude of more than  4\u2005km,  hypoxia can seriously damage local residents health, especially the respiratory system. When an organism cannot fully compensate for insufficient physiological function caused by hypoxia, acute and chronic mountain sickness (AMS and CMS) will occur. Previous studies have suggested that the relative oxygen concentration (ROC) in the near-ground air shows no obvious changes at different altitudes. However, during field work in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we found that, in addition to altitude, surface vegetation coverage and weather conditions may also have an impact on ROC. The results of data analysis showed that altitude and 500 hPa air temperature (500 hPa-T) were negatively correlated with ROC, while vegetation coverage was directly proportional to ROC. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), the results indicated that altitude, vegetation coverage and 500 hPa-T accounted for 65.5% of the total variance in ROC, of which the variance interpretation rate of vegetation coverage was highest (33.1%), followed by 500 hPa-T (28.5%) and altitude (3.9%). Absolute oxygen concentration (AOC) was calculated using the Ideal-Gas Equation. Using this equation, we found that altitude, vegetation coverage and 500 hPa-T accounted for 78.9% of the total variance in AOC, of which the variance interpretation rate of altitude was highest (45.9%), followed by vegetation coverage (18.5%) and 500 hPa-T (14.5%). AOC was negatively correlated with the incidence of CMS, and elevated AOC significantly reduced the incidence of CMS. The science community should pay more attention to this topic as a further decrease in ROC could significantly increase instability and risk in populations at high altitudes. These findings could enhance our understanding of the relationships between oxygen concentration, altitude, vegetation, weather conditions and their interactions. In addition, this research may not only play an important guiding role in human and animal health in high altitude areas, but also significantly deepen our understanding of the risks in high altitude environments under global warming both theoretically and practically. Multi-source data, including  in - situ  measurement data, remote sensing data, and model reanalysis data, will facilitate further implementations in this direction. Future work can be carried out using more fixed-point observations and by expanding the spatio-temporal extent of relevant data in high altitudes.",

        "abstract": "Livestock snow disaster occurs widely in Central-to-Eastern Asian temperate and alpine grasslands. The effects of snow disaster on livestock involve a complex interaction between precipitation, vegetation, livestock, and herder communities. Quantifying the relationship among livestock mortality, snow hazard intensity, and seasonal environmental stressors is of great importance for snow disaster early warning, risk assessments, and adaptation strategies. Using a wide-spatial extent, long-time series, and event-based livestock snow disaster dataset, this study quantified those relationships and established a quantitative model of livestock mortality for prediction purpose for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. Estimations using generalized additive models (GAMs) were shown to accurately predict livestock mortality and mortality rate due to snow disaster, with adjusted-R up to 0.794 and 0.666, respectively. These results showed that a longer snow disaster duration, lower temperatures during the disaster, and a drier summer with less vegetation all contribute significantly and non-linearly to higher mortality (rate), after controlling for elevation and socioeconomic conditions. These results can be readily applied to risk assessment and risk-based adaptation actions.",

This paper has designed an index-based livestock insurance for managing snow disaster risk for the pastoral regions of Eastern Inner Mongolia, China. Based on detailed information from field surveys, the designed insurance plan targets extra feeding costs induced by snow cover rather than mortality. It employs percentage height of grass covered by snow as the trigger for insurance payments and calculates the aggregate number of days triggered between November 1st and April 30th as the index for calculating insurance payments. A comparison with existing commercial mortality insurance (CMI) based on certainty-equivalent analysis indicates that the designed snow-index insurance (SII) is superior in terms of potential users\u2019 welfare, as it is aimed correctly at the major source of income risk. Even when the loading for administrative costs is included in the premium, the SII still brings welfare improvements for most regions of the study area.",

The relative importance of those factors in explaining the burn probability (BP), which is critical in terms of fire risk management, has been insufficiently addressed. Focusing on a subtropical coniferous forest with strong human disturbance in East China, our main objective was to evaluate and compare the relative importance of fuel composition, topography, and human activity for fire occurrence, size and BP. Local BP distribution was derived with stochastic fire simulation approach using detailed historical fire data (1990-2010) and forest-resource survey results, based on which our factor contribution analysis was carried out. Our results indicated that fuel composition had the greatest relative importance in explaining fire occurrence and size, but human activity explained most of the variance in BP. This implies that the influence of human activity is amplified through the process of overlapping repeated ignition and spreading events. This result emphasizes the status of strong human disturbance in local fire processes. It further confirms the need for a holistic perspective on factor contribution to fire likelihood, rather than focusing on individual fire regime attributes, for the purpose of fire risk management.",

        "abstract": "\nPremium ratemaking is an important issue to guarantee insurance balance of payments. Most ratemaking methods require large samples of long-term loss data or farm-level yield data, which are often unavailable in developing countries. This study develops a crop insurance ratemaking method with survey data. The method involves a questionnaire survey on characteristic yield information (average yield, high yield, and low yield) of farming households\u2019 cropland. After compensating for random error, the probability distributions of farm-level yields are simulated with characteristic yields based on the linear additive model. The premium rate is calculated based on Monte Carlo yield simulation results. This method was applied to Dingxing County, North China to arrive at the insurance loss cost ratio and calculate the necessary premium rate. The method proposed in this study could serve as a feasible technique for crop insurance ratemaking in regions that lack sufficient long-term yield data, especially in developing countries with smallholder agriculture.",

Ultimately, continuing efforts in this vein will accelerate and strengthen relative structure elucidation of complex molecules, such as natural products. Molecular mechanics conformational search, quantum mechanical NMR chemical shift predictions, and DP4 analyses led to confirmation of the revised structures of mandelalides A-D and coibamide A. All chiral centers in the northern hemisphere of mandelalides A-D are inverted with respect to the originally proposed structures, in agreement with recent total syntheses of mandelalide A by Ye, F\u00fcrstner & Carter. In the case of coibamide A, it was found that Fang & Su's revision, in which both the macrocycle [MeAla11] and the side chain [HIV2] residues are inverted from l to d, was consistent with the authentic natural product and computations. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",

The planar structure was established based on the interpretation of MS and NMR data. The absolute configuration of the subunits was determined by the advanced Marfey's method and the chiral LC-MS analysis. Compound 1 exhibited the activity of maintaining colony formation of murine embryonic stem (mES) cells without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Down regulation of the gene expression of Kr\u00fcppel-like transcription factor 4 (Klf4) indicated that 1 itself was not able to maintain the undifferentiated state of the mES cells. However, the expression levels of the marker genes (Nestin, T, Sox17) for three germ layers were upregulated in embryoid bodies (EBs) after treatment of 1 together with LIF, suggesting that 1 plays a supportive role for LIF in maintaining the multipotency of mES cells. \u00a9 2018",

A novel WD40 domain-containing protein, L2DTL/CDT2 and PCNA were identified as proteins associated with CUL4/DDB1 complexes. Inactivation of CUL4A, L2DTL, PCNA, DDB1 or ROC1 induced p53 stabilization and growth arrest. L2DTL, PCNA and DDB1/CUL4A complexes were found to physically interact with p53 tumor suppressor and its regulator MDM2/HDM2. The isolated CUL4A complexes display potent and robust polyubiquitination activity towards p53 and this activity is dependent on L2DTL, PCNA, DDB1, ROC1 and MDM2/HDM2. We also found that the interaction between p53 and CUL4 complex is regulated by DNA damage. Our data further showed that MDM2/HDM2 is rapidly proteolyzed in response to UV irradiation and this process is regulated by CUL4/DDB1 and PCNA. Our studies demonstrate that PCNA, L2DTL and the DDB1-CUL4A complex play critical and differential roles in regulating the protein stability of p53 and MDM2/HDM2 in unstressed and stressed cells.",

        "abstract": "p27Kip1 (p27) binds and inhibits the cyclin E- or cyclin A-associated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)2 and other CDKs, and negatively regulates G1-G2 cell cycle progression. To develop specific CDK inhibitors, we have modeled the interaction between p27 and cyclin A-CDK2, and designed a novel compound that mimics p27 binding to cyclin A-CDK2. The chemically synthesized inhibitor exhibited high potency and selective inhibition towards cyclin E/cyclin A-CDK2 kinase in vitro but not other kinases. To facilitate permeability of the inhibitor, a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) was conjugated to the inhibitor to examine its effect in several cancer cell lines. The CPP-conjugated inhibitor significantly inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells. The treatment of the inhibitor resulted in the increased accumulation of p27 and p21Cip1/Waf1 (p21) and hypo-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). The degradation of p27, mediated through the phosphorylation of threonine-187 in p27, was also inhibited. Consequently, exposure of cells to the inhibitor caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We conclude that specific cyclinE/cyclin A-CDK2 inhibitors can be developed based on the interaction between p27 and cyclin/CDK to block cell cycle progression to prevent tumor growth and survival. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Natural products made by marine cyanobacteria are often highly modified peptides and depsipeptides that have the potential to act as inhibitors for proteases. In the interests of finding new protease inhibition activity and selectivity, grassypeptolide A (1) was screened against a panel of proteases and found to inhibit DPP8 selectively over DPP4. Grassypeptolides were also found to inhibit IL-2 production and proliferation in activated T-cells, consistent with a putative role of DPP8 in the immune system. These effects were also observed in Jurkat cells, and DPP activity in Jurkat cell cytosol was shown to be inhibited by grassypeptolides. In silico docking suggests two possible binding modes of grassypeptolides-at the active site of DPP8 and at one of the entrances to the internal cavity. Collectively these results suggest that grassypeptolides might be useful tool compounds in the study of DPP8 function.",

        "abstract": "Irreversible mitochondrial permeability transition and the resultant cytochrome c release signify the commitment of a cell to apoptotic death. However, the role of transient MPT (tMPT) because of flickering opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore remains elusive. Here we show that tMPT and the associated superoxide flashes (i.e. tMPT/superoxide flashes) constitute early mitochondrial signals during oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Selenite (a ROS-dependent insult) but not staurosporine (a ROS-independent insult) stimulated an early and persistent increase in tMPT/superoxide flash activity prior to mitochondrial fragmentation and a global ROS rise, independently of Bax translocation and cytochrome c release. Selectively targeting tMPT/superoxide flash activity by manipulating cyclophilin D expression or scavenging mitochondrial ROS markedly impacted the progression of selenite-induced apoptosis while exerting little effect on the global ROS response. Furthermore, the tMPT/superoxide flash served as a convergence point for pro- and anti-apoptotic regulation mediated by cyclophilin D and Bcl-2 proteins. These results indicate that tMPT/superoxide flashes act as early mitochondrial signals mediating the apoptotic response during oxidative stress, and provide the first demonstration of highly efficacious local mitochondrial ROS signaling in deciding cell fate.",

        "abstract": "Chemical synthesis is the purposeful execution of one or more reactions to obtain a product, or several products, which could modify the existing molecular frameworks, or make a complex (often natural) molecule from simple reagents. There are several possible reasons to make complex molecules by total chemical synthesis. A century ago the aim was often to identify a molecular structure. With the advent of routine X-ray crystallography and high-field FT NMR in the late 1960s, total chemical synthesis served as a necessary structural confirmation became much less compelling. Another reason that chemists synthesized natural products was because of their useful properties. In some cases, molecules could be cheaper to make from scratch than to obtain from nature source. The history of chemistry is essentially the history of finding out the structure of molecules and of developing new and efficient methods of making them. Putting these molecules to new uses is what underpins our modern world, but it was really a secondary goal for most of chemistry's history. Great synthetic chemists of the mid-to-late twentieth century are revered not so much for what they made but for how they made it. Synthesis cultivates an understanding of the basic principles of chemistry: how and why reactions occur, the relationships between molecular shape and function, and so on. Today, synthetic chemists still need to pursue 'ideality' in the way molecules are synthesized, and total synthesis should be able to provide large quantities of complex natural products with a minimum amount of labor and material expense. In future years, the emphasis of synthetic chemistry, also natural product synthesis, will shift from delivering structures to delivering functions. Natural products will continue to serve a central role in the discovery and development of pharmaceutical agents as well as the elucidation of new biological targets of therapeutic relevance. Synthetic chemists are in a unique position to define those very important molecules that we want, which allow us to access to non-natural derivatives that may offer superior biological and physical properties in comparison to the natural material. The research in natural products synthesis has indeed been the impetus for many fundamental discoveries and could also motivate future research in chemistry and biology. \u00a9 2017, Science Press.

        "abstract": "Black band disease (BBD), a lethal, polymicrobial disease consortium dominated by the cyanobacterium Roseofilum reptotaenium, kills many species of corals worldwide. To uncover chemical signals or cytotoxins that could be important in proliferation of Roseofilum and the BBD layer, we examined the secondary metabolites present in geographically diverse collections of BBD from Caribbean and Pacific coral reefs. Looekeyolide A (1), a 20-membered macrocyclic compound formed by a 16-carbon polyketide chain, 2-deamino-2-hydroxymethionine, and d-leucine, and its autoxidation product looekeyolide B (2) were extracted as major compounds (\u223c1 mg g -1 dry wt) from more than a dozen field-collected BBD samples. Looekeyolides A and B were also produced by a nonaxenic R. reptotaenium culture under laboratory conditions at similar concentrations. R. reptotaenium genomes that were constructed from four different metagenomic data sets contained a unique nonribosomal peptide/polyketide biosynthetic cluster that is likely responsible for the biosynthesis of the looekeyolides. Looekeyolide A, which readily oxidizes to looekeyolide B, may play a biological role in reducing H 2 O 2 and other reactive oxygen species that could occur in the BBD layer as it overgrows and destroys coral tissue. \u00a9 2019 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.",

        "abstract": "A new dimeric macrolide xylopyranoside, cocosolide (1), was isolated from the marine cyanobacterium preliminarily identified as Symploca sp. from Guam. The structure was determined by a combination of NMR spectroscopy, HRMS, X-ray diffraction studies and Mosher's analysis of the base hydrolysis product. Its carbon skeleton closely resembles that of clavosolides A-D isolated from the sponge Myriastra clavosa, for which no bioactivity is known. We performed the first total synthesis of cocosolide (1) along with its [\u03b1,\u03b1]-anomer (26) and macrocyclic core (28), thus leading to the confirmation of the structure of natural 1. The convergent synthesis featured Wadsworth-Emmons cyclopropanation, Sakurai annulation, Yamaguchi macrocyclization/dimerization reaction, \u03b1-selective glycosidation and \u03b2-selective glycosidation. Compounds 1 and 26 potently inhibited IL-2 production in both T-cell receptor dependent and independent manners. Full activity requires the presence of the sugar moiety as well as the intact dimeric structure. Cocosolide also suppressed the proliferation of anti-CD3-stimulated T-cells in a dose-dependent manner. \u00a9 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",

        "abstract": "UCS1025A is a fungal polyketide/alkaloid that displays strong inhibition of telomerase. The structures of UCS1025A and related natural products are featured by a tricyclic furopyrrolizidine connected to a trans-decalin fragment. We mined the genome of a thermophilic fungus and activated the ucs gene cluster to produce UCS1025A at a high titer. Genetic and biochemical analysis revealed a PKS-NRPS assembly line that activates 2S,3S-methylproline derived from l-isoleucine, followed by Knoevenagel condensation to construct the pyrrolizidine moiety. Oxidation of the 3S-methyl group to a carboxylate leads to an oxa-Michael cyclization and furnishes the furopyrrolizidine. Our work reveals a new strategy used by nature to construct heterocyclic alkaloid-like ring systems using assembly line logic. \u00a9 2018 American Chemical Society.",

In particular, this work features the late-stage introduction of sensitive bis(thiazoline) heterocycles and 31-membered macrocyclization conducted at the sterically congested secondary amide site in superb conversion (72 % yield). Biological evaluation indicated that grassypeptolide A significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. It induced cancer cell apoptosis, which was associated with increased cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and decreased expression of bcl-2 and bcl-xL. Furthermore, grassypeptolide A also caused cell cycle redistribution by increasing cells in the G1 phase and decreasing cells in the S and G2 phases. In addition, cell cycle arrest was correlated with downregulation of cyclin D and upregulation of p27 and p21. Cytotoxic activity: Synthesis of grassypeptolide A, an anticancer marine cyclodepsipeptide, in 17 linear steps with an overall yield of 11.3 % is described (see figure). Subsequent biological evaluation indicated that grassypeptolide A significantly inhibited cancer-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Copyright \u00a9 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This highly convergent strategy consists of the synthesis of the two units 10 and 11 and linking them together to form the macrocyclic lactam 31. The upper unit 10 was prepared from tryptophan in five steps, and the lower unit 11 was prepared from glutamic acid in thirteen steps. Conversion of ilamycin F, the most abundant of the cyclopeptides, into the more active congener, ilamycin E, was also accomplished. This would provide sufficient material of ilamycin E for more extensive biological studies.",

It can be formulated as a black-box optimization problem and solved with an efficient search algorithm. This paper proposes a new heuristic search algorithm, Recursive Random Search(RRS), for large-scale network parameter optimization. The RRS algorithm is based on the initial high-efficiency feature of random sampling and it attempts to maintain this high efficiency by constantly \"restarting\" random sampling with adjusted sample spaces. Besides the high efficiency, the RRS algorithm is robust to the effect of random noise and trivial parameters in the objective function because of its root in random sampling. These features are very important for the efficient optimization of network protocol configuration. The performance of RRS is demonstrated with the tests on a suite of benchmark functions. The algorithm has been applied to the configuration of several network protocols, such as RED, OSPF and BGP. One example application in OSPF routing algorithm is presented.",

        "abstract": "Today's Internet relies on a variety of important network protocols. The current parameter configuration process of these protocols is mainly manual and widely considered a black art. This thesis tackles this parameter setting problem by formulating it as a \u201cblack-box\u201d optimization problem. In this approach, we use an on-line simulation system to monitor and simulate the network, and then use a black-box optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of the concerned network protocol. This black-box approach allows flexibility in terms of objectives and metrics of the desired optimization and can be applied to a wide range of network protocols. We first investigate the properties of the underlying optimization problems. The desired optimization algorithm is expected to be highly efficient, scalable to high dimensions and robust to noisy objective functions. Based on these requirements, we propose a Recursive Random Search (RRS) algorithm whose major feature is its basis on random sampling. We empirically validate the advantages of RRS with extensive tests on a suite of benchmark functions and application in some real network optimization problems. To provide a more general solution for practical optimization problems, we also propose a Unified Search Framework (USF), which includes a variety of search techniques as building blocks and can be used as the platform to build tailored optimization strategies by combining a selection of building blocks. Furthermore, USF includes the mechanisms to parallelize search techniques and allocate available computing resources among them such that the resources are optimally utilized. Finally, we investigate the configuration problems of several network protocols, such as, Random Early Drop (RED), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). We formulate these problems into black-box optimization problems, some of which have thousands of parameters. We then apply the optimization techniques developed in this thesis to them. Simulations and experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the on-line simulation system and the proposed optimization techniques.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new heuristic search algorithm, Recursive Random Search(RRS), for black-box optimization problems. Specifically, this algorithm is designed for the dynamical parameter optimization of network protocols which emphasizes on obtaining good solutions within a limited time frame rather than full optimization. The RRS algorithm is based on the initial high-efficiency property of random sampling and attempts to maintain this high-efficiency by constantly \"restarting\" random sampling with adjusted sample spaces. Due to its basis on random sampling, the RRS algorithm is robust to the effect of random noises in the objective function and it performs especially efficiently when handling the objective functions with negligible parameters. These properties have been demonstrated with the tests on a suite of benchmark functions. The RRS algorithm has been successfully applied to the optimal configuration of several network protocols. One application to a network routing algorithm is presented.",

We present an optimization-based approach for this problem without modifying BGP protocol in any way. In this approach, the load balancing problem is generalized as a black-box optimization problem. The Online Simulation system (1), specifically designed for this class of problems, can be applied to adaptively adjust BGP configuration to achieve load balancing. This approach is also very flexible in that other optimization objectives can be used to achieve different TE objectives easily. The simulation results show that the pro- posed scheme substantially improves the load balancing or packet drop probability at the outbound links of a multi-homed AS.",

        "abstract": "As the Internet infrastructure grows to support a variety of services, its legacy protocols are being overloaded with new functions such as traffic engineering. Today, operators engineer such capabilities through clever, but manual parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a back-end support tool for large-scale parameter configuration that is based on efficient parameter state space search techniques and on-line simulation. The framework is useful when the network protocol performance is sensitive to its parameter settings, and its performance can be reasonably modeled in simulation. In particular, our system imports the network topology, relevant protocol models and latest monitored traffic patterns into a simulation that runs on-line in a network operations center (NOC). Each simulation evaluates the network performance for a particular setting of protocol parameters. We propose an efficient large-dimensional parameter state space search technique called \"recursive random search (RRS).\" Each sample point chosen by RRS results in a single simulation. An important feature of this framework is its flexibility: it allows arbitrary choices in terms of the simulation engines used (e.g., ns-2, SSFnet), network protocols to be simulated (e.g., OSPF, BGP), and in the specification of the optimization objectives. We demonstrate the flexibility and relevance of this framework in three scenarios: joint tuning of the RED buffer management parameters at multiple bottlenecks, traffic engineering using OSPF link weight tuning, and outbound load-balancing of traffic at peering/transit points using BGP LOCAL_PREF parameter.",

Nuclear reprogramming is an inefficient process and the molecular mechanisms that reset the epigenetic state during iPSC generation are largely unknown. Here, we show that downregulation of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex is required for efficient reprogramming. Overexpression of Mbd3, a subunit of NuRD, inhibits induction of iPSCs by establishing heterochromatic features and silencing embryonic stem cell-specific marker genes, including Oct4 and Nanog. Depletion of Mbd3, on the other hand, improves reprogramming efficiency and facilitates the formation of pluripotent stem cells that are capable of generating viable chimeric mice, even in the absence of c-Myc or Sox2. The results establish Mbd3/NuRD as an important epigenetic regulator that restricts the expression of key pluripotency genes, suggesting that drug-induced downregulation of Mbd3/NuRD may be a powerful means to improve the efficiency and fidelity of reprogramming.",

        "abstract": "As a critical apoptosis executioner, caspase-3 becomes activated and then enters into the nucleus to exert its function. However, the molecular mechanism of this nuclear entry of active caspase-3 is still unknown. In this study, we revealed that caspase-3 harbors a crm-1-independent nuclear export signal (NES) in its small subunit. Using reverse-caspase-3 as the study model, we found that the function of the NES in caspase-3 was not disturbed by the conformational changes during induced caspase-3 activation. Mutations disrupting the cleavage activity or p3-recognition site resulted in a defect in the nuclear entry of active caspase-3. We provide evidence that the p3-mediated specific cleavage activity of active caspase-3 abrogated the function of the NES. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that during caspase-3 activation, NES is constitutively present. p3-mediated specific cleavage activity abrogates the NES function in caspase-3, thus facilitating the nuclear entry of active caspase-3.",

        "abstract": "LSD1 is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) or embryonic carcinoma/teratocarcinoma (EC) cells. We have previously developed novel LSD1 inhibitors that selectively inhibit ES/EC cells. However, the critical targets of LSD1 remain unclear. Here, we found that LSD1 interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to regulate the proliferation of ES/EC cells through acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16), which we show is a critical substrate of HDAC1. The LSD1 demethylase and HDAC1 deacetylase activities were both inactivated if one of them in the complex was chemically inhibited in ES/EC cells or in reconstituted protein complexes. Loss of HDAC1 phenocopied the selective growth-inhibitory effects and increased the levels of H3K4 methylation and H4K16 acetylation of LSD1 inactivation on ES/EC cells. Reduction of acetylated H4K16 by ablation of the acetyltransferase males absent on the first (MOF) is sufficient to rescue the growth inhibition induced by LSD1 inactivation. While LSD1 or HDAC1 inactivation caused the downregulation of Sox2 and Oct4 and induction of differentiation genes, such as FOXA2 or BMP2, depletion of MOF restored the levels of Sox2, Oct4, and FoxA2 in LSD1-deficient cells. Our studies reveal a novel mechanism by which LSD1 acts through the HDAC1- and MOF-mediated regulation of H4K16 acetylation to maintain the pluripotency of ES/EC cells.",

        "abstract": "Background & Aims Largazole is a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. This study investigated the effects of largazole against liver fibrosis. Methods The in vitro effects of largazole were examined using hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In vivo effects of largazole were studied using a mouse liver fibrotic model induced by CCl4. Results Largazole augmented acetylation of histone H3 (H3) and histone H4 (H4) in HSCs. It directly inhibited the activation of HSCs owing to HDAC inhibitory activity as the antifibrotic effect of largazole was significantly decreased in cells with HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 knockdown. Largazole also induced apoptosis of HSCs. Largazole not only inhibited the expression of TGFR2, but also reduced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Akt induced by TGF-1. Largazole also inhibited the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor. VEGF-induced proliferation of HSCs and activation of Akt and p38MAPK were also suppressed by largazole. In vivo, largazole reduced the expression of collagen I, -smooth muscle actin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in CCl4induced fibrosis, and these antifibrotic effects were associated with increased acetylation of H3 and H4. Largazole also induced HSCs to undergo apoptosis in vivo, which was correlated with downregulation of bcl-2 and bcl-xL. Furthermore, largazole inhibited angiogenesis in vivo as evidenced by reduced expression of CD34, VEGF and VEGFR. In addition to its antifibrotic activity, the drug reduced inflammatory activity in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Conclusions Our findings revealed a novel role of largazole in the treatment of liver fibrosis. Through multiple mechanisms, largazole could be a potentially effective antifibrotic agent.",

        "abstract": "Background & Aims: Nilotinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and other kinases. In this study, we have examined its activity as an anti-fibrotic agent. Methods: The in vitro effect of Nilotinib on rat and human HSCs was assessed using proliferation assays and Western blotting. The in vivo antifibrotic efficacy of Nilotinib was assessed in mice with liver fibrosis induced by CCl(4) and bile duct ligation (BDL). Results: Nilotinib inhibited proliferation, migration, and actin filament formation, as well as the expression of alpha-SMA and collagen in activated HSCs. Nilotinib induced apoptosis of HSCs, which was correlated with reduced bcl-2 expression, increased p53 expression, cleavage of PARP, as well as increased expression of PPAR gamma and TRAIL-R. Nilotinib also induced cell cycle arrest, accompanied by increased expression of p27 and downregulation of cyclin D1. Interestingly, Nilotinib not only inhibited activation of PDGFR, but also TGFRII through Src. Nilotinib significantly inhibited PDGF and TGF beta-simulated phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. Furthermore, PDGF- and TGF beta-activated phosphorylated form(s) of Abl in human HSCs were inhibited by Nilotinib. In vivo, Nilotinib reduced collagen deposition and alpha-SMA expression in CCl(4) and BDL-induced fibrosis. These beneficial effects were associated with suppressed expression of procollagen-(I), TIMP-1, CD31, CD34, VEGF, and VEGFR. Nilotinib could induce HSC undergoing apoptosis in vivo, which was correlated with downregulation of bcl-2. We also observed reduced expression of phosphorylated ERK, Akt, and Abl in the Nilotinib-treated CCl(4) and BDL livers. In addition to its antifibrotic activity, the drug was hepatoprotective and reduced the elevations of ALT and AST after CCl(4) and BDL. Conclusions: These studies uncover a novel role of Bcr-Abl activity in treatment of liver fibrosis through multiple mechanisms and indicate that Nilotinib represents a potentially effective antifibrotic agent.

Here, we show that the expression of LSD1/KDM1 histone demethylase is significantly elevated in Sox2-expressing lung SCCs. LSD1-specific inhibitors selectively impair the growth of Sox2-expressing lung SCCs, but not that of Sox2-negative cells. Sox2 expression is associated with sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition in lung, breast, ovarian, and other carcinoma cells. Inactivation of LSD1 reduces Sox2 expression, promotes G1 cell-cycle arrest, and induces genes for differentiation by selectively modulating the methylation states of histone H3 at lysines 4 (H3K4) and 9 (H3K9). Reduction of Sox2 further suppresses Sox2-dependent lineage-survival oncogenic potential, elevates trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) and enhances growth arrest and cellular differentiation. Our studies suggest that LSD1 serves as a selective epigenetic target for therapy in Sox2-expressing cancers.",

        "abstract": "The CUL4-DDB1-ROC1 ubiquitin E3 ligase regulates cell-cycle progression, replication and DNA damage response(1-4). However, the substrate-specific adaptors of this ligase remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that CUL4-DDB1 complexes interact with multiple WD40-repeat proteins (WDRs) including TLE1-3, WDR5, L2DTL (also known as CDT2) and the Polycomb-group protein EED (also known as ESC). WDR5 and EED are core components of histone methylation complexes that are essential for histone H3 methylation and epigenetic control at K4 or K9 and K27, respectively(5-7), whereas L2DTL regulates CDT1 proteolysis after DNA damage through CUL4-DDB1 (ref. 8). We found that CUL4A-DDB1 interacts with H3 methylated mononucleosomes and peptides. Inactivation of either CUL4 or DDB1 impairs these histone modifications. However, loss of WDR5 specifically affects histone H3 methylation at K4 but not CDT1 degradation, whereas inactivation of L2DTL prevents CDT1 degradation but not histone methylation. Our studies suggest that CUL4-DDB1 ligases use WDR proteins as molecular adaptors for substrate recognition, and modulate multiple biological processes through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.",

PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK) is a pan-VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of PTK/ZK in liver fibrosis. In primary HSCs, PTK/ZK inhibited the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), as well as cell proliferation, migration and actin filament formation. PTK/ZK-induced apoptosis of HSCs, which was correlated with increased caspase-3 activation and suppressed Bcl-2 expression. PTK/ZK also induced cell cycle arrest, accompanied by increasing the expression of p27(Kip1) and downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E. PTK/ZK significantly inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, as well as VEGF-simulated cell proliferation and phosphorylation of Akt in activated HSCs. In a murine fibrotic liver, PTK/ZK attenuated collagen deposition and alpha-SMA expression in carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis in both a 'prevention' and 'treatment' dosing scheme. These beneficial effects were associated with reduced phosphorylation of Akt and suppressed mRNA expression of procollagen-(I), TIMP-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and CD31. These findings provide novel insights into the potential value of blocking VEGF signaling by a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor in treating hepatic fibrosis.",

We provide evidence that PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK), a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), significantly inhibits PDGF receptor expression, as well as PDGF-simulated HSC proliferation, migration and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt and p70S6 kinase. Interestingly, PTK/ZK also antagonizes the TGF-beta1-induced expression of VEGF and VEGFR1. Furthermore, PTK/ZK downregulates TGF-beta receptor expression, which is associated with reduced Akt, ERK and p38MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, PDGF-induced TGF-beta1 expression is inhibited by PTK/ZK. These findings provide evidence that PTK/ZK targets multiple essential pathways of stellate cell activation that provoke proliferation and fibrogenesis. Our study underscores the potential use of PTK/ZK as an antifibrotic drug in chronic liver disease.",

For example, the sequences benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-Pro-Phe-CHO (I) and Cbz-Phe-Ala-CHO (II), which fulfil the known primary and secondary specificity requirements of chymotrypsin and cathepsin B respectively, have been found to be potent reversible inhibitors of their respective target proteinase. Thus I was found to inhibit chymotrypsin with a Ki of approximately 0.8 microM, whereas II exhibits a Ki of approximately 80 nm against cathepsin B. These Ki values are some 10-fold and 3-fold lower than those reported for the corresponding peptide-aldehyde inhibitors of chymotrypsin and cathepsin B upon which the peptidyl-glyoxals were fashioned. Unexpectedly, the sequence Cbz-Pro-Ala-CHO, which was designed to inhibit elastase-like proteinases, exhibited no inhibitory activity towards porcine pancreatic elastase, even when used at concentrations as high as 200 microM.",

        "abstract": "Low-temperature optoelectrical studies of perovskite solar cells using MAPbI3 and mixed-perovskite absorbers implemented into planar and mesoporous architectures reveal fundamental charge transporting properties in fully assembled devices operating under light bias. Both types of devices exhibit inverse correlation of charge carrier lifetime as a function of temperature, extending carrier lifetimes upon temperature reduction, especially after exposure to high optical biases. Contribution of bimolecular channels to overall recombination process should not be overlooked, since the density of generated charge surpasses trap-filling concentration requirements. Bimolecular charge recombination coefficient in both device types is smaller than Langevin theory prediction and its mean value is independent of applied illumination intensity. In planar devices, charge extraction declines upon MAPbI3 transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase, indicating connection between trapping/detrapping mechanism and temperature. Charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage studies further support this assertion, as charge carrier mobility dependence on temperature follows multiple trapping predictions for both device structures. Monotonously increasing trend with rise in the temperature opposes behavior observed in neat perovskite films and indicates importance of transporting layers and effect they have on charge transport in fully assembled solar cells. Low temperature phase transition shows no pattern of influence on thermally activated electron/hole transport.",

        "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO) nanoporous hemispheres (NHSs) with a radius of \u223c200 nm are fabricated by electrospraying a hydrothermally synthesized TiO nanoparticle (NP) suspension solution. The resulting TiO NHSs are highly porous, which are beneficial to the infiltration of perovskites and provide a larger contact area, as building blocks to construct a mesoporous TiO layer for FAMAPb(IBr) based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By varying the TiO NHS collecting period (15 s, 30 s, 60 s and 90 s) during the electrospraying process, the performance of PSCs changes with different TiO NHS distribution densities. The optimized PSC employing TiO NHSs (60 s) exhibits a photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 19.3% with a J of 23.8 mA cm, a V of 1.14 V and a FF of 0.71. Furthermore, the PSC possesses a reproducible PCE value with little hysteresis in its current density-voltage (J-V) curves. The small perturbation transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement reveals a longer free carrier lifetime within the TiO NHS based PSC than that in the TiO NP based PSC, and the time of flight (TOF) photoconductivity measurement shows that charge mobilities in this system are also enhanced. These characteristics make TiO NHSs a promising electron transport material for efficient photovoltaic devices.",

Herein, a FAMAPb(IBr) film has been fabricated with the temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra utilized to determine its exciton binding energy. A \u223c13 meV exciton binding energy is estimated, and a near-unity fraction of free carriers out of the total photoexcitons has been obtained in the solar cell operating regime at equilibrium state. PSCs are fabricated with this mixed perovskite film, but a significant electron transport barrier at the TiO-perovskite interface limited their performance. CsCO and CsI are then utilized as functional enhancers with which to substantially balance the electron and hole transport and increase the carriers (both electrons and holes) mobilities in PSCs, resulting in much-improved solar-cell performance. The modified PSCs exhibit reproducible power conversion efficiency (PCE) values with little hysteresis effect in the J-V curves, achieving PCEs up to 19.5% for the CsCO-modified PSC and 20.6% when subsequently further doped with CsI.",

The free electron diffusion length in CH3NH3PbI3 phase of the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon nanocomposite is observed to almost double that of bare CH3NH3PbI3 and nearly 95% of the photogenerated free holes can inject from CH3NH3PbI3 phase to the carbon nanomaterials.

The calculated free carriers increase with the increase of the total photoexcitation density widening the potential of this material for a broad range of optoelectronics applications.

The optical properties of this single crystal at room and low temperatures were studied in terms of optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements. The single crystal exhibited optical properties with a band-gap of 1.53 eV, which is comparable to a reported value. The temperature-dependent UV-vis spectra of this perovskite single crystal showed a unique structural phase transition as the temperatures varied. The thermoelectric properties of this MAPbI3 single crystal were studied, showing that the Seebeck coefficient of 920 \u00b1 91 \u03bcV K\u22121 almost remained unchanged from room temperature to 330 K and it progressively increased with the increase in temperature and reached 1693 \u00b1 146 \u03bcV K\u22121 at 351 K. In contrast, there was no very clear trend for thermal conductivities with changes in temperature. The thermal conductivities were maintained between 0.30 and 0.42 W m K\u22121 in the temperature range of 298\u2013425 K.

However, the electronic structures and exciton/electron transport mechanism at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface are not fully understood. In this report, simple planar TiO 2 /perovskite heterojunctions are fabricated with different TiO 2  compact layers followed by studies of their effect on the charge extraction/transport properties of the deposited heterojunctions. Efficient perovskite solar cells based on these TiO 2 /perovskite heterojunctions [with CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3  and FA 0.81 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.836 Br 0.15 ) 3  films] have been fabricated and the devices exhibit reproducible efficiency values and good stability. The impact of interfacial potential barrier and TiO 2  surface properties on photogenerated carrier transport mechanisms and overall power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells is investigated by using comprehensive electrical and optical characterization methods such as SEM, XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TRPL, TAS and TPD. Obtained results indicate that efficient device can be fabricated by optimizing of TiO 2  annealing conditions.",

Charge sensitive device architecture is realized through implementation of insulating layer between the anode or cathode to prevent extraction of unwanted type of carriers. Resulting behavior of comparatively efficient mesoporous and planar solar cells exhibits well balanced charge transport with slight dependence of charge mobility on applied laser pulse fluence, for given pulse delay times. Very similar charge carrier mobilities are present within mesoporous devices, whereas holes trail approximately half an order of magnitude behind electrons in planar structured specimens. Moreover, dispersive transport is identified in the electron selective devices with titanium oxide electron transporter, suggesting considerable presence of trapping states at the perovskite interface, whereas no such behavior characterizes planar samples. Variation in delay time between laser pulse and extraction ramp only affects initial charge concentration present within the device, while transient outlay remains unchanged, indicating absence of film charging effect.",

To commercialize the PSCs, further improving the device performance without detrimentally changing the device configuration is important at present. Herein, small amount (5%) of CsI is introduced to form a pinhole-free mixed perovskite light absorption layer in a flexible photovoltaic system with enhanced main photovoltaic parameters of the device, resulting in a ~ 36% enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 8.9% to 12.1% (from 11.3% to 14.6%\u00a0for rigid device). The origins of the enhancement have been studied by exploring the crystal structures, optical absorption, and crystal morphlogies of the synthesised perovskite layers and charge carrier behaviors of the devices. Through small perturbation transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements, the lifetime of the charge carriers are found remarkably increased after the small amount of CsI doping. These characteristics make cation doping of the mixed perovskite layer a promising method in facile tuning of the film quality of the perovskite layer for efficient charge carriers transporting and further boosting the PCE of the devices.",

The resulting hollow rice grain-shaped TiO 2  NSs are highly porous, which are beneficial to the infiltration of perovskites and provide a large contact area, as the building blocks to construct the mesoporous TiO 2  layer for the large-area (the active area is 1\u202fcm 2 ) CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3  based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By varying the spin coating speed (2000\u202frpm, 4000\u202frpm, and 8000\u202frpm, respectively), the performance of PSCs changes with different TiO 2  NSs distribution densities. The optimized PSC employing the 4000\u202frpm spin coating speed exhibits a photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.2% with the short circuit current density ( J   SC  ) of 21.6\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122 , open circuit voltage ( V   OC  ) of 1.07\u202fV and fill factor ( FF ) of 0.61, which is superior to the plain structure based control group with the PCE of 9.6%. Furthermore, the PSC possesses a reproducible PCE value with weak hysteresis in its current density-voltage ( J-V ) curves. Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) measurements and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical simulations reveal the enhanced fast charge carrier extraction/transport and light absorption in the proposed system, which makes electrospun hollow rice grain-shaped TiO 2  NSs a promising electron transportation material for high-efficiency and large-area photovoltaic devices.",

We have demonstrated that PSCs and OSCs with the top Au electrodes fabricated by using the transfer printing method have comparable or better performance than the devices with the top Au electrodes fabricated by using the conventional thermal evaporation method. The highest PCE of the PSCs and OSCs with the top electrodes fabricated using the transfer printing method achieved 13.72% and 2.35%, respectively. It has been investigated that fewer defects between the organic thin films and Au electrodes exist by using the transfer printing method which improved the device stability. After storing the PSCs and OSCs with the transfer-printed electrodes in a nitrogen environment for 97 and 103 days without encapsulation, the PSCs and OSCs still retained 71% and 91% of their original PCEs, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Many routes are developed to prepare ultrastable electrode materials for Li-ion batteries (LIBs), whereas it is effective but still challenge to design promising ones through exposed facet engineering route. Here, graphene-SnO 2  material is selected as a potential candidate due to its high theoretical capacity and conductivity. The  ab initio  density functional theory (DFT) calculations are firstly used here to predict the possible property of SnO 2  materials with different exposed facets: (211) facet is found to have the relatively high surface energy and a lower energy barrier towards Li +  when compared with other planes. Then the graphene-SnO 2  nanorods with highly exposed (211) facets (GSn-211) is fabricated by utilizing a crystalline-spacing-matching method. When tested as anode for LIBs, GSn-211 indeed shows a great electrochemical property: ultrastable cycling stability (695\u202fmAh/g at 0.2\u202fA/g after even 500 cycles) and an outstanding rate capability (530\u202fmAh/g at 5\u202fA/g). The Li-ions anisotropic transport and the atomic-scale ledged behaviors of GSn-211 along (211) are further visualized via an  in situ  TEM at atomic level, in which the Sn/O atoms-peeling-off through (211) facet is observed. This indicates (211) planes hold high active sites towards Li-ions insertion, leading to a fast Li +  storage. Combined with theoretical calculations, their atomistic mechanical properties during lithiation are explored: the decrease of bulk modulus means the GSn-211 is softened after the initial lithiated state leads to better structural stability. These findings provide a novel perspective for the advanced anode design for LIBs  via  the exposed facet engineering method.",

When tested as anodes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the concave dodecahedral carbons (CDCs) show much enhanced capacity (\u223c2 times) and improved rate capability (603 mA h g\u22121 at 2000 mA g\u22121), when compared with the perfect ones without curved planes (PDCs, 280 mA h g\u22121). The curving effects of CDCs on Li ion storage are further investigated by constructing a CDC particle-based nanobattery device in an in situ transmission electron microscope (TEM). During the lithiation process of CDCs, the spacing in the curved parts expands much more than the perfect ones (from 0.5 nm to 0.7 nm), providing increasing active sites for Li ion storage. And the stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and structural integrity for CDCs are also visualized during the discharge process, in good agreement with their ultralong cycle life. This design concept, enhancing curved parts in the structures, provides guidance in the development of next-generation advanced electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Precise control of crystal orientations and macroscopic morphology of a perovskite crystal is crucial for various optoelectronic applications relying on charge carrier transport tuning along exposed crystal facets. Here, taking methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) as an example, and employing a novel crystal facet engineering method, we successfully construct two kinds of perovskite crystals with exposed {001} and {110} facets. We find that the free carriers\u2019 photoluminescence lifetime on the {001} facets can be 3 times longer than that on {110} facets. The related mechanisms are investigated via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and in situ transmission electron microscopy. These indicate that the different trap state density of exposed facets and crystal structure changing of CH3NH3PbBr3 under light and electron beam irradiation lead to the differences in carrier transport along different facets. By distinguishing the charge carrier transport on different CH3NH3PbBr3 exposed facets, micro-photodetectors have been constructed. A device fabricated with the {001} exposed facets exhibited two orders of magnitude higher photocurrent and half as much dark current as a {110} facet-based device. Thus, the crystal facet engineering of perovskites can be widely adopted for understanding physical/chemical properties of perovskite crystals and provides great potential for novel perovskite optoelectronic device applications.",

Previous literatures mainly demonstrated that much higher specific capacitance of NiCo2S4 than that of NiCo2O4 was ascribed to the higher electronic conductivity. However, we argue that only a small amount of capacitance can be induced by the electronic conductivity, while the significance of electrochemical active species in these system has long been ignored. Here, we propose that geometrical-site-dependent pseudocapacitive activity will generate enhanced specific capacitance through the interface structural design. It reveals that specific capacitance of NiCo2S4 (1862 F g-1 at 4 A g-1) is 50% higher than that of NiCo2O4 (1230 F g-1 at 4 A g-1), which is derived from the designed increase of Co2+Td ions (cobalt ions in the tetrahedral site) in NiCo2S4. These results have significant implications for the design and optimization of the electrochemical properties of transition metal based pseudocapacitors.",

In this paper, fluorinated perylene diimide (FPDI) was used as novel organic electron transport material in planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. The perovskite film was fabricated by sequential vacuum vapor deposition, and the film morphology could be controlled by optimizing the FPDI film morphology with short time solvent spin-coating or solvent vapor annealing (SVA). Dense and uniform perovskite film with high substrate coverage could be obtained when the FPDI film was treated by chloroform SVA for half an hour, and the fill factor (FF) of the perovskite solar cell increased from 30.44% to 55.20%, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.23% to 7.44%. The PCE of the best device reached 7.93%, which was comparable to that (8.25%) of the conventional ZnO electron transport layer based perovskite device prepared by the same method.",

        "abstract": "Thiocyanate ammonium (NH4SCN) is introduced into the fabrication of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) films through one-step spin-coating. The promoted formation of black trigonal phase \u03b1-FAPbI3 with better crystallinity has been observed after the addition of NH4SCN, together with the supression of the formation of yellow hexagonal phase \u03b4-FAPbI3. Planar perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on NH4SCN-assisted formed \u03b1-FAPbI3 films with high quality present a highest power conversion efficiency of 11.44% when 30 mol% NH4SCN is applied. Notably, the addition of NH4SCN is found to enhance the moisture stability of the perovskite. As a result, the planar PVSCs with 30 mol% NH4SCN additive show improved stability under ambient conditions (RH: 30\u201340%) over those based on pristine FAPbI3. NH4SCN simultaneously enhances the efficiency and moisture stability of FAPbI3 based PVSCs through a single one-step solution method, facilitating their commercial fabrication and application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A solution-processed CuO  x   film has been successfully integrated as the hole-transporting layer (HTL) for inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The CuO  x   layer is fabricated by simply spin-coating a copper acetylacetonate (Cu(acac) 2 ) chloroform solution onto ITO glass with high transparency in the visible range. The compact and pinhole-free perovskite film with large grain domains is grown on the CuO  x   film. The inverted PVSCs with the structure of ITO/CuO  x  /MAPbI 3 /PC 61 BM/ZnO/Al are fabricated and show a best PCE of 17.43% under standard AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation with a  V  OC  of 1.03\u00a0V, a  J  SC  of 22.42\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122 , and a fill factor of 0.76, which is significantly higher and more stable than that fabricated from the often used hole-transporting material PEDOT:PSS (11.98%) under the same experimental conditions. The enhanced performance is attributed to the efficient hole extraction through the CuO  x   layer as well as the high-quality CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3  films grown on the CuO  x  . Our results indicate that low-cost and solution-processed CuO  x   film is a promising HTL for high performance PVSCs with better stability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Synthetic calcite single crystals, due to their strong crystal habit, tend to grow into characteristic rhombohedra. In the nature, biogenic calcite crystals form composites together with biomacromolecular materials, spurring investigations of how the growing calcite single crystals change their habit to satisfy the curvature of the organic phase. In this work, we examine calcite crystallization on a flat surface of glass slide and a curved surface of polystyrene (PS) sphere. The crystals exhibit tiny contact area onto the glass substrate that is averagely only 15% of their projected area on the substrate. In sharp contrast, the contact area greatly increase to above 75% of the projected area, once magnesium ions or agarose gel networks are introduced into the crystallization media. Furthermore, the calcite crystals form rough and step-like interfaces with a curved surface. However, the interfaces become smooth and curved as the crystals grow in presence of magnesium ions or agarose gel networks. The discrepancy between the interfacial structures implies kinetic effects of the additives on the crystallization around the surfaces. This work may provide implications for understanding the formation mechanisms of single-crystal composite materials.",

        "abstract": "Lead halide complexes are efficient precursors to obtain high quality perovskite films and high performance solar cells. However, how the lead halide complex affects the crystallization kinetics and thus the film quality of perovskite has not been systematically studied. Herein, two PbI2(X) complexes with different coordination strength of ligand X in complexation with PbI2 (PbI2(DMF) and PbI2(DMSO)) are synthesized. The correlation between the morphology, evolution of the perovskite formation, defects state, carrier lifetime and the subsequent photovoltaic performance are investigated in details via a two-step coating method with various PbI2(X) complexes. We find that PbI2(DMSO) derived perovskite film shows larger grains and vertically oriented grain boundaries as well as enhanced photoluminescence intensity and longer carrier lifetime. As a result, highly efficient inverted planar perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency up to 17.0% are achieved from PbI2(DMSO) complex under 1 sun illumination. This research could open up a new pathway to further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells through the control of perovskite crystallization kinetics by choosing proper PbI2(X) complex precursors.",

Herein, PbI2/gel single-crystal composites have been successfully prepared. Diffuse reflectance spectra show a clear increase in the band gap of PbI2 after gel incorporation. The band gap is further increased through expanding the area of host/guest interfaces or enhancing the interatomic forces at the interfaces. The interatomic forces (electrostatic interaction) at the host/guest interfaces are attributed to this band gap shift. As such, this study provides a novel and facile way for band gap engineering by gel incorporation.",

        "abstract": "Reversible electrodeposition-based electrochromic devices are highly promising for extensive applications owing to their facile and low-cost fabrication. Herein, a novel electrodeposition-based electrochromic device with reversible three-state optical transformation, i.e. transparent, mirror, and black, was fabricated by introducing a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode modified with commonly available and inexpensive titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles. Typically, the fabricating strategy mainly involved three procedures, namely obtaining a stable dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles by milling, achieving a surface modification of the FTO electrode with TiO2 nanoparticles by spin-coating and sintering, and assembling the device by sandwiching gel electrolyte between the modified FTO electrode and a flat FTO electrode. By applying different voltages for a short while, this transparent smart device can be immediately switched to black (+2.5 V/20 s) or mirror (\u22122.5 V/20 s) state by depositing Ag on the surface of the modified or unmodified FTO electrode respectively. There is below 1% transmittance in the black state and over 80% reflectance in the mirror state for the device. By changing the surface structure of the TiO2 modified FTO electrode, the optical properties of the device in different states can be controlled effectively. Moreover, the optical transformation exhibited good stability over 1500 cycles of testing.",

        "abstract": "Organic-inorganic perovskite as a promising candidate for solar energy harvesting has attracted immense interest for its low-cost preparation and extremely high quantum efficiency. However, the fundamental understanding of the photophysics in perovskite remains elusive. In this work, we have revealed two distinct states in MAPbI thin films at low temperature through time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL). In particular, we observed a photo-induced carrier injection from the high energy (HE) state to the low energy (LE) state which has a longer lifetime. The strong interaction between the two states, evidenced by the injection kinetics, can be sensitively controlled through the excitation power. Understanding of the interacting two-states not only sheds light on the long PL lifetime in perovskite but also helps to understand the different behavior of perovskite in response to different excitation power. Further efforts in modifying the low energy state could significantly improve the quantum efficiency and lead to novel application in optoelectronics based on perovskite.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we report the tunable emission properties of Ce(3+) in an apatite-type LiY9(SiO4)6O2 compound via adjusting the doping concentration or temperature. The occupancies of Ce(3+) ions at two different sites (Wyckoff 6h and 4f sites) in LiY9(SiO4)6O2 have been determined by Rietveld refinements. Two kinds of Ce(3+) f-d transitions have been studied in detail and then assigned to certain sites. The effects of temperature and doping concentration on Ce(3+) luminescence properties have been systematically investigated. It is found that the Ce(3+) ions prefer occupying Wyckoff 6h sites and the energy transfer between Ce(3+) at two sites becomes more efficient with an increase in doping concentration. In addition, the charge-transfer vibronic exciton (CTVE) induced by the existence of free oxygen ion plays an important role in the thermal quenching of Ce(3+) at 6h sites. Because of the tunable emissions from cyan to blue with increasing temperature, the phosphors LiY9(SiO4)6O2:Ce(3+) are endowed with possible thermometric applications.",

To get insight into the structure-luminescence relationship, the impact of incorporation of Sr(2+) on structure of (Ca,Sr)2Al2SiO7 was first investigated via Rietveld refinement of high quality X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, and then the VUV-UV excitation and UV-vis emission spectra of (Ca,Sr)2Al2SiO7:Ce(3+) were collected at low temperature. The results reveal that the crystal structure evolution of (Ca,Sr)2Al2SiO7:Ce(3+) has influences on band gaps and Ce(3+) luminescence properties including 4f-5di (i = 1-5) transition energies, radiative lifetime, emission intensity, quantum efficiency, and thermal stability. Moreover, the influence of Sr(2+) content on the energy of Eu(3+)-O(2-) charge-transfer states (CTS) in (Ca,Sr)2Al2SiO7:Eu(3+) was studied in order to construct vacuum referred binding energy (VRBE) schemes with the aim to further understand the luminescence properties of (Ca,Sr)2Al2SiO7:Ce(3+).

        "abstract": "Time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS), based on the laser-pump/X-ray-probe method, is powerful in capturing the change of the geometrical and electronic structure of the absorbing atom upon excitation. TR-XAS data analysis is generally performed on the laser-on minus laser-off difference spectrum. Here, a new analysis scheme is presented for the TR-XAS difference fitting in both the extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) and the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) regions. R-space EXAFS difference fitting could quickly provide the main quantitative structure change of the first shell. The XANES fitting part introduces a global non-derivative optimization algorithm and optimizes the local structure change in a flexible way where both the core XAS calculation package and the search method in the fitting shell are changeable. The scheme was applied to the TR-XAS difference analysis of Fe(phen)3 spin crossover complex and yielded reliable distance change and excitation population.",

        "abstract": "Copper compounds involved in photocatalysis have recently spurred considerable interest for their novel transformations. However, mechanistic investigations are still in infancy. We find a new type of reaction, that is, Cu(II) salt\u2013catalyzed C\u2013H functionalization of aromatic amines triggered by visible light irradiation. An array of mechanistic observations, including high-resolution mass spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum, electron spin resonance, x-ray absorption near-edge structure, and density functional theory calculation, have identified the key intermediates generated in situ in the transformation. Integration of single-electron transfer, singlet oxygen (1O2), and new absorption species, intermediate I and intermediate II formed in situ from Cu(II) salts and substrate amines or imines, respectively, is responsible for the N\u2013H and C\u2013H bond activation of secondary amines to couple with nucleophiles in air, thereby leading to the formation of quinoline, indolo[3,2-c]quinoline, \u03b2-amino acid, and 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives in moderate to good yields under visible light irradiation at room temperature.",

However, the molecular basis for the assembly of the Shu complex and its functional role in DNA repair is still elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of the yeast Shu complex, revealing that Csm2, Psy3, Shu1 and Shu2 interact with each other in sequence to form a V-shape overall structure. Shu1 adopts a structure resembling the ATPase core domain of Rad51 and represents a new Rad51 paralog. Shu2 assumes a novel structural fold consisting of a conserved zinc-finger containing SWIM domain and a small insertion domain. The functional roles of the key residues are validated using mutagenesis and in vitro pull-down and in vivo yeast growth studies. Structural analysis together with available biological data identifies two potential DNA-binding sites, one of which might be responsible for binding the ssDNA region of the 3'-overhang DNA and the other for the dsDNA region. Collectively, these findings reveal the molecular basis for the assembly of the Shu complex and shed new insight on its functional role in homologous recombination.",

A series of biogeochemical processes related to methane lead to the formation of authigenic carbonate minerals. In this study, a self-built experimental device was used to study the formation process of carbonate minerals under cold seep conditions. The concentrations of pore water chemicals, HCO and Ca at different heights of the reactor under flow conditions can be observed. According to the experimental results, the formation process of carbonate minerals under cold seep conditions was estimated, that 1 m carbonate growth needs 12,000 and 7000 years, respectively, under fast (5 mL\u00b7min) and slow emission (1 mL\u00b7min) conditions. Furthermore, TOUGHREACT was used to simulate the diagenesis process. A 1D unsteady react-transport model was developed, and the experimental data was used to constrain the simulation. The results of simulation show that the carbonates need 17,000 and 9700 years to grow 1 m under the condition of fast and slow flow scenarios, respectively. The results of this work will contribute to the study of foundation on the formation of authigenic minerals in cold seep areas, and for the physical properties of sedimentary media as well.",

        "abstract": "Pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) is one of the most important enzymes in C4 photosynthesis. PPDK regulatory protein (PDRP) regulates the Pi-dependent activation and ADP-dependent inactivation of PPDK by reversible phosphorylation. PDRP shares no significant sequence similarity with other protein kinases or phosphatases. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which PDRP carries out its dual and competing activities, we determined the first crystal structure of PDRP from maize (Zea mays). PDRP forms a compact homo-dimer in which each protomer contains two separate N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains. The CTD includes several key elements for performing both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation activities: the P-loop for binding the ADP and inorganic phosphate substrates, residues Lys274 and Lys299 for neutralizing the negative charge, and residue Asp277 for protonating and deprotonating the target threonine residue of PPDK to promote nucleophilic attack. Surprisingly, the NTD shares the same protein fold as the CTD, and also includes a putative P-loop with AMP bound but lacking enzymatic activities. Structural analysis indicated that this loop may participate in the interaction with and regulation of PPDK. The NTD has conserved intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds for PDRP dimerization. Moreover, PDRP is the first structure of the DUF299 (domain of unknown function 299) enzyme family. This study provides a structural basis for understanding the catalytic mechanism of PDRP and offers a foundation for development of selective activators or inhibitors that regulate photosynthesis.",

        "abstract": "The lack of floor plans is a critical reason behind the current sporadic availability of indoor localization service. Service providers have to go through effort-intensive and time-consuming business negotiations with building operators, or hire dedicated personnel to gather such data. In this paper, we propose Jigsaw, a floor plan reconstruction system that leverages crowdsensed data from mobile users. It extracts the position, size, and orientation information of individual landmark objects from images taken by users. It also obtains the spatial relation between adjacent landmark objects from inertial sensor data, then computes the coordinates and orientations of these objects on an initial floor plan. By combining user mobility traces and locations where images are taken, it produces complete floor plans with hallway connectivity, room sizes, and shapes. It also identifies different types of connection areas (e.g., escalators and stairs) between stories, and employs a refinement algorithm to correct detection errors. Our experiments on three stories of two large shopping malls show that the 90-percentile errors of positions and orientations of landmark objects are about 1~2m and 5~9, while the hallway connectivity and connection areas between stories are 100 percent correct.",

A mixture of Pd acetylacetonate (Pd(acac)2), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and nonfunctionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was electrospun and thermally treated to produce Pd/CNF-MWCNT catalysts. The addition of MWCNTs with a mass loading of 1.0-2.5 wt % (to PAN) significantly improved nitrite reduction activity compared to the catalyst without MWCNT addition. The results of CO chemisorption confirmed that the addition of MWCNTs increased Pd exposure on CNFs and hence improved catalytic activity. ",

In the present study, we developed novel carbon nanofibrous scaffolds by annealing electrospun mats at elevated temperature. The resultant scaffold showed a cohesive structure and excellent mechanical flexibility. The graphitic structure generated by annealing renders superior electrical conductivity to the carbon nanofibrous scaffold. By integrating the conductive scaffold with biphasic electrical stimulation, neural stem cell proliferation was promoted associating with upregulated neuronal gene expression level and increased microtubule-associated protein 2 immunofluorescence, demonstrating an improved neuronal differentiation and maturation. The findings suggest that the integration of the conducting carbon nanofibrous scaffold and electrical stimulation may pave a new avenue for neural tissue regeneration.",

        "title": "Development of palladium-resin composites for catalytic hydrodechlorination of 4-chlorophenol",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Polymeric resins have been widely used for the removal of halogenated compounds, however, the sustainability of resin adsorption is compromised by frequent resin regeneration and further treatment/disposal of concentrated brine. Palladium (Pd)-based catalytic hydrogenation is promising to treat various classes of contaminants, including halogenated compounds, and the development of Pd-polymeric resin composites is advantageous because the composites can convert halogenated compounds to less toxic chemicals  in situ  and mitigate challenges associated with resin regeneration. In this work, three neutral resins (MN200, MN100, and XAD4) and two anion exchange resins (IRA910 and IRA96) were used as Pd supports to evaluate 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) hydrodechlorination reactivity. Similar 4-CP adsorption and reduction kinetics were observed, i.e., adsorption and reduction were both faster at acidic pHs for the neutral resins but faster at basic pHs for the anionic resins. The developed Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood kinetic model based on surface reaction as the rate determining step also suggested an enhancing effect of adsorption on the catalytic reactivity. When adsorption was constant, the reactivity of the catalysts increased with increasing solution pH. This is because higher pH mitigates the adverse impacts of the dehalogenation products (i.e., H +  and Cl \u2212 ) on the catalytic reaction. The inhibition effect of Cl \u2212  was more pronounced on IRA910 than on MN200. IRA910 with anion exchange functional groups facilitates Cl \u2212  adsorption and promotes the production of PdCl 3  \u2212  and PdCl 4  2\u2212  species, which are inactive for catalytic reduction. The accumulation of phenol, the dominant product in 4-CP reduction, on resin resulted in catalytic activity loss over eight cycles when 4-CP was repeatedly spiked into the same reactor; the catalytic activity was largely restored after resin regeneration.",

        "title": "Sustainable and scalable natural fiber welded palladium-indium catalysts for nitrate reduction",
        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, we demonstrate the production of reactive, robust, sustainable catalysts for water treatment created through  Natural Fiber Welding  (NFW) of lignocellulose-supported palladium-indium (Pd-In) nanoparticles onto linen yarns. First, Pd-In catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness onto ball-milled powders of linen. Our process preserved the lignocellulose, yielding small (5\u201310\u00a0nm), near-spherical crystalline nanoparticles of Pd-In alloy and a uniform Pd-In metal composition throughout the fibers. Nitrate reduction tests identified the existence of an optimum Pd-In catalyst composition (5\u00a0wt% Pd and 1.2\u00a0wt% In with respect to lignocellulose) for maximum reactivity; the most reactive Pd-In catalyst was 10 times more reactive than the best performing Pd-Cu nanoparticles deposited on lignocellulose using the same approach. This improved performance was most likely due to more uniform distribution of alloyed Pd-In nanoparticles throughout the support. Nitrate reduction tests and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling of aged Pd-In catalysts showed that they remained stable and lost no reactivity during extended storage in air at room temperature. Next, the optimized Pd-In catalyst was fiber-welded onto linen yarns, using a custom-built yarn-coating system and a novel, scalable process that controlled catalyst loading, delivering a Pd-In catalyst coating onto the yarn surface. This fiber-welded Pd-In catalyst yarn was integrated into a novel water treatment reactor and evaluated during four months and more than 180\u00a0h of nitrate reduction tests in ultrapure water. During this evaluation, the fiber-welded catalysts maintained their reactivity with negligible metal leaching. When tested in raw or (partially) treated drinking water and wastewater, the fiber-welded catalysts were robust and stable, and their performance was not significantly impacted by constituents in the complex waters (e.g. alkalinity, organic matter). Our research demonstrates an innovative, scalable approach through NFW to design and implement robust, sustainable lignocellulose-supported catalysts with enhanced reactivity capable of water purification in complex water chemistries.",

One concern of such technology is the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) during the pre-chlorination process. For the SWRO tested in this study, the concentrations of trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and haloacetonitriles (HANs) increased by 35.1, 23.7 and 4.9\u03bcg/L, respectively, after a seawater sample (with UV/DOC of 3.7L/mg\u00b7m and Br of 50.9mg/L) was pre-chlorinated (1-2mg-Cl/L). The dissolved organic matter (DOM) with molecular weight (MW) <1kDa dominated the formation of total THMs, HAAs and HANs. To further investigate DBPs precursors in the seawater, the DOM with MW<1kDa was fractionated to hydrophobic acids (HOA), hydrophobic bases (HOB), hydrophobic neutrals (HON), and hydrophilic substances (HIS). The excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra analysis showed that most aromatic protein and fulvic acid of the DOM with MW<1kDa were present in the HON and HIS fractions. The HON fraction was the dominant precursor to form THMs and HAAs, while HIS controlled the formation of HANs. Furthermore, bromo - DBPs dominated the total DBPs yields after the chlorination of HIS fraction.",

        "abstract": "The reverse osmosis process is widely used for seawater desalination, whereas the pre-chlorination step for controlling membrane biofouling results in undesirable disinfection by-products, such as halophenols (HPs) which are not yet regulated but of increasing concerns. The formation and speciation of HPs during chlorination of three filtered seawater samples (SA, SB, and SC) with various phenol concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 1.0\u00a0mg/L) were evaluated. 4-Bromophenol (4-BrP), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TClP), 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBrP), and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBrP) were identified during chlorination, with 2,4,6-TBrP as the predominant HP. Ozone as a common oxidant in water and wastewater treatment was subsequently applied to assess its effect in dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its ability of reducing HP precursors in the seawater samples. An initial ozone dose of 5\u00a0mg O/L was capable of reducing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in SA, and UV absorbance at 254\u00a0nm (UV) in SB, whereas it induced an elevation of UV in SC. When ozone dose increased to 10\u00a0mg O/L, the DOC and UV levels in all seawater samples were reduced. Ozone was more powerful on degrading DOM with molecular weight (MW) of near 1000\u00a0Da than those with MW of 20-100\u00a0Da, both of which composed the majority of DOM in the seawater samples. As determined by excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy, the most ozone-susceptible fraction of DOM was soluble microbial by-product-like substances, while the least was tryptophan-like aromatic proteins. Despite that the initial ozone of 5\u00a0mg O/L was less effective in DOM degradation than the higher dose, it successfully degraded HP precursors. By pre-ozonation at 5\u00a0mg O/L, no chlorophenol was detected during chlorination, and the mean reductions of the three bromophnols formed were above 92% in all seawater samples, with the reduction of 2,4,6-TBrP being the highest of 99.7, 99.6, and 99.1% in SA, SB, and SC, respectively.",

The treatment of ROC from an mWRRO using granular activated carbon (GAC) combined pretreatment of coagulation was optimized and evaluated. Among the three coagulants tested, ferric chloride (FeCl3) presented relatively higher DOC removal efficiency than polyaluminium chloride and lime at the same dosage and coagulation conditions. The removal efficiency of DOC, genotoxicity, and antiestrogenic activity concentration of the ROC could achieve 16.9, 18.9, and 39.7\u00a0%, respectively, by FeCl3 coagulation (with FeCl3 dosage of 180.22\u00a0mg/L), which can hardly reduce UV254 and genotoxicity normalized by DOC of the DOM with MW <5\u00a0kDa. However, the post-GAC adsorption column (with filtration velocity of 5.7\u00a0m/h, breakthrough point adsorption capacity of 0.22\u00a0mg DOC/g GAC) exhibited excellent removal efficiency on the dominant DOM fraction of MW <5\u00a0kDa in the ROC. The removal efficiency of DOC, UV254, and TDS in the ROC was up to 91.8, 96, and 76.5\u00a0%, respectively, by the FeCl3 coagulation and post-GAC adsorption. Also, the DOM with both genotoxicity and antiestrogenic activity were completely eliminated by the GAC adsorption. The results suggest that GAC adsorption combined pretreatment of FeCl3 coagulation as an efficient method to control organics, genotoxicity, and antiestrogenic activity in the ROC from mWRRO system.

Although a coupling reaction between a macrolide ketone and the side chain substituted sulfone, at C(27-28) was not successful, a Wadsworth-Emmons olefination involving the oxane methyl ketone 4 and an oxazole produced the oxane 90 which was next coupled to 91 leading to the C(20-46) unit 100. A further coupling of 100 to 71c at C(19-20) then led to 105, ultimately, and the synthesis was completed by a macrocyclisation reaction from 105, at the C(2-3) alkene bond, followed by deprotection of 106.",

        "abstract": "The recent development of the Internet of Things and related sensor technologies has greatly impacted logistics tracking, structural health monitoring, environmental analysis, and data extraction. It is highly imperative to develop a technology to allow the sensor node to operate independently, sustainably, and in a maintenance-free way by harvesting energy from the ambient environment. Here we demonstrate a triboelectric device as a highly efficient and durable kinetic energy harvester from ubiquitous mechanical vibrations. We construct a cylinder coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and place a number of metal balls inside the cylinder. This ball-based triboelectric generator (B-TEG) converts the mechanical shaking into electricity. By grounding the metal-freestanding-layer, we form a new configuration (B-GTEG). The output power of B-GTEG shows an 8 fold improvement through the electrophorus effect compared with B-TEG, providing the potential for supplying sustainable power to wireless sensor nodes.",

        "abstract": "Sand dunes are the main landforms in modern deserts worldwide. As an important type of desert vegetation, herbaceous plants have long been acknowledged for their important ecological functions. We focus on the dune-scale distribution pattern of herbaceous plants and their relationship with the environment. During the early summer of 2010, the herbaceous plant density, coverage, aboveground biomass and eighteen environmental factors were surveyed from 214 plots (5m\u00d75m) across two linear sand dunes (220m\u00d7110m) located in the Gurbantunggut Desert, China, a typical saline-alkali desert in Central Asia. Data were analyzed using univariate, ordination, and geostatistical techniques. Three vegetation variables represent a significant clumped distribution (P<0.01) across the entire study site. Obvious differences were observed among different slope positions/transects, with the lowest values observed at the summit. Geostatistics indicated that all of the variables showed a moderate spatial dependence and obvious zonal distribution along the sand dunes. The ranges (lag distance) of density (32.2m) and coverage (33.5m) were close to the average width (31.4m) of the transects. The biomass range (74.1m) was almost equal to the average width (75m) of the sand dunes. Pearson's correlation analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis consistently demonstrated that the distributions of herbs on sand dunes were dominantly influenced by sand dune topography (slope position, convexity, and relative height), soil nutrients (total nitrogen and phosphorus) and deep-rooted shrubbery (Ephedra distachya). Compared to large, mobile and steep sand dunes, low, fixed and gentle sand dunes contribute to herbaceous plant abundance and distribution as well as the stability maintenance of the whole desert ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the major nutrients that constrain plant growth and development, as well as the structure and function of ecosystems. Hence, leaf N and P patterns can contribute to a deep understanding of plant nutrient status, nutrient limitation type of ecosystems, plant life-history strategy and differentiation of functional groups. However, the status and pattern of leaf N and P stoichiometry in N-deficiency desert ecosystems remain unclear. Under this context, the leaf samples from 57 plant species in the Karamori Mountain Ungulate Nature Reserve, eastern Junggar Desert, China were investigated and the patterns and interrelations of leaf N and P were comparatively analyzed. The results showed that the average leaf N concentration, P concentration, and N:P ratio were 30.81 mg/g, 1.77 mg/g and 17.72, respectively. This study found that the leaf N concentration and N:P ratio were significantly higher than those of studies conducted at global, national and regional scales; however, the leaf P concentration was at moderate level. Leaf N concentration was allometrically correlated with leaf P and N:P ratio across all species. Leaf N, P concentrations and N:P ratio differed to a certain extent among plant functional groups. C4 plants and shrubs, particularly shrubs with assimilative branches, showed an obviously lower P concentration than those of C3 plants, herbs and shrubs without assimilative branches. Shrubs with assimilative branches also had lower N concentration. Fabaceae plants had the highest leaf N, P concentrations (as well as Asteraceae) and N:P ratio; other families had a similar N, P-stoichiometry. The soil in this study was characterized by a lack of N (total N:P ratio was 0.605), but had high N availability compared with P (i.e. the available N:P ratio was 1.86). This might explain why plant leaves had high N concentration (leaf N:P ratiou003e16). In conclusion, the desert plants in the extreme environment in this study have formed their intrinsic and special stoichiometric characteristics in relation to their life-history strategy.",

The N-Methyl- N-nitrosourea (MNU) is an alkylating toxicant which could induce photoreceptor apoptosis resembling that of the hereditary RP. However, the detailed process pattern of this degeneration remains poorly characterized. We systemically explored the topography of the photoreceptor degeneration in the MNU treated mouse, and related these spatial data with the time-dependent characteristics of retinal pathology. These temporal topographic data delineated sequential scenes of the progressive photoreceptor degeneration in the MNU treated retinas: focal photoreceptors showed different vulnerabilities to the MNU toxicity and displayed a distinctive spatial- and time-dependent progression. Moreover, the positional asymmetry between the retinal quadrants firstly provided instructive information about the unique toxicology properties of the MNU. Further mechanism study suggested that the up-regulation of Bax and Calpain-2, rather than the Caspase-3, should be responsible for the asymmetry in the MNU induced photoreceptor degeneration. Together with the comparative sensitivities to the neurotoxicity of MNU between two photoreceptor populations, these topographic data would facilitate the standardization of analytic parameters related to the MNU induced RP model, and enhance its application in the therapeutic explorations of human RP.",

        "abstract": "Retina is a critical component of the central nerve system that is responsible for the conversion of light stimulus into electrical spikes. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) comprises a heterogeneous group of inherited retinal dystrophies leading to blindness. We examined retinal neuroglobin (Ngb) expression in a pharmacologically induced RP animal model, the N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) administered mice. The retinal Ngb expression in MNU administered mice attenuated following a time dependent manner, suggesting Ngb was involved in the photoreceptor degeneration. Conversely, the intravenous delivery of Hemin, a Ngb up-regulator, enhanced the Ngb expressions in the retinas of MNU administered mice. Optokinetic behavioral tests and Electroretinogram (ERG) examination suggested that the Hemin treatment could improve the visual function of MNU administered mice. The retinal morphology of the Hemin treated group was much more intact than the MNU group as evidenced by retinal sections and optical coherence tomography (OCT) examinations. Moreover, immunostaining experiments showed the cone photoreceptors in the MNU administered mice were also rescued by Hemin treatment. Furthermore, mechanism studies suggested the Hemin treatment not only alleviated the oxidative stress, but also rectified the apoptotic changes in the retinas of MNU administered mice. In conclusion, the intraperitoneally delivery of Hemin can enhance the Ngb expressions in the MNU administered retinas, thereby ameliorating the photoreceptor degeneration and associated visual impairments. These findings would shed light on the opportunity to develop Ngb into a therapeutic molecular against RP.",

The N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-administered mouse is used as a pharmacologically induced RD animal model in various therapeutic investigations. The present study found the retinal neuroglobin (NGB) expression in the MNU-administered mice was significantly lower than in normal controls, suggesting NGB was correlated with RD. Subsequently, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-2-mCMV-NGB vector was delivered into the subretinal space of the MNU-administered mice. The retinal NGB expression of the treated eye was upregulated significantly in both protein and mRNA levels. Further, we found NGB overexpression could alleviate visual impairments and morphological devastations in MNU-administered mice. NGB overexpression could rectify apoptotic abnormalities and ameliorate oxidative stress in MNU-administered mice, thereby promoting photoreceptor survival. The cone photoreceptors in MNU-administered mice were also sensitive to AAV-mediated NGB overexpression. Taken together, our findings suggest that manipulating NGB bioactivity via gene therapy may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against RD. Future elucidation of the exact role of NGB would advance our knowledge about the pathological mechanisms underlying RD.",

        "title": "Evaluation of Biomechanical Changes in Myopia Patients with Unsatisfactory Corneas After Femto Second-Laser In Situ Keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) Concurrent with Accelerated Corneal Collagen Cross-Linking Using Corvis-ST: Two-Year Follow-Up Results.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Some myopia patients with unsatisfactory corneas consider corneal refractive surgery for different reasons. Accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking (ACXL) is an effective method to enhance the resistance of the cornea. The present investigation was designed to evaluate the changes of biomechanical properties in patients with myopia and thin corneas after femtosecond-laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) concurrent with ACXL. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective study was designed. A total of 22 eyes of 11 myopia astigmatism patients with unsatisfactory corneas were enrolled. The patients were assigned to femtosecond-laser in situ keratomileusis concurrent with accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking (FS-LASIK-ACXL). The follow-up duration was 24 months. Manifest refraction, uncorrected (UDVA), and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), ultra-high-speed camera (Corvis-ST), corneal topography, anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT), Pentacam, and endothelial cell density (ECD) were examined before and after the operation. The corneal biomechanical and refractive data was analyzed using SAS9.3. Data were analyzed through normal distribution test and variance of analysis. The difference was considered as statistically significant when p<0.05. RESULTS The steep K (Ks) values, flat K (Kf) values, average keratometry values (Avek) values, and central corneal thickness (CCT) declined significantly after FS-LASIK-ACXL operation. The values of first applanation length (A1L), the second applanation length (A2L), the first applanation velocity (A1V), the second applanation velocity (A2V), deformation amplitude (DA), highest concavity peak distance (PD), and radius of curvature at the time of highest concavity (HCR) did not show significant difference after the operation. CONCLUSIONS FS-LASIK-ACXL is an effective and safe surgery for improving visual acuity for myopic patients with thin corneas, and it does not increase the risk of iatrogenic keratectasia.",

        "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group hereditary retinal disease that is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. The present study sought to explore the therapeutic effects of erythropoietin (EPO) on the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced photoreceptor degeneration. The MNU-administered mouse or normal control received a subretinal injection of EPO (at the dose of 10U). Twenty-four hours after EPO injection, the retinal EPO levels of experimental animals were quantified. Subsequently, the experimental animals were subjected to optokinetic tests, ERG examination, SD-OCT examination, histology assessment, and immunohistochemistry evaluation. The retinal superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and expression levels of several apoptotic factors were also quantified. The subretinal injection of EPO up-regulated the retinal EPO level in the retinas of MNU-administered mice. The optokinetic tests and ERG examination suggested the visual functional impairments in MNU-administered mice were ameliorated after EPO treatment. The SD-OCT and histological examination suggested the morphological devastations in MNU-administered mice were alleviated after EPO treatment. The cone photoreceptors in MNU-administered mice were protected from the MNU-induced detrimental effects. Moreover, the EPO treatment rectified the apoptotic abnormalities in MNU-administered mice, and enhanced the expression level of Foxo3, a critical mediator of autophagy. The EPO treatment also mitigated the MDA concentration and enhanced the retinal SOD activity, thereby counteracting the retinal oxidative stress in MNU administered mice. In ophthalmological practice, the subretinal delivery of EPO is a feasible therapeutic strategy to alleviate photoreceptor degeneration. These findings would enrich our pharmacological knowledge about EPO and shed light on the development of an effective therapy against RP.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence rate of temporal interictal epileptic discharges (TIEDs) in the epilepsy patients with extratemporal lesions (ETLs), and to determine the predictive factors for TIEDs in this cohort.Totally 221 patients were admitted for presurgical evaluation, and focal ETL were found in all of them by MRI examination. The occurrence rates of TIEDs in several groups with different brain lobe locations, durations; of epilepsy, seizure frequencies, and onset ages stages were assessed. We also evaluated the surgical outcome of; resection in this cohort.The total occurrence rate of TIEDs in this cohort was 29.9%. The occurrence rate of TIEDs in the patients with longer durations (>5 or 10 years) was significantly higher than those with shorter duration (<1 year). These; patients with lower seizure frequency (<1 seizure/month) had a significantly decreased incidence of TIEDs; compared with those with higher frequency (>1 seizure/month or week). In the terms of the brain lobe locations; and age at onset, there were no differences between the groups. Furthermore, there were no differences in terms of the surgical outcomes between the patients with TIEDs and other patients in this series.TIEDs were frequently recorded in these patients with ETLs, and the predictive factors for TIEDs included the epilepsy duration and seizure frequency.This study is instrumental for the presurgical EEG interpretationand thecounseling of these ETLs patients considered for epilepsy surgery.",

        "abstract": "The N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-treated rat is typically used as an animal model of chemically-induced retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been recognized as the crucial contributor to the retinal photoreceptor apoptosis seen in MNU-treated rats. In the present study, we explored the therapeutic effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS), a selective ROS scavenger, on MNU-induced photoreceptor degeneration. Intraperitoneal (IP)administration of HRS ameliorated MNU-induced photoreceptor degeneration in terms of morphology and function: Sharply decreased thickness of the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) and flattened photopic and scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) waveforms, typically seen in response to MNU treatment, were substantially rescued in rats cotreated with MNU and HRS (MNU + HRS). Moreover, the terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed a smaller number of apoptotic photoreceptors in the MNU + HRS group compared that in the MNU group. Compared to MNU-treated rats, retinal malondialdehyde (MDA) content in MNU + HRS rats significantly decreased while superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity significantly increased. Morphological and multi-electrode array (MEA) analyses revealed more efficient preservation of the architecture and field potential waveforms in particularly the peripheral regions of the retinas within the MNU + HRS group, compared to that in the MNU group. However, this enhanced protection of structure and function in the peripheral retina is unlikely the result of site-dependent variation in the efficacy of HRS; rather, it is most likely due to reduced susceptibility of peripheral photoreceptors to MNU-induced degeneration. Inner retinal neuron function in the MNU + HRS rats was better preserved, with fewer apoptotic photoreceptors in the ONL. Collectively, these results support the rationale for future clinical evaluation of HRS as a therapeutic agent for human RP.",

        "abstract": "To quantify the transcorneal electrical stimulation (TES)-induced effects on regional photoreceptors and visual signal pathway of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-treated retinas via topographic measurements.N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-administered mice received TES or sham stimulations and were subsequently subjected to electroretinography (ERG), multielectrode array (MEA), and histologic and immunohistochemistry examinations. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses were also performed to determine the mRNA levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Calpain-2, Caspase-3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).Amplitudes of ERG b-wave in the TES-treated mice were significantly larger than those in the sham controls (P < 0.01). Microelectrode array examination revealed that the photoreceptors in TES-treated retina were efficiently preserved (P < 0.01). Morphologic measurements showed that the central retina region was more consolidated than the other areas in the TES-treated mice. Together with the disproportionate distribution of immunostaining in retinal flat mounts, these findings indicated that different rescuing kinetics existed among regional photoreceptors. Compared with the sham controls, a significantly increased signal-to-noise ratio was also found in the TES-treated mice (TES100: 2.02 \u00b1 1.12; TES200: 4.42 \u00b1 1.51; sham: 0.25 \u00b1 0.13; P < 0.01). Moreover, qRT-PCR measurements suggested that the altered expression of several apoptotic factors and neurotrophic cytokines was correlated with TES-induced protection.Regional photoreceptors in the MNU-administered retinas exhibit different sensitivities to TES. Transcorneal electrical stimulation is capable of ameliorating MNU-induced photoreceptor degeneration and rectifying abnormalities in the inner visual signal pathways.",

Coordinated orchestration of multiple cellular processes including cytoskeletal dynamics and gene expression are essential for both developmental and regenerative axon growth. Recently, mounting evidence suggests that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a neuronal kinase implicated in almost all aspects of brain development and function, regulates multiple players required for axon formation and regeneration. Indeed, Cdk5 functions as a \"plastic\" kinase that maintains the axon growth ability by enabling efficient cytoskeletal reorganization, enhancing protein translation, reducing protein degradation, and promoting injury-induced gene transcription. Here, we summarize the up-to-date information on the mechanisms underlying the axon growth and regeneration after injury.",

        "abstract": "Dendrites are the primary sites on neurons for receiving and integrating inputs from their presynaptic partners. Defects in dendrite development perturb the formation of neural circuitry and impair information processing in the brain. Extracellular cues are important for shaping the dendritic morphogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we examined the role of ARMS (ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning protein), also known as Kidins220 (kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa), previously identified as a downstream target of neurotrophin and ephrin receptors, in dendrite development. We report here that knockdown of ARMS/Kidins220 by in utero electroporation impairs dendritic branching in mouse cerebral cortex, and silencing of ARMS/Kidins220 in primary rat hippocampal neurons results in a significant decrease in the length, number, and complexity of the dendritic arbors. Overexpression of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases, including TrkB and EphB2, in ARMS/Kidins220-deficient neurons can partially rescue the defective dendritic phenotype. More importantly, we show that PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase)- and Akt-mediated signaling pathway is crucial for ARMS/Kidins220-dependent dendrite development. Furthermore, loss of ARMS/Kidins220 significantly reduced the clustering of EphB2 receptor signaling complex in neurons. Our results collectively suggest that ARMS/Kidins220 is a key player in organizing the signaling complex to transduce the extracellular stimuli to cellular responses during dendrite development.",

        "abstract": "During cerebral cortex development, pyramidal neurons migrate through the intermediate zone and integrate into the cortical plate. These neurons undergo the multipolar-bipolar transition to initiate radial migration. While perturbation of this polarity acquisition leads to cortical malformations, how this process is initiated and regulated is largely unknown. Here we report that the specific upregulation of the Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, RapGEF2, in migrating neurons corresponds to the timing of this polarity transition. In utero electroporation and live-imaging studies reveal that RapGEF2 acts on the multipolar-bipolar transition during neuronal migration via a Rap1/N-cadherin pathway. Importantly, activation of RapGEF2 is controlled via phosphorylation by a serine/threonine kinase Cdk5, whose activity is largely restricted to the radial migration zone. Thus, the specific expression and Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of RapGEF2 during multipolar-bipolar transition within the intermediate zone are essential for proper neuronal migration and wiring of the cerebral cortex.",

        "abstract": "Mobile phone location data is a newly emerging data source of great potential to support human mobility research. However, recent studies have indicated that many users can be easily re-identified based on their unique activity patterns. Privacy protection procedures will usually change the original data and cause a loss of data utility for analysis purposes. Therefore, the need for detailed data for activity analysis while avoiding potential privacy risks presents a challenge. The aim of this study is to reveal the re-identification risks from a Chinese city's mobile users and to examine the quantitative relationship between re-identification risk and data utility for an aggregated mobility analysis. The first step is to apply two reported attack models, the top N locations and the spatio-temporal points, to evaluate the re-identification risks in Shenzhen City, a metropolis in China. A spatial generalization approach to protecting privacy is then proposed and implemented, and spatially aggregated analysis is used to assess the loss of data utility after privacy protection. The results demonstrate that the re-identification risks in Shenzhen City are clearly different from those in regions reported in Western countries, which prove the spatial heterogeneity of re-identification risks in mobile phone location data. A uniform mathematical relationship has also been found between re-identification risk (x) and data (y) utility for both attack models: y = -axb+c, (a, b, c>0; 0<x<1), where the exponent b increases with the background knowledge of the attackers. The discovered mathematical relationship provides data publishers with useful guidance on choosing the right tradeoff between privacy and utility. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of re-identification risks and a privacy-utility tradeoff benchmark for improving privacy protection when sharing detailed trajectory data.",

The aim of our study was to determine whether the new Cys-C criteria for identification and prognosis of AKI were superior to the RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO criteria.In the retrospective and multicenter study, the incidence of AKI was identified by the four criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to compare the predictive ability for 28-day mortality, and logistic regression analysis was used for the calculation of odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals.In the 1036 patients enrolled, the incidences of AKI were 26.4, 34.1, 37.8, and 36.1 %, respectively, under the four criteria. Patients with AKI had higher mortality and longer length of stay than those without in all definitions. Concordance in AKI diagnosis between Cys-C and KDIGO criteria was 95.9 %, higher than AKIN and RIFLE criteria (p < 0.0001). The area under ROC curves was 0.7023 for Cys-C criteria, which was a significantly greater discrimination (p < 0.05).KDIGO criteria identified significantly more AKI and AKI patients had significantly higher 28-day mortality than patients without AKI. The Cys-C criteria were more predictive for short-term outcomes than other three criteria among critically ill patients.",

Field-effect control through a gate terminal endows ACET-FFET the ability to generate arbitrary symmetry breaking in the transverse vortex flow pattern, which makes it attractive for mixing microfluidic samples. A computational model is developed to study the feasibility of this new microfluidic device design for micromixing. The influence of various parameters on developing an efficient mixer is investigated, and an integrated layout of discrete electrode array is suggested for achieving high-throughput mixing. Our physical demonstration with field-effect electrothermal flow control using a simple electrode structure proves invaluable for designing active micromixers for modern micro total analytical system.

To avoid the deleterious effects of Joule heating and electric current on sample cells, a rectangular microchannel was designed with distantly separated regions for pumping and cell culture. Temperature variations were examined using a commercial thermocouple sensor to detect temperature values in both pumping and culture regions. To generate a sufficient ACET circulatory pumping rate, thirty pairs of asymmetrical electrodes were employed in the pumping region; generated ACET velocity was measured by fluorescent micro-particle image velocimetry. The benefits of our pumping chip were demonstrated by culturing human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) and human colon carcinoma cells (SW620) for 72 h with an energized voltage of 3 V and 10 MHz. Cells grew and proliferated well, implying our ACET circulatory pumping chip has great potential for cell culture and tissue engineering applications.",

        "abstract": "Continuous dielectrophoretic separation is recognized as a powerful technique for a large number of applications including early-stage cancer diagnosis, water quality analysis, and stem cell-based therapy. Generally, the prefocusing of a particle mixture into a stream is an essential process to ensure all particles are subjected to the same electric field geometry in the separation region. However, accomplishing this focusing process either requires hydrodynamic squeezing, which requires an encumbering peripheral system and a complicated operation to drive and control the fluid motion, or depends on dielectro-phoretic forces, which are highly sensitive to the dielectric characterization of particles. An alternative focusing technigue, induced charge electroosmosis (ICEO), has been demonstrated to be effective in focusing an incoming mixture into a parti-cle stream as well as non-selective regarding the particles of interest. Encouraged by these aspects, we propose a hybrid method for micro-particle separation based on a delicate combination of ICEO focusing and dielectrophoretic deflection. This method involves two steps: focusing the mixture into a thin particle stream via ICEO vortex flow and separating the particles of differing dielectic properties through dielectrophoresis. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method proposed, we designed and fabricated a microfluidic chip and separated a mixture consisting of yeast cells and silica particles with an efficiency exceeding 96%. This method has good potential for flexible integration into other microfluidic chips in future.",

The in-plane fluid microvortices for mixing were generated by six pairs of reconstructed novel ACET asymmetric electrodes. To enhance the mixing efficiency, the novel ACET electrodes with rotating angles of 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 were investigated. The asymmetric electrodes with a rotating angle of 60\u00b0 exhibited the highest mixing efficiency by both simulated and experimental results. The length of the mixing area is 7 mm, and the mixing efficiency is 89.12% (approximate complete mixing) at a voltage of 3 V and a frequency of 500 kHz. The applicability of our micromixer with electrodes rotating at 60\u00b0 was demonstrated by the drug (tamoxifen) test of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) for five days, which implies that our ACET in-plane microvortices micromixer has great potential for the application of drug induced rapid death of tumor cells and mixing of biomaterials in organs-on-a-chip systems. \u00a9 2016 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be used to measure surface properties at the nanoscale. However, interpretation of measurements from amplitude modulation AFM (AM-AFM) in liquid is not straightforward due to the interactions between the AFM tip, the surface being imaged and the water. In this work, amplitude-distance measurements and molecular dynamics simulations of AM-AFM were employed to study the effect of surface hydrophobicity on the amplitude of tip oscillation in water. The sample surfaces consisted of self-assembled monolayers where the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity was determined by the terminal group of the alkanethiols. Analysis showed that surface chemical composition influences the hydration structure near the interface which affects the forces experienced by the tip and in turn changes the amplitude profile. This observation could aid our understanding of AM-AFM measurements of interfacial phenomena on various surfaces in water.",

        "abstract": "The spatial arrangement of target and probe molecules on the biosensor is a key aspect of the biointerface structure that ultimately determines the properties of interfacial molecular recognition and the performance of the biosensor. However, the spatial patterns of single molecules on practical biosensors have been unknown, making it difficult to rationally engineer biosensors. Here we have used high resolution atomic force microscopy to map closely spaced individual probes as well as discrete hybridization events on a functioning electrochemical DNA sensor surface. We also applied spatial statistical methods to characterize the spatial patterns at the single molecule level. We observed the emergence of heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns of surface hybridization of hairpin probes. The clustering of target capture suggests that hybridization may be enhanced by proximity of probes and targets that are about 10 nm away. The unexpected enhancement was rationalized by the complex interplay between the nanoscale spatial organization of probe molecules, the conformational changes of the probe molecules, and target binding. Such molecular level knowledge may allow one to tailor the spatial patterns of the biosensor surfaces to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility.",

        "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) signaling through retinoic acid receptors (RARs), known for its multiple developmental functions, emerged more recently as an important regulator of adult brain physiology. How RAR-mediated regulation is achieved is poorly known, partly due to the paucity of information on critical target genes in the brain. Also, it is not clear how reduced RA signaling may contribute to pathophysiology of diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. We report the first genome-wide analysis of RAR transcriptional targets in the brain. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomic analysis of RAR\u03b2-null mutant mice, we identified genomic targets of RAR\u03b2 in the striatum. Characterization of RAR\u03b2 transcriptional targets in the mouse striatum points to mechanisms through which RAR may control brain functions and display neuroprotective activity. Namely, our data indicate with statistical significance (FDR 0.1) a strong contribution of RAR\u03b2 in controlling neurotransmission, energy metabolism, and transcription, with a particular involvement of G-protein coupled receptor (p\u2009=\u20095.0e), cAMP (p\u2009=\u20094.5e), and calcium signaling (p\u2009=\u20093.4e). Many identified RAR\u03b2 target genes related to these pathways have been implicated in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease (HD), raising the possibility that compromised RA signaling in the striatum may be a mechanistic link explaining the similar affective and cognitive symptoms in these diseases. The RAR\u03b2 transcriptional targets were particularly enriched for transcripts affected in HD. Using the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD, we show that partial sequestration of RAR\u03b2 in huntingtin protein aggregates may account for reduced RA signaling reported in HD.",

        "abstract": "The human general transcription factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In eukaryotic cells, TFIID is thought to nucleate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex formation on all protein coding gene promoters and thus, be crucial for Pol II transcription. In a child with intellectual disability, mild microcephaly, corpus callosum agenesis and poor growth we identified a homozygous splice-site mutation in TAF8 (NM_138572.2:c.781-1G>A). Our data indicate that the patient's mutation generates a frame shift and an unstable TAF8 mutant protein with an unrelated C-terminus. The mutant TAF8 protein could not be detected in extracts from the patient's fibroblasts, indicating a loss of TAF8 function and that the mutation is most likely causative. Moreover, our immunoprecipitation and proteomic analyses show that in patient cells only partial TAF complexes exist and that the formation of the canonical TFIID is impaired. In contrast, loss of TAF8 in mouse embryonic stem cells and blastocysts leads to cell death and to a global decrease in Pol II transcription. Astonishingly however, in human TAF8 patient cells we could not detect any cellular phenotype, significant changes in genome-wide Pol II occupancy and pre-mRNA transcription. Thus, the disorganization of the essential holo-TFIID complex did not affect global Pol II transcription in the patient's fibroblasts. Our observations further suggest that partial TAF complexes, and/or an altered TFIID containing a mutated TAF8, could support human development and thus, the absence of holo-TFIID is less deleterious for transcription than originally predicted.",

It has been demonstrated that mutant  males display a variable degree of infertility whereas they all upregulate MMERVK10C transposons in their germ line. In order to study the function of both paralogs in the mouse, we generated and studied  double knockout (DKO) mutant mice. Adult DKO males exhibited a fully penetrant phenotype, similar to the most severe phenotype observed in the single KO mice, with small testes and impaired spermatogenesis, defects in meiotic chromosome synapsis, persistence of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis, lack of post-meiotic germ cells and upregulation of MMERVK10C expression. The phenotypic similarities to mice with knockouts in the  family genes prompted us to check and then demonstrate, by immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown followed by mass spectrometry analyses, that TEX19 paralogs interact with PIWI proteins and the TEX19 VPTEL domain directly binds Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in adult testes. We therefore identified two new members of the postnatal piRNA pathway.",

Two important problems arise in WDM network planning: network design to minimize the operation cost and traffic grooming to maximize the usage of the high capacity channels. In practice, however, these two problems are usually simultaneously tackled, denoted as the network design problem with traffic grooming (NDG). In this paper, a mathematical formulation of the NDG problem is first presented. Then, this paper proposes a new metaheuristic algorithm based on two-level iterated local search (TL-ILS) to solve the NDG problem, where a novel tree search based neighborhood construction and a fast evaluation method are proposed, which not only enhance the algorithm's search efficiency but also provide a new perspective in designing neighborhoods for problems with graph structures. Our algorithm is tested on a set of benchmarks generated according to real application scenarios. We also propose a strengthening formulation of the original problem and a method to obtain the lower bound of the NDG problem. Computational results in comparison with the commercial software CPLEX and the lower bounds show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the traffic grooming and routing problem with simple path constraint (denoted as GR) in WDM mesh networks. To the best of our knowledge, the simple path constraint has not been studied in previous literature. However, this non-trivial constraint is essential in practice and it makes the traffic grooming and routing problem become much more challenging due to the introduction of quadratic constraints. By giving the mathematical formulation of the GR problem, we propose a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) for solving the GR problem, and introduce a mechanism to tackle the interaction between the grooming problem and the routing problem. To test the performance of the proposed GRASP algorithm, we apply it to tackle three sets of totally 38 instances generated according to real-world scenarios. Computational results show the efficacy of the GRASP algorithm in terms of both solution quality and search efficiency by comparison with public software LocalSolver and the lower bounds obtained by CPLEX.",

        "abstract": "As the topic of the Google ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2012, machine reassignment problem (denoted as MRP) is an important optimization problem in load balance of cloud computing. Given a set of machines and a set of processes running on machines, the MRP aims at finding a best process-machine reassignment to improve the usage of machines while satisfying various hard constraints. In this paper, we present a metaheuristic algorithm based on multi-neighborhood local search (denoted as MNLS) for solving the MRP. Our MNLS algorithm consists of three primary and one auxiliary neighborhood structures, an efficient neighborhood partition search mechanism with respect to the three primary neighborhoods and a dynamic perturbation operator. Computational results tested on 30 benchmark instances of the ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2012 and comparisons with the results in the challenge and the literature demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MNLS algorithm in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, several key components of our MNLS algorithm are analyzed to gain an insight into it. HighlightsWe study the machine reassignment problem (MRP), the topic of the Google ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2012.We propose a multi-neighborhood local search (denoted as MNLS) for solving the MRP.MNLS consists of three primary and one auxiliary neighborhood structures.MNLS employs an efficient neighborhood partition search mechanism with respect to the three primary neighborhoods.MNLS performs favorably in comparison with the current best results in both the challenge and the literature.",

        "abstract": "Traditional five-axis tool path planning methods mostly focus on differential geometric characteristics between the cutter and the workpiece surface to increase the material removal rate(i.e.,by minimizing path length,improving curvature matching,maximizing local cutting width,etc.) . However,material removal rate is not only related to geometric conditions such as the local cutting width,but also constrained by feeding speed as well as the motion capacity of the five-axis machine. This research integrates machine tool kinematics and cutter-workpiece contact kinematics to present a general kinematical model for five-axis machining process. Major steps of the proposed method include:(1) to establish the forward kinematical relationship between the motion of the machine tool axes and the cutter contact point;(2) to establish a tool path optimization model for high material removal rate based on both differential geometrical property and the contact kinematics between the cutter and workpiece;(3) to convert cutter orientation and cutting direction optimization problem into a concave quadratic planning(QP) model. Tool path will finally be generated from the underlying optimal cutting direction field. Through solving the time-optimal trajectory generation problem and machining experiment,we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The striking predilection of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in women, especially during gonad-intact puberty or reproductive years, indicates that oestrogen plays an important role in the progression of TMD, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) was used to create temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) models in rats, while 17\u03b2-estradiol (E) injections were applied to mimic patients with high-physiological levels of oestrogen. Micro-CT scanning, histological staining and real-time PCR assays were preformed to observe the degenerative changes in the mandibular condylar cartilage and subchondral bone. The results showed that obvious degradation was found in the condylar cartilage and subchondral bone of rats with UAC procedure, including decreased cartilage thickness, loss of extracellular matrix, increased apoptotic chondrocytes and expression of pro-inflammatory and catabolic factors, decreased bone mineral density and increased osteoclast activity. E supplements aggravated the condylar cartilage degradation but reversed the abnormal bone resorption in the subchondral bone induced by UAC. Our results revealed that high-physiological oestrogen plays a destructive role in condylar cartilage but a protective role in subchondral bone at the early stage of TMJ OA. These dual and distinct effects should be given serious consideration in future OA treatments.",

        "abstract": "Traumatic joint injuries produce osteoarthritic cartilage manifesting accelerated chondrocyte terminal differentiation and matrix degradation via unknown cellular and molecular mechanisms. Here we report the ability of biomechanical stress to increase expression of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a pivotal driver of chondrocyte terminal differentiation, in cultured chondrogenic cells subjected to fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) and in chondrocytes of rodent temporomandibular joint (TMJ) cartilage subjected to unilateral anterior cross-bite (UAC). In cultured ATDC5 cells or TMJ chondrocytes, FFSS induced Ca -loading and CaSR localization in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), casually accelerating cell differentiation that could be abrogated by emptying ER Ca stores or CaSR knockdown. Likewise, acute chondrocyte-specific Casr knockout (KO) prevented the UAC-induced acceleration of chondrocyte terminal differentiation and matrix degradation in TMJ cartilage in mice. More importantly, local injections of CaSR antagonist, NPS2143, replicated the effects of Casr KO in preventing the development of osteoarthritic phenotypes in TMJ cartilage of the UAC-treated rats. Our study revealed a novel pathological action of CaSR in development of osteoarthritic cartilage due to aberrant mechanical stimuli and supports a therapeutic potential of calcilytics in preventing osteoarthritis in temporomandibular Joints by targeting the CaSR.",

        "abstract": "A switch from autophagy to apoptosis is implicated in chondrocytes during the osteoarthritis (OA) progression with currently unknown mechanism(s). In this study we utilized a flow fluid shear stress (FFSS) model in cultured chondrocytes and a unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) animal model. We found that both FFSS and UAC actively induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) chondrocytes, as demonstrated by dramatic increases in expression of HSPA5, p-EIF2AK3, p-ERN1 and ATF6. Interestingly, both FFSS and UAC activated not only pro-death p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS-apoptosis programs but also pro-survival p-ERN1-mediated autophagic flux in chondrocytes. Data from FFSS demonstrated that MTORC1, a downstream of p-ERN1, suppressed autophagy but promoted p-EIF2AK3 mediated ERS-apoptosis. Data from UAC model demonstrated that at early stage both the p-ERN1 and p-EIF2AK3 were activated and MTORC1 was inhibited in TMJ chondrocytes. At late stage, MTORC1-p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS apoptosis were predominant, while p-ERN1 and autophagic flux were inhibited. Inhibition of MTORC1 by TMJ local injection of rapamycin in rats or inducible ablation of MTORC1 expression selectively in chondrocytes in mice promoted chondrocyte autophagy and suppressed apoptosis, and reduced TMJ cartilage loss induced by UAC. In contrast, MTORC1 activation by TMJ local administration of MHY1485 or genetic deletion of Tsc1, an upstream MTORC1 suppressor, resulted in opposite effects. Collectively, our results establish that aberrant mechanical loading causes cartilage degeneration by activating, at least in part, the MTORC1 signaling which modulates the autophagy and apoptosis programs in TMJ chondrocytes. Thus, inhibition of MTORC1 provides a novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of OA.

        "abstract": "Fewer than 30% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are eligible to receive curative therapies, and so a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HCC is needed to identify potential therapeutic targets. The role of microRNA (miRNA) in modulating tumour progression has been demonstrated, and therapies targeting miRNA appear promising. miR-204-5p has been shown to function in numerous types of cancer, but its role in HCC remains unclear. In this study, we found that miR-204-5p expression was downregulated in cancerous HCC tissues compared to nontumour tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis also showed that low expression of miR-204-5p predicted worse outcomes of HCC patients. In addition, miR-204-5p expression was significantly lower in HCC cell lines. The function of miR-204-5p was also assessed both  and . We demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-204-5p in HCC cell lines inhibited HCC cell proliferation and clonogenicity using CCK8, BrdU and colony-forming assays, while the inhibition of miR-204-5p enhanced proliferation and clonogenicity. Further  studies in mice further confirmed the proliferation capacity of miR-204-5p. We also identified sine oculis homeobox homologue 1 () as a direct target of miR-204-5p and showed that it was inversely correlated with miR-204-5p in both human and mouse HCC tissues. Transfection of miR-204-5p mimics in BEL-7404 cells blocked the cell cycle by inhibiting the expression of cyclin-D1 and cyclin-A1, cell cycle-related factors regulated by SIX1. More importantly, overexpression of the 3'UTR mutant  but not the wild-type  abolished the suppressive effect of miR-204-5p, and downregulated SIX1 in BEL-7402 cells that transfected with miR-204 inhibitors could partly block the inhibitory effect of miR-204-5p on proliferation. Thus, we have demonstrated that miR-204-5p suppresses HCC proliferation by directly regulating SIX1 and its downstream factors.",

We sought to clarify the protective effect of HRS against the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) in C57BL/6 J model.The OIR in the HRS treated mice and the untreated controls were systematically compared. The retinas of both groups were analyzed using high-molecular-weight FITC-dextran staining of flat-mount preparations, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of cross-sections. The distribution and expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were also evaluated by the immunohistochemical measurements between postnatal days 17 (P17) and P21.The leakage and non-perfusion areas of retinal blood vessels were not alleviated in the HRS treatment group. Moreover, the number of preretinal vascular endothelial cell in the HRS treatment group was similar to that in the untreated group after exposure to hyperoxia (P>0.05). The degree of OIR was positively correlated with the expression level of VEGF. Intriguingly, the preretinal vascular endothelial cell count in the retinas of pups reared in room air with HRS treatment was 15.21\u00b12.98. The preretinal vascular endothelial cell count of the HRS treated mice was significantly higher than that of the untreated group reared in room air.In summary, HRS therapy (at the dose of 10ml/day, applied between P12 and P17) did not inhibit retinal neovascularization in OIR; On the contrary, it would induce the retinal neovascularization during the development of normal retinas.",

Here, we report the design and synthesis of hydrophobic aluminosilicate ZSM-5 zeolites by an organosilane-modification approach (ZSM-5-OS). Water-droplet contact angle tests confirm the formation of hydrophobic surface after the modification. Interestingly, the obtained ZSM-5-OS catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic properties in dehydration of various alcohols into the corresponding olefins in water solvent. The approach reported in this work would be potentially important for developing more efficient catalysts for biomass conversion in the future.",

By using a hydrophilic Pd catalyst, the conversion of phenylboronic acid and biphenyl selectivity could reach as high as 99.0 and 83.0%, respectively, which are much higher than those in mono-phase solvent under the same conditions.

        "abstract": "Many accidents happen under shunting mode when the speed of a train is below 45 km/h. In this mode, train attendants observe the railway condition ahead using the traditional manual method and tell the observation results to the driver in order to avoid danger. To address this problem, an automatic object detection system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to detect objects ahead in shunting mode, which is called Feature Fusion Refine neural network (FR-Net). It consists of three connected modules, i.e., the depthwise-pointwise convolution, the coarse detection module, and the object detection module. Depth-wise-pointwise convolutions are used to improve the detection in real time. The coarse detection module coarsely refine the locations and sizes of prior anchors to provide better initialization for the subsequent module and also reduces search space for the classification, whereas the object detection module aims to regress accurate object locations and predict the class labels for the prior anchors. The experimental results on the railway traffic dataset show that FR-Net achieves 0.8953 mAP with 72.3 FPS performance on a machine with a GeForce GTX1080Ti with the input size of 320 &times; 320 pixels. The results imply that FR-Net takes a good tradeoff both on effectiveness and real time performance. The proposed method can meet the needs of practical application in shunting mode.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) continues to rise because of increasing rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Inherited polymorphisms in DNA repair pathways may influence the risk of SCCOP development and the prognosis of SCCOP. We sought to determine whether polymorphisms in microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites within 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of genes in DNA repair pathways modulate the risk of SCCOP recurrence. We evaluated the associations between nine such polymorphisms and SCCOP recurrence in 1008 patients with incident SCCOP using the log-rank test and multivariable Cox models. In an analysis of all the patients, patients with variant genotypes of BRCA1 rs12516 and RAD51 rs7180135 had better disease-free survival (log-rank, P = 0.0002 and P = 0.0003, respectively) and lower risk of SCCOP recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-0.8, and HR, 0.5, 95% CI, 0.3-0.9, respectively) than patients with common homozygous genotypes of the two polymorphisms after multivariable adjustment. Moreover, in tumor HPV16-positive patients, patients with variant genotypes of the same two polymorphisms also had better disease-free survival (log-rank, P = 0.004 and P = 0.003, respectively) and lower recurrence risk (HR, 0.2, 95% CI, 0.1-0.6, and HR, 0.2, 95% CI, 0.0-0.7, respectively) than patients with common homozygous genotypes of the two polymorphisms. No such significant associations were found for other polymorphisms. These findings support significant roles of BRCA1 rs12516 and RAD51 rs7180135 in modifying the risk of recurrence of SCCOP, particularly HPV16-positive SCCOP. However, these results must be validated in larger studies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Given the crucial role of Mouse double minute 4 (MDM4) oncoprotein in p53 pathway, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could serve as such biomarkers for prediction of SCCOP recurrence. Thus, we investigated associations between three tagging putatively functional variants of MDM4, two in the 3' untranslated region of 3' UTR [rs11801299 (NC_000001.10:g.204529084G>A) and rs10900598(NC_000001.10:g.204525568G>T)] and one in intron 1 [rs1380576(NC_000001.10:g.204488278G>C)], and recurrence risk of SCCOP in 1,008 incident patients. A log-rank test and multivariable Cox models were used to assess associations. Patients with MDM4-rs10900598 GT/TT had a worse disease-free survival (DFS) compared with corresponding GG genotype, while those with rs11801299 AG/AA genotypes had a lower recurrence risk than the cases with rs11801299 GG genotype (both log-rank, P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that significantly different recurrence risk were found among patients with MDM4-rs10900598 GT/TT and rs11801299 AG/AA variant genotypes (HR, 2.0, 95% CI, 1.4-2.9 and HR, 0.4, 95% CI, 0.3-0.6, respectively) compared with their corresponding common homozygous genotypes. Furthermore, after combining the risk genotypes of the three SNPs, patients among low-risk group had a significantly lower risk of SCCOP recurrence than those in high-risk group (HR, 0.2, 95% CI, 0.1-0.3). The risk for both individual SNPs or combined risk genotypes was restricted to HPV-positive SCCOP patients. Our findings suggest that the MDM4 polymorphisms may, individually or in combination, confer an independent risk of SCCOP recurrence, particularly in HPV-positive SCCOP patients. However, larger studies are needed to validate our findings. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

We used the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test and Cox regression hazard ratios to analyze survival.Comparative proteomic and transcriptomic assays revealed that matched LTs and ANMMTs from the 3 patients had significantly different IL-12R\u03b22 and IFN-\u03b3 expression; the ratio of IL-12R\u03b22(+) TILs decreased with lower degrees of tumor differentiation. Among all 61 LC patients, the IL-12R\u03b22(+) TIL ratio in ANMMTs (38.5%\u202f\u00b1\u202f22.8%) was significantly higher than that in LTs (29.7%\u202f\u00b1\u202f19%; p<.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with an IL-12R\u03b22(+) TIL ratio \u226535% had significantly better survival than those with an IL-12R\u03b22(+) TIL ratio <35% (log rank p=0.041). Multivariable analysis showed a significant association between a high IL-12R\u03b22(+) TIL ratio and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.77).Tumor cell differentiation is associated with TILs' expression of IL-12R\u03b22, and an IL-12R\u03b22(+) TIL ratio \u226535%) indicates favorable prognosis in LC.",

        "abstract": "The increasing incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) is majorly attributed to the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Both HPV and MDM4 play a critical role in inhibition of p53 activity, thus affecting HPV tumor status of SCCOP. Three polymorphisms in MDM4 were genotyped from blood genomic DNA samples and HPV16 status in tumor specimens was examined. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were calculated for the associations between these polymorphisms and HPV16 status. Three MDM4 variant genotypes were significantly associated with HPV16 tumor status among SCCOP patients compared with the common homozygous genotypes (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-1.0 for rs10900598; OR, 1.6, 95% CI; 1.1-2.4 for rs1380576; and OR, 1.8, 95% CI, 1.1-2.9 for rs11801299; respectively). When we combined all risk genotypes of the 3 polymorphisms, the patients carrying 1-3 MDM4 risk genotypes were approximately 2.5 time as likely to have an HPV16-positive tumor than those with no risk genotypes (OR, 2.5, 95% CI, 1.6-3.9). Additionally, modifying effect of MDM4 risk genotypes was more pronounced among non-Hispanic white, never-smokers, and never-drinkers. Potential functional polymorphisms in MDM4 may serve as biomarkers for predicting tumor HPV16 status among SCCOP patients, particularly in non-Hispanic white, never-smokers and never-drinkers.

This paper proposes an efficient access control scheme based on CP-ABE with supporting attribute change in cloud storage system. The fine-grained access control can be achieved by re-encryption mechanism which takes the minimum shared re-encryption key for policy attribute set. And then the access structure tree is expanded by creating a corresponding virtual attribute for each leaf node attribute. The analysis results of the scheme indicate that the efficient and flexibility of the attribute change is not only improved, but also the system cost is reduced.",

        "abstract": "Berberrubine is an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Berberis vulgaris L, and it is readily derived from berberine. In this study, a sensitive and selective ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of berberrubine in rat plasma and mouse tissue has been developed. Magnoflorine was employed as an internal standard (IS), and liquid-liquid extraction by ethyl acetate was used for sample preparation. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1mm\u00d7100mm, 1.7\u03bcm) with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase with gradient elution. An electrospray ionization source was applied and operated in positive ion mode; multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode was used for quantification using target fragment ions m/z 322.0\u2192307.0 for berberrubine and m/z 342.8\u2192298.2 for IS. Calibration plots were linear in the range of 2-2000ng/mL for berberrubine in rat plasma and mouse tissue. Mean recoveries of berberrubine in rat plasma ranged from 79.6% to 84.8%. Intra-day and inter-day precision were less than 11%. The accuracy ranged from 93.6% to 106.8%. The method has also been successfully applied in pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution study of berberrubine. The absolute bioavailability of berberrubine was determined to be 31.6%. The results also show that berberrubine is rapidly absorbed and widely distributed in various tissues. The level of berberrubine in liver is highest, and followed by kidney, spleen and heart. Furthermore, the concentration of berberrubine in various tissues could also be predicted by a BP-ANN model.",

To explore the roles of the SDHA gene in Phytophthora sojae, we first cloned PsSDHA to construct the PsSDHA silenced expression vector pHAM34-PsSDHA, and then utilized PEG to mediate the P.\u00a0sojae protoplast transformation experiment. Through transformation screening, we obtained the silenced mutants A1 and A3, which have significant suppressive effect. Further study showed that the hyphae of the silenced mutant strains were shorter and more bifurcated; the growth of the silenced mutants was clearly inhibited in 10% V8 agar medium containing sodium chloride (NaCl), hydrogen peroxide (HO) or Congo Red, respectively. The pathogenicity of the silenced mutants was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type strain and the mock.

Many proteins participate in the process of pathogenetic, like the existence of a set of preset perfect procedures that command these proteins to perform their duties at the appropriate time and space, such as necrosis-inducing proteins. In this study, we investigated the function of the  PsSDHB  gene by constructing the  PsSDHB -silencing vector (pTOR- PsSDHB ) and transforming this vector into  P.\u00a0sojae  protoplasts using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated protoplast transformation. After the transformation, two silenced mutants (B1 and B2) with good inhibitory effects were obtained from the screening. Further experiments indicated that both of the silenced mutants showed slower mycelial growth. The growth of  P.\u00a0sojae  in medium containing NaCl, H 2 O 2 , and Congo Red (sodium salt of 3,3\u2032-bis) showed that silenced mutants had a lower resistance than the wild-type (WT) strain to stress conditions. Moreover, pathogenicity assays showed that both of the silenced mutants showed significantly reduced pathogenicity compared with the WT strain. Our experimental results may help improve our understanding of the energy supply chain of  P.\u00a0sojae  and provide a theoretical basis for the prevention of disease.",

However, the loose contact at the junction of the AgNWs and residual surfactant polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) increase the sheet resistance of the AgNWs. In this paper, an argon (Ar) plasma treatment method is applied to pristine AgNWs to remove the PVP layer and enhance the contact between AgNWs. By adjusting the processing time, we obtained AgNWs with a sheet resistance of 7.2\u03a9/\u25a1 and a transmittance of 78% at 550\u2009nm. To reduce the surface roughness of the AgNWs, a peel-off process was used to transfer the AgNWs to a flexible NOA63 substrate. Then, an OLED was fabricated with the plasma-treated AgNWs electrode as anode. The highest brightness (27000\u2009cd/m2) and current efficiency (11.8\u2009cd/A) was achieved with a 30\u2009nm thick light emitting layer of tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum doped with 1% 10-(2-benzothiazolyl)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7-tetramethyl-1H,5\u2009H,11H-(1)-benzopyropyrano(6,7-8-I,j)quinolizin-11-one. Compared to thermal annealing, the plasma-treated AgNW film has a lower sheet resistance, a shorter processing time, and a better hole-injection. Our results indicate that plasma treatment is an effective and efficient method to enhance the conductivity of AgNW films, and the plasma-treated AgNW electrode is suitable to manufacture flexible organic optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Networks of silver nanowires (AgNW) have been shown to facilitate high transparency, high conductivity, and good mechanical stability. However\uff0cthe loose characteristic and local insulation problems due to gaps between the nanowires limit their application as electrodes. This study investigates an inkjet-printed Ag grid combined with AgNW to form a transparent hybrid electrode. The printed Ag grid on AgNW film connects the gaps between the Ag nanowires to increase the overall electric conductivity. The printed Ag-grid/AgNW hybrid electrodes have low resistivity (22.5\u00a0\u03a9/\u25a1) while maintaining a high transmittance (87.5%). These values are similar to standard indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass which has resistivity of 20\u03a9/\u25a1 and transmittance of 89% at 550\u00a0nm. In addition, these hybrid electrodes are also very flexible when fabricated on a photopolymer substrate. A spin-coating process combined with a peel-off process enable the fabrication of flexible ultra-smooth Ag-grid/AgNW electrodes. We tested the transparent and flexible electrode as the anode of a flexible organic light emitting diode (F-OLED). The light emitting layer of the F-OLED is 35\u00a0nm thick tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum doped with 0.5% 10-(2-benzothiazolyl)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7-tetramethyl-1H,5H,11H-(1)-benzopyropyrano(6,7-8-I,j)quinolizin-11-one. The maximum brightness and current efficiency of the F-OLED are 10000\u00a0cd/m 2  and 12\u00a0cd/A, respectively, even when bent around a radius of 2\u00a0mm. The good performance of the device with Ag-grid/AgNW hybrid electrodes show that enhanced conductive inkjet-printed Ag nanoparticles combined with Ag nanowires can produce high quality electrodes for flexible organic optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "The portfolio optimization problem is the central problem of modern economics and decision theory; there is the Mean-Variance Model and Stochastic Dominance Model for solving this problem. In this paper, based on the second order stochastic dominance constraints, we propose the improved biogeography-based optimization algorithm to optimize the portfolio, which we called    e   BBO. In order to test the computing power of    e   BBO, we carry out two numerical experiments in several kinds of constraints. In experiment 1, comparing the Stochastic Approximation (SA) method with the Level Function (LF) algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (GA), we get a similar optimal solution by    e   BBO in     [ 0 , 0 . 6 ]     and     [ 0 , 1 ]     constraints with the return of 1.174% and 1.178%. In     [ - 1 , 2 ]     constraint, we get the optimal return of 1.3043% by    e   BBO, while the return of SA and LF is 1.23% and 1.26%. In experiment 2, we get the optimal return of 0.1325% and 0.3197% by    e   BBO in     [ 0 , 0 . 1 ]     and     [ - 0 . 05 , 0 . 15 ]     constraints. As a comparison, the return of FTSE100 Index portfolio is 0.0937%. The results prove that    e   BBO algorithm has great potential in the field of financial decision-making, it also shows that    e   BBO algorithm has a better performance in optimization problem.",

        "abstract": "In the field of investment, how to construct a suitable portfolio based on historical data is still an important issue. The second-order stochastic dominant constraint is a branch of the stochastic dominant constraint theory. However, only considering the second-order stochastic dominant constraints does not conform to the investment environment under realistic conditions. Therefore, we added a series of constraints into basic portfolio optimization model, which reflect the realistic investment environment, such as skewness and kurtosis. In addition, we consider two kinds of risk measures: conditional value at risk and value at risk. Most important of all, in this paper, we introduce Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm into portfolio optimization model, which simulates the gray wolf\u2019s social hierarchy and predatory behavior. In the numerical experiments, we compare the GWO algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The experimental results show that GWO algorithm not only shows better optimization ability and optimization efficiency, but also the portfolio optimized by GWO algorithm has a better performance than FTSE100 index, which prove that GWO algorithm has a great potential in portfolio optimization.",

        "abstract": "The mudded weak interlayer is a geotechnical sandwich material exhibiting strain softening behavior, which plays an important part in the slope stability. The present work primarily focuses on the shear strength of the mudded weak interlayer in rock slopes. To determine the peak and residual shear strengths of the mudded weak interlayers, the particle flow code (PFC) is used to simulate the failure behavior during the direct shear tests. Laboratory investigations including uniaxial compression test, SEM, and 3D deformation measurement are employed to calibrate the essential micro parameters of the mudded weak interlayer during the simulation process in PFC. The numerical model is built based on these parameters and both the peak and residual shear strengths can be predicted from the model. The prediction results show that the peak and residual internal friction angle are 19.36\u00b0 and 14.61\u00b0, while the peak and residual cohesion are 22.33\u2009kPa and 2.73\u2009kPa, respectively. Moreover, to validate the obtained peak and residual strengths, the results are compared with literature data. The peak and residual shear strengths of the mudded weak interlayer can serve as an important benchmark to evaluate the stability of side slopes and provide guiding suggestions for their reinforcement.",

        "abstract": "Weak muddy intercalations (WMI) are a type of geo-material with highly unstable mechanical properties, and thus they pose a great threat to the stability of rock slopes and in other rock engineering situations. In this paper, microstructure similarity-based clustering together with image fusion and reconstruction are used to study the microstructures of shallow weathered WMI. The study aims to obtain a reconstructed image of microstructure features that can represent a region to provide the basis for subsequent studies on WMI mechanical properties. The similarity of each microscopic WMI image is calculated using a similarity calculation model based on the microstructure parameters, and images are clustered based on their similarities. Then, image fusion technology is used to combine images in the same cluster. The results are as follows: (1) Similarity corresponding to a cumulative distribution probability of 80% is used as the clustering threshold; (2) The fused WMI microstructure image can represent the microstructure of a layer in the sample. In view of these findings, WMI microstructure clustering and feature reconstruction can provide evidence for studies on WMI lamina structures and failures involving these, which formed the basis for the assessment of the stability of slopes and other situations in which WMI are present.",

        "abstract": "Interactions between anionic polyelectrolyte, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and cationic surfactant, alkyltrimethylammonium bromide (Cn TAB), were investigated by rheological measurements in semidilute PAA solution. The dependences of the rheological behavior on the chain length of the surfactant, PAA neutralization degree, and temperature were discussed. The results revealed that both dodecyl and cetyltrimethylammonium bromides (C12TAB and C16 TAB) could increase the viscosity of PAA solution when the surfactant amounts surpassed a critical surfactant concentration (Cc), and Cc of C16TAB was lower than that of C12TAB at same PAA neutralization degree. The increase of viscosity is attributed to the surfactant micelles bridging of the polymer chains and confine the mobility PAA chain. On the other hand, it is found that the hydrogen bonding also played an important role in the PAA - CnTAB system, especially in lower neutralization degree PAA solution, which results in the viscosity increase rapidly with the added surfactant into lower neutralization degree PAA solution. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2009.",

It was found that the electrostatic shielding effect rather than the acid-base interaction was the major reason for the salt-in effect. The salt expansion effect, monitored by intrinsic viscosity under given ionic strengths (I), exhibited an efficiency sequence of cations differing from the salt-in effect. Both single molecule and intermolecular aggregation were found in even dilute solution. Expansion of single molecules and aggregates and breakdown and reformation of aggregates by hydrophobic interaction can be seen as I increases.

The concentration regions according to scaling theory were found the same as neutral polymers in good solvent. The specific viscosities could be normalized by the overlap parameter.

Mechanically, TIPE1 directly targets \u03b2-catenin and promotes \u03b2-catenin degradation in a protease-dependent manner, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays a crucial role during TIPE1-mediated stemness inhibition in colon cancer. These \ufb01ndings reveal that TIPE1 exerts anti-tumor effects in colon cancer and suggest that TIPE1 would be a therapeutic target for cancers.",

        "abstract": "The phospholipase C\u03b31 (PLC\u03b31) is essential for T-cell signaling and activation in hepatic cancer immune response, which has a regulatory Src homology 3 (SH3) domain that can specifically recognize and interact with the PXXP-containing decapeptide segment ( QPPVPPQRPM , termed as SLP76 peptide) of adaptor protein SLP76 following T-cell receptor ligation. The isolated peptide can only bind to the PLC\u03b31 SH3 domain with a moderate affinity due to lack of protein context support. Instead of the traditional natural residue mutagenesis that is limited by low structural diversity and shifted target specificity, we herein attempt to improve the peptide affinity by replacing the two key proline residues Pro187 and Pro190 of SLP76 PXXP motif with nonnatural N-substituted amino acids, as the proline is the only endogenous N-substituted amino acid. The replacement would increase peptide flexibility but can restore peptide activity by establishing additional interactions with the domain. Structural analysis reveals that the domain pocket can be divided into a large amphipathic region and a small negatively charged region; they accommodate hydrophobic, aromatic, polar, and moderate-sized N-substituted amino acid types. A systematic replacement combination profile between the peptide residues Pro187 and Pro190 is created by structural modeling, dynamics simulation, and energetics analysis, from which six improved and two reduced N-substituted peptides as well as native SLP76 peptide are identified and tested for their binding affinity to the recombinant protein of the human PLC\u03b31 SH3 domain using fluorescence-based assays. Two N-substituted peptides, SLP76 (N-Leu187/N-Gln190) and SLP76 (N-Thr187/N-Gln190), are designed to have high potency (K \u00a0=\u00a00.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 and 1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively), with affinity improvement by, respectively, 8.5-fold and 3.4-fold relative to native peptide (K \u00a0=\u00a05.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0\u03bcM).",

But, the underlying mechanism by which CEMIP contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC) remains undocumented. The association of CEMIP or miR-140-3p expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in CRC patients was analyzed by the tissue microarray and TCGA dataset. MiR-140-3p-specific binding with CEMIP was confirmed by luciferase report assay. In vitro experiments were conducted to assess the effects of CEMIP on the growth and invasion of CRC cells. Consequently, we found that CEMIP expression was dramatically elevated in CRC tissues and associated with a poor prognosis in CRC patients. The upregulation of CEMIP was attributable to the dysregulation of miR-140-3p rather than its genetic and epigenetic alterations. Ectopic expression of CEMIP facilitated the cell viability, colony formation, and invasive potential, but silencing of CEMIP revers...",

        "abstract": "Liver fibrosis due to hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation represents a common response to chronic liver injury. PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK) is a pan-VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of PTK/ZK in liver fibrosis. In primary HSCs, PTK/ZK inhibited the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), as well as cell proliferation, migration and actin filament formation. PTK/ZK-induced apoptosis of HSCs, which was correlated with increased caspase-3 activation and suppressed Bcl-2 expression. PTK/ZK also induced cell cycle arrest, accompanied by increasing the expression of p27Kip1 and downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E. PTK/ZK significantly inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, as well as VEGF-simulated cell proliferation and phosphorylation of Akt in activated HSCs. In a murine fibrotic liver, PTK/ZK attenuated collagen deposition and \u03b1-SMA expression in carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis in both a \u2018prevention\u2019 and \u2018treatment\u2019 dosing scheme. These beneficial effects were associated with reduced phosphorylation of Akt and suppressed mRNA expression of procollagen-(I), TIMP-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and CD31. These findings provide novel insights into the potential value of blocking VEGF signaling by a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor in treating hepatic fibrosis.",

We provide evidence that PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK), a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), significantly inhibits PDGF receptor expression, as well as PDGF-simulated HSC proliferation, migration and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt and p70S6 kinase. Interestingly, PTK/ZK also antagonizes the TGF-\u03b21-induced expression of VEGF and VEGFR1. Furthermore, PTK/ZK downregulates TGF-\u03b2 receptor expression, which is associated with reduced Akt, ERK and p38MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, PDGF-induced TGF-\u03b21 expression is inhibited by PTK/ZK. These findings provide evidence that PTK/ZK targets multiple essential pathways of stellate cell activation that provoke proliferation and fibrogenesis. Our study underscores the potential use of PTK/ZK as an antifibrotic drug in chronic liver disease.",

        "abstract": "The TEAD (1-4) transcription factors comprise the conserved TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain recognising the MCAT element in the promoters of muscle-specific genes. Despite extensive genetic analysis, the function of TEAD factors in muscle differentiation has proved elusive due to redundancy among the family members. Expression of the TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain that acts as a dominant negative repressor of TEAD factors in C2C12 myoblasts inhibits their differentiation, whereas selective shRNA knockdown of TEAD4 results in abnormal differentiation characterised by the formation of shortened myotubes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to array hybridisation shows that TEAD4 occupies 867 promoters including those of myogenic miRNAs. We show that TEAD factors directly induce Myogenin, CDKN1A and Caveolin 3 expression to promote myoblast differentiation. RNA-seq identifies a set of genes whose expression is strongly reduced upon TEAD4 knockdown among which are structural and regulatory proteins and those required for the unfolded protein response. In contrast, TEAD4 represses expression of the growth factor CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) to promote differentiation. Together these results show that TEAD factor activity is essential for normal C2C12 cell differentiation and suggest a role for TEAD4 in regulating expression of the unfolded protein response genes.",

        "abstract": "Malignant melanoma is an aggressive cancer known for its notorious resistance to most current therapies. The basic helix-loop-helix microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) is the master regulator determining the identity and properties of the melanocyte lineage, and is regarded as a lineage-specific 'oncogene' that has a critical role in the pathogenesis of melanoma. MITF promotes melanoma cell proliferation, whereas sustained supression of MITF expression leads to senescence. By combining chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing analyses, we show that MITF directly regulates a set of genes required for DNA replication, repair and mitosis. Our results reveal how loss of MITF regulates mitotic fidelity, and through defective replication and repair induces DNA damage, ultimately ending in cellular senescence. These findings reveal a lineage-specific control of DNA replication and mitosis by MITF, providing new avenues for therapeutic intervention in melanoma. The identification of MITF-binding sites and gene-regulatory networks establish a framework for understanding oncogenic basic helix-loop-helix factors such as N-myc or TFE3 in other cancers.",

        "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is the major clinical pathogen responsible for dental caries. Its acid tolerance has been identified as a significant virulence factor for its survival and cariogenicity in acidic conditions. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are recognized as key regulators of virulence and stress adaptation. Here, we constructed three libraries of sRNAs with small size exposed to acidic conditions for the first time, followed by verification using qRT-PCR. The levels of two sRNAs and target genes predicted to be bioinformatically related to acid tolerance were further evaluated under different acid stress conditions (pH 7.5, 6.5, 5.5, and 4.5) at three time points (0.5, 1, and 2 h). Meanwhile, bacterial growth characteristics and vitality were assessed. We obtained 1879 sRNAs with read counts of at least 100. One hundred and ten sRNAs were perfectly mapped to reported msRNAs in S. mutans. Ten out of 18 sRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. The survival of bacteria declined as the acid was increased from pH 7.5 to 4.5 at each time point. The bacteria can proliferate under each pH except pH 4.5 with time. The levels of sRNAs gradually decreased from pH 7.5 to 5.5, and slightly increased in pH 4.5; however, the expression levels of target mRNAs were up-regulated in acidic conditions than in pH 7.5. These results indicate that some sRNAs are specially induced at acid stress conditions, involving acid adaptation, and provide a new insight into exploring the complex acid tolerance for S. mutans.",

        "abstract": "Genetic studies have shown that variations in enamel formation genes are associated with caries susceptibility. The aim of this study was to test in vitro whether variants in these genes are associated with dental enamel demineralization in a Streptococcus mutans biofilm model. DNA and enamel samples were obtained from 213 individuals. DNA was extracted from saliva, and 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed. The physical and chemical properties of sound enamel samples and the mineral loss and the lesion depth of the demineralized enamel samples under cariogenic challenge were analyzed. Microhardness, enamel chemicals, mineral loss and demineralization depth were compared between different genotypes at each single nucleotide polymorphism. The GG genotype of TUFT1 (rs17640579) and the GT genotype of MMP20 (rs1612069) exhibited increased microhardness (p = 0.044 and 0.016, respectively). The GG genotype of AMBN (rs7694409) had a higher magnesium level, while the CT genotype of TFIP11 (rs2097470) had a lower magnesium level (p = 0.044 and 0.046, respectively). The GT genotype of MMP20 (rs1612069) had a higher calcium level (p = 0.034). The GG genotype of AMBN (rs13115627), the AG genotype of ENAM (rs12640848) and the AA genotype of MMP20 (rs2292730) had a lower phosphorus level (p = 0.012, 0.006, and 0.023, respectively). The GG genotype of AMBN (rs13115627) was also associated with a higher calcium-phosphorus ratio (p = 0.034). Individuals with the CC genotype of TFIP11 (rs134143) exhibited significantly more mineral loss (p = 0.011) and a deeper lesions (p = 0.042). Individuals with the TT genotype of TFIP11 (rs2097470) had more mineral loss (p = 0.018). Individuals with the GG genotype of TUFT1 (rs17640579) exhibited a shallower demineralization depth (p = 0.047). Individuals with the GT genotype of MMP20 (rs1612069) exhibited a shallower demineralization depth (p = 0.042). Individuals with the GG genotype of ENAM (rs12640848) exhibited less mineral loss (p = 0.01) and a shallower demineralization depth (p = 0.03). Genetic variations in TFIP11, TUFT1, MMP20, and ENAM influenced enamel demineralization in a Streptococcus mutans biofilm model.",

Two types of tips, corresponding to the upper and lower halves of a diamond nanowire, were fabricated by top-down plasma etching from a single-crystalline substrate. The lower, surface-attached halves can be directly integrated into lithographically-defined nanostructures, like cantilevers. The upper, detachable halves result in diamond nanowires with tunable diameter (50-500 nm) and lengths of a few microns. Tip radii were around 10 nm and tip apex angles around 15 degrees. We demonstrate the integration of diamond nanowires for use as scanning tips onto ultrasensitive pendulum-style silicon cantilevers. We find the non-contact friction and frequency jitter to be exceptionally low, with no degradation in the intrinsic mechanical quality factor (Q~130,000) down to tip-to-surface distances of about 10 nm. Our results are an encouraging step towards further improvement of the sensitivity and resolution of force-detected magnetic resonance imaging.",

We present exclusively gas-phase protocols to chemically passivate oxide-free Si(111) and Si(100) surfaces with short-chain alkynes. The resulting surfaces showed equal or better oxidation resistance than most existing liquid-phase-derived surfaces and rivaled the outstanding stability of a full-coverage Si(111)-propenyl surface. The most stable surface (Si(111)-ethenyl) grew one fifth of a monolayer of oxide (0.04 nm) after 1 month of air exposure. We monitored the regrowth of oxides on passivated Si(111) and Si(100) surfaces by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and observed a significant crystal-orientation dependence of initial rates when total oxide thickness was below approximately one monolayer (0.2 nm). This difference was correlated with the desorption kinetics of residual surface Si-F bonds formed during HF treatment. We discuss applications of the technology and suggest future directions for process optimization.",

We used the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method to solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and also numerically examine the effect of phonon boundary scattering. Surface transfer doping of the SiNWs by cobaltocene or decamethylcobaltocene drastically improves the electrical conductivity by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude, without affecting the thermal conductivity.

        "abstract": "Ferromagnetic nanowires are finding use as untethered sensors and actuators for probing micro- and nanoscale biophysical phenomena, such as for localized sensing and application of forces and torques on biological samples, for tissue heating through magnetic hyperthermia, and for microrheology. Quantifying the magnetic properties of individual isolated nanowires is crucial for such applications. Dynamic cantilever magnetometry is used to measure the magnetic properties of individual sub-500 nm diameter polycrystalline nanowires of Ni and Ni80 Co20 fabricated by template-assisted electrochemical deposition. The values are compared with bulk, ensemble measurements when the nanowires are still embedded within their growth matrix. It is found that single-particle and ensemble measurements of nanowires yield significantly different results that reflect inter-nanowire interactions and chemical modifications of the sample during the release process from the growth matrix. The results highlight the importance of performing single-particle characterization for objects that will be used as individual magnetic nanoactuators or nanosensors in biomedical applications.",
