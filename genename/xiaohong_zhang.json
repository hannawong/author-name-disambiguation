        "abstract": "Objective To establish the implanted animal model of human multidrug resistant cell line HL60/VCR in mice. Methods The concentration of Ishikawa cells in good condition were adjusted to 1. 0 \u00d7 107/0. 2ml were subcutaneously injected into BALB / c-nu / nu mice. Growing condition of tumor was observed,the specimens were taken for pathology examination and tumor marker in the body was monitored by PCR. Results A subcutaneous implanted tumor model of HL60 / VCR was established successfully in BALB / c-nu / nu mice. The formation ratio was 67. 7%. Immunohistochemistry showed tumor cells in liver and spleen,the expression of MDR1 gene was detected by PCR. Conclusion Subcutaneous transplantation can be used to establish an animal model of HL60 / VCR tumor cells in BALB / c-nu / nu mice successfully. This may be useful for study of behavior of multidrug resistance cell line in vivo and reversal of multidrug resistance.",

        "abstract": "To study the specific cellular immunoresponse of peripheral blood lymphocytes in the chronic hepatitis B patients treated with different doses of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine.Seventy-two chronic hepatitis B patients who did not use any anti-HBV drugs within 6 months were randomized into 3 groups (90 micrograms, 60 micrograms, and placebo) in a ratio of 1:1:1. The patients in different groups were treated with different doses of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in combination with IFN alpha 1b 50 micrograms with 3 times a week for 24 weeks. All patients were followed up for 24 weeks (W24). HBV DNA, HBeAg and liver functions were detected at different time points, and the number of cells that secrete IFN-gamma were detected by ELISPOT.There were no significant difference in ELISPOT positive ratio among the 3 groups on baseline detection. At W24, 12 cases, 12 cases, and 7 cases showed ELISPOT positive in the group of 90 micrograms, 60 micrograms, and placebo. The proportion of patients who were ELISPOT positive was higher in the groups treated with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (including the dose of 90 micrograms and 60 micrograms) than that in the placebo group (P=0.0446). HBV DNA turned negative in 6/24 of the patients treated with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (at both the doses of 90 micrograms and 60 micrograms), and HBeAg/Anti-HBe seroconversion or HBeAg became negative in 7/24 of them. In the placebo group, none of the patients showed undetectable HBV DNA, HBeAg/Anti-HBe seroconversion or HBeAg disappearance. At the 24W of follow up, in the patients who were ELISPOT positive, HBV DNA became undetectable in 4 of the patients treated with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (at doses of 90 micrograms and 60 micrograms), and HBeAg/Anti-HBe seroconversion or HBeAg disappearance were found in 9 of the cases. In the placebo group, none of the cases showed undetectable HBV DNA, and only 1 case had HBeAg/Anti-HBe seroconversion.The recombinant hepatitis B vaccine may increase the function of specific T lymphocytes in patients with chronic hepatitis B. There were no significant differences between the patients treated with the dose of 90 micrograms and 60 micrograms hepatitis B vaccine.",

Methods All of 137 chronic HBV infection subjects including 102 with chronic hepatitis B (CHB),25 with liver cirrhosis (LC) and 10 with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) were enrolled in this study. Histology features of 22 CHB patients have been desmonstrated by liver biopsy. PBMCs were isolated from fresh blood samples. HBV-specific T cells were expanded in vitro in 64 patients with HLA-A2 positive. Flow cytometry was used to detect the HLA-A2 type,the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on PBMCs and PD-1 on HBV specific CD8+ T cells. IFN-\u03b3 was assayed by ELISA. Results In groups of CHB,LC and ACLF,PD-1 expression on PBMCs were (55.4\u00b116.5)%,(54.3\u00b121.9)% and (45.5\u00b126.5)%,compared with control,P values were 0.000,0.001 and 0.071,respectively; PD-L1 were (41.7\u00b117.7)%,(33.4\u00b117.9)% and (26.6\u00b111.8)%,compared with control,P values were 0.006,0.252 and 0.854,respectively. Sixty four cases were HLA-A2 positive. The proportions of HBV-specific T cells were (1.6\u00b11.0)%,(3.1\u00b11.6)% and (3.3\u00b11.7)%,respectively. In CHB,LC and ACLF subjects of HLA-A2 positive,significant differences were found between LC and control,ACLF and control (P< 0.05); There were no significant differences in PD-1 expression on HBV-specific cells and IFN-\u03b3 levels in cell culture medium. PD-1 expressions on PBMCs were similar in CHB patients with different degrees of liver pathological changes,but PD-L1 expressions were higher in G1 and S0 patients than that in other patients. Conclusions PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions were up-regulated in patients with HBV chronic infection. The degree of liver damage may be correlated with HBV-specific cells and PD-L1 expression but not correlated with PD-1 expression.",

SPSS16. 0 was used to perform chi-square test and multiple logistic regression.136 cases of patients were infected with HCV virus mainly through blood and blood products transfusion. They were diagnosed mainly between 2000 and 2005. 98 cases of them had anti-viral treatment with interferon and ribavirin, while the rest did not; 12 new cases developed HCV-related cirrhosis or liver carcinoma in five years, which accounted for 8.8% of the total. Among 76 cases once treated with interferon, 46 cases (60.5%) relapsed in five years. For patients with age < 40, the rates of cirrhosis and liver cancer were 0, and patients with age \u2265 40 but < 60 years, the rates of cirrhosis and liver cancer were 12.5% (7/56 cases), while for those \u2265 60 years old the rates were 35.7% (10/28 cases). The difference was significant ( B = 0.111, Wald = 4.324, P = 0.038) as analysed by logistic regression. The rates of cirrhosis and liver cancer were zero for those with normal or within twice the upper normal AST limit in five years, 43.5% (10/23 cases) for those with AST ranging from 2 to 4 fold the upper normal limit, and 58.3% (7/12 cases) for those with AST higher than four times the upper normal limit. The difference was also significant ( B = 2.184, Wald = 5.443, P = 0.02) by logistic regression analysis. The rate of relapse was 29.7% (11/37 cases) for those using pegylated interferon and 89.7% (35/39 cases) for those using interferon. The difference was significant ( Result of logistic regression showed-B = -2.077, Wald = 4.352, P = 0.037). The rate of relapse was 100% (15/15 cases) for those with treatment less than 24 weeks, 76.2% (16/21 cases) for those with treatment more than 24 weeks but less than 48 weeks, and 37.5% (14/40 cases) for those with treatment more than 48 weeks. The difference was significant (Result of logistic regression showed-B = -1.632, Wald = 6.651, P = 0.01). 42 cases of the relapsed (91.3%) were administrated with interferon once again with ideal effect.Hepatitis C virus infection increases the risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Interferon combined with ribavirin therapy could effectively control the virus and improve outcomes. We can reduce the incidence of relapse by choosing the treatment of pegylated interferon instead of interferon and by completing the full treatment.",

        "abstract": "[Objective] To investigate the risk factors of liver failure due to lamivudine resistance in the patients with chronic hepatitis B. [Methods] Fifty-six cases with acute exacerbation in chronic hepatitis B patients due to lamivudine resistance were investigated. The age and the diagnosis of the disease before lamivudine therapy, the liver function, HBsAg, HBsAb,HBeAg,HBeAb,HBcAb, HBV DNA load, the rate of YMDD mutation and pre-C mutation were also recorded. All cases were divided into liver function failure group and chronic hepatitis B group when flared, and each factor in the 2 groups was compared. [Results] The patients in liver function failure group were elder in age (P < 0.05). The HBV DNA load detected when flared in liver function failure group were higher than those in chronic hepatitis B group [(2.8\u00d7108\u00b14.9\u00d7108) copies/mL vs (3.1\u00d7106\u00b12.9\u00d7106 ) conpies/mL,P < 0.05]. The rate of HBeAg seroconversion in liver function group (54.6%) was higher than the rate in chronic hepatitis B group (18.4%,P< 0.05). Analyzed with binary logistic regression, the age and the diagnosis as liver cirrhosis before lamivudine therapy were both the isolated risk factors of liver function failure due to lamivudine resistance.[Conclusions] Diagnosed as liver cirrhosis and aged before lamivudine therapy, high virus load when flared may be the risk factors of liver function failure due to lamivudine resistance in the patients with chronic hepatitis B. Early use of adefovir dipivoxil or entecavir should be considered in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis when they have resisted to lamivudine.",

        "abstract": "To study PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions during 24 weeks telbivudine antiviral treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and to explore the relationship between PD-1 expression and HBeAg/HBeAb seroconversion.Ten CHB cases with HLA-A2 and HBeAg positive were treated with telbivudine 600 mg/d orally for 24 weeks. Fresh blood samples were collected at week 0, 12 and 24 after treatment. HBV-specific CD8+ T cells were expanded in vitro. Cell culture medium were collected for interferon gamma (IFNgamma) detection. Flow cytometry was used to detect the HLA-A type, PD-1, PD-L1 and HBV specific CD8+ T cells. The expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1, the counts of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells in circulating CD8+ lymphocytes, and IFNgamma concentration in culture medium were evaluated during antiviral treatment.At week 0, 12 and 24 after telbivudine treatment, 7 of 10 patients were HBV DNA undetectable, 2 were HBeAg seroconversion and 2 were HBeAg lose but anti-HBe negative. The frequency of PD-1-positive PBMCs were 52.1%+/-17.0%, 39.1%+/-18.2% and 23.4%+/-16.3% (week 24 vs week 0, P < 0.01) respectively; PD-L1 positive PBMCs were 45.6%+/-15.4%, 34.6%+/-16.2% and 20.9%+/-9.5% respectively(week 24 vs week 0, P < 0.01; week 24 vs week 12, P < 0.05). The frequency of PD-1-positive CD8+ T cells were 76.2%+/-10.4%, 66.5%+/-15.4% and 49.5%+/-25.3% respectively (week 24 vs week 0, P < 0.01; week 12 vs week 0, P < 0.05; week 24 vs week 12, P < 0.05); HBV-specific CD8 cells were 1.3%+/-0.5%, 1.5%+/-1.0% and 2.2%+/-1.5%; IFNgamma levels in cell culture medium were (91.7+/-82.1) pg/ml, (99.4+/-93.5) pg/ml and (109.5+/-86.6) pg/ml. A remarkable decrease of PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions and increase of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells were observed in patients who had HBeAg/HBeAb seroconversion at week 24.Direct suppression of HBV replication by telbivudine in CHB patients can decrease PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions and restore HBV-specific CD8+T cells. The relationship between the changes of PD-1 expression and HBeAg/HBeAb seroconversion during antiviral therapy in HBeAg-positive patients need to confirm by future study.",

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon-\u03b12a (PEG-IFN-\u03b12a) for such CHB patients.A total of 74 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with a spontaneous HBV DNA decline (by >2 log10 IU\u2022ml(-1), compared with baseline levels before antiviral treatment) after AE (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]: 10-30-fold the upper limit of normal [ULN], total bilirubin [TBIL]: 2-20 mg\u2022dl(-1), prothrombin time activity >60%) were included. In total, 22 patients (group A) received PEG-IFN-\u03b12a treatment (180 \u00b5g\u2022kg(-1)\u2022week(-1), when ALT was <10 ULN and TBIL<2 mg\u2022dl(-1)) for 48 weeks, with 48 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. Twenty-one patients (group B) selected continual entecavir therapy. Thirty-one patients (group C, control group) received routine liver-protective drugs.At week 96, virological response rates were 90.5%, 100% and 48%, and ALT normalization rates were 81%, 95% and 40% for groups A, B and C, respectively. HBeAg seroconversion rates were 71.4%, 45% and 32% in groups A, B and C, respectively. A high hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss rate was observed in PEG-IFN-\u03b12a-treated patients, while no entecavir-treated patients achieved HBsAg loss. Group A patients suffered from typical PEG-IFN therapy-related adverse events. No severe adverse event was observed in any groups.PEG-IFN-\u03b12a is effective and safe for treating CHB patients demonstrating a spontaneous decline in HBV DNA after AE, and yields an increased likelihood of HBsAg loss.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of HBV antigens and pathological mechanism of chronic HBV infection by analyzing the cellular immune function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HBsAg carriers.PBMCs were prepared from individuals with chronic asymptomatic HBV infection and cultured in the presence of different antigens and/ or cytokines. The levels of cytokines in culture supernatants were detected by ELISA method. The phenotype of the cells was detected by FACS.The levels of IFN y secreted by PBMCs from HBsAg carriers were (48.3+/-19.8) pg/ml, significantly lower than that from healthy controls (t = 3.023, P less than 0.05); The IFN y produced by PBMCs from HBeAg positive patients due to HBsAg and HBcAg stimulation were (50.4+/-51.6) pg/ml and (63.2+/-36.9) pg/ml, significantly lower than that of HBeAg negative patients (t = 2.468 and 3.184, P less than 0.05, respectively). The IL-12p70 secreted by PBMCs from HBeAg positive patients was also significantly lower than that of HBeAg negative patients (P less than 0.05); Exogenous IL-12 promoted significantly PBMCs to secrete IFN y (P less than 0.01) and IL-12 combined with HBV antigens activated CD8+CD45RA+CCR7+ and CD8+CD45RA-CD62L+ cells. IL-12 secreted by PBMCs decreased in HBeAg positive patients, which may be the crucial reason of viral persistence in chronic HBV carriers. Exogenous IL-12 combined with specific HBV antigen could promote the central memory CD8+ T cells to produce IFN y.",

All patients were genotyped for the rs8099917 polymorphism and correlations with antiviral efficacy were determined by statistical analysis.One-hundred-and-eighty-two (82.7%) of the patients achieved end-of-treatment virological response (ETVR). Significantly more patients in the ETVR group carried the rs8099917 genotypes of TT (93.5%) and GT+GG (68.8%), compared to the patients who did not achieve ETVR (X2=23.287, P less than 0.01). In addition, the patients who achieved SVR also represented significantly higher rates of both genotypes (TT: 86.2% and GT+GG: 60.6%; X2=15.531, P less than 0.01). In the SVR group: TT vs. GT+GG: odds ratio (OR)=4.063, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.972-8.369; X2=15.531, P less than 0.01.

        "title": "Prediction of response to pegylated-interferon- and ribavirin therapy in chinese patients infected with different hepatitis C virus genotype",
        "abstract": "Background: The standard treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), pegylated interferon-? (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) does not provide a sustained virological response (SVR) in all patients. Genetic variations at the interleukin 28B (IL-28B) locus are important in predicting outcome following therapy in CHC patients. Results: We investigated the role of IL28B variations (rs8099917) in response to PEG-IFN-?/RBV treatment and evaluated its association with the risk of the null virological response (NVR) and relapse (REL) in different viral genotypes. We found that the overall distributions of the genotype among the SVR, NVR, and REL groups were significantly different (P0.001). Patients with the TG genotype had an increased risk of NVR and REL (OR=6.45 95% CI =2.8814.47, P0.001 for NVR; OR=2.51, 95% CI =1.294.86, P=0.006 for REL, respectively), and patients with the GG genotype had a further increased risk of NVR and REL (OR=12.04, 95% CI =3.2145.13, P0.001 for NVR; , OR=4.30, 95% CI =1.2115.13, P=0.017 for REL, respectively). G variant genotypes (TG+GG) also had an increased risk of NVR and REL, and there was a significant trend for a dose-effect of G allele on the risk of NVR and REL (P0.05). The SVR rate in TT higher than in TG+GG was more pronounced in those patients infected with non-G1 compared to the patients infected with G1. The treatment response did differ based on the rs8099917 genotype in patients with different viral genotypes, compared with patients infected with the non-G1, the G1 infected patients had an increased risk of NVR and REL (OR=2.03 95% CI =1.034.01, P=0.04 for NVR and OR=2.58, 95% CI =1.354.94, P=0.004 for REL, respectively). Moreover, multivariate regression analysis show that the rs8099917 G allele was the only independent factor significantly associated with a NVR and REL. Conclusion: This study suggests that host genetic polymorphisms rs8099917 in the vicinity of IL-28B is the most important predictor of treatment response of PEG-IFN-?/RBV for HCV patients in China. \u00a9 2012 Guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

Two hours after the last injection the rats were sacrificed. The sera were collected and stored at -70 degrees C for subsequent hormone assay. The concentration of serum testosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay. Serum NOx- (nitrite/nitrate) concentration was measured by Greiss method. DNA of spermatogenic cells was detected by flow cytometry(FCM), and the percentage of 1c, 2c and 4c germ cells calculated.In the SNP treatment group, the serum concentration of NOx- was higher, testosterone concentration was lower and the number of 1c cells was smaller compared with the control group. However, in rats treated with L-NAME, the concentration of NOx- was significantly lower, testosterone concentration was higher and the number of 1c cells was larger compared with the control group(P < 0.01). No changes were observed in the SNP + L-NAME group.Enhancing ectogenous NO will suppress spermatogenesis while inhibiting NO productive pathway will promote it.",

        "abstract": "Non-secreted macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) plays an important role in genesis and progression of tumors. To explore the regulation of cytoplasmic M-CSF on the proliferation of HeLa cells, pCMV/myc/cyto-M-CSF vectors were transfected into HeLa cells. After comfirmed by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunocytochemistry, the effect of cytoplasmic M-CSF on the proliferation of HeLa cells were analyzed by MTT and antisense oligonucleotides. The doubling time was counted according to cell growth curves. The mRNA expression of cyclinE, cyclinD 1/2/3, CDK2/4/6 were assayed by RT-PCR. The results from RT-PCR, Western blot and immunocytochemistry showed that both M-CSF mRNA and protein were expressed at a higher level and localized to the cytoplasm in M-CSF-transfected HeLa cells, compared with either pCMV/myc/cyto-transfected HeLa cells or untransfected HeLa cells. M-CSF-transfected HeLa cells had shorter doubling time and more significantly augmented reproductive activity than either pCMV/myc/cyto-transfected HeLa cells or untransfected HeLa cells. M-CSF specific antisense oligonucleotides significantly inhibited the proliferation of the M-CSF-transfected cells, but had little effect on the other two groups. Furthermore, cytoplasmic M-CSF up-regulated the mRNA expression of cyclinD 1, cyclinD3, CDK2 and CDK6(P< 0.05). So it was concluded that cytoplasmic M-CSF accelerates the proliferation of HeLa cells by up-regulating the mRNA expression of cyclinD 1/D3 and CDK2/6.",

Methods Function part of M-CSF cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted to nucleus-localization expression vector pCMV/myc/nuc to construct pCMV/M-CSF. Then the pCMV/M-CSF was transfected into NIH3T3 cells and the cells clones were selected with G418. The expression and localization of M-CSF in NIH3T3 cells were verified by immunocytochemistry and Western blot. At last,the effect of nuclear M-CSF on cell movement was analyzed by cell scratch assay. Results The size of inserted fragments in the recombinant vectors pCMV/M-CSF is 1400bp, corresponding to that of M-CSF. After transfecting pCMV/M-CSF into NIN3T3 cells by liposome and screening using G418, pCMV/M-CSF-transfected NIN3T3 cells can stably express M-CSF protein in nucleus. The results from cell scratch assay show that pCMV/M-CSF-transfected NIN3T3 cells have stronger movement ability. Conclusions The nuclear localization vector pCMV/M-CSF was successfully constructed, M-CSF in nucleus promoted the NIH3T3 cells movement.",

Cell cycle was assayed by flow cytometry. The expression of phospho-p38, Cdc25B and Cdc2, and p38 mRNA were measured by Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively.After treatment with DADS at 5 - 160 micro mol/L for 0 - 72 h, the growth of HL-60 cells were suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner and the inhibitory effect of DADS (20 micro mol/L) was similar to that of ATRA (10 nmol/L) (P > 0.05). Incubation of HL-60 cells with DADS (20 micro mol/L) for 12 h could activate G(2)/M checkpoint and increase the expression of phospho-p38 MAPK, followed by the expression of phospho-Cdc25B and phospho-Cdc2 (P < 0.05). SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, markedly blocked the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, Cdc25B and Cdc2 (P < 0.05).DADS could induce the G(2)/M arrest in HL-60 cells which may be involved in the activation of p38 MAP kinase.",

Methods Bininformatical analysis on ZNF569 was made by utilizing Bininformatical Web and soft ware. Results Protein containing KRAB/C2H2 is an important transcriptional factor.Alignment between the cDNA sequence and human genome indicates that ZNF569 is identical on chromosome 19q13.12,spanning approximately 56.28 kb in reverse manner on the genome and organized into 6 exons ZNF569 encodes a putative protein of 686 amino acids.The predicted amino acid sequence of ZNF569 contains an N-terminal Kr\u00fcppel-associated box(KRAB) domain,and a series of 18 C2H2 zinc finger motifs that extend to the end of the protein sequence.A search of published DNA databases for sequences similar to that of ZNF569 demonstrated that they had varying degrees of similarity to a number of previously identified C2H2-type zinc-fingers protein. Sequence analysis and database comparison indicate that the predicted protein contains 18 different C2H2 zinc-finger domains in tandem arrays,characteristic of transcription factor proteins of this family. Conclusion A search of analyzed evolutionary relationship among different zinc-finger proteins with phylogenetic tree analysis show that ZNF569 is one of the conserved proteins during evolution.",

All the individuals and 373 demented elderly people completed a series of neuropsychological examination and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).Among the dementia participants, 49.33% had exhibited neuropsychiatric symptoms (35.66% rated as clinically significant), in which 80.4% reported 2 or more disturbances, with depression (23.86%), apathy (21.72%) and anxiety (20.38%) being most common. Of the 1540 normal individuals, 18.25% of them exhibited neuropsychiatric symptoms (6.49% rated as clinically significant), in which 53% reported 2 or more disturbances, with sleepless (10%), depression (8.9%) and anxiety (6.97%) being the most common.To our knowledge, this was the first multi-center study on neuropsychiatric disturbances in dementia and cognitive normal elderly people. Neuropsychiatric symptoms occurred mainly in persons with dementia and of clinical severity. Though the neuropsychiatric disturbances reported in cognitive normal individuals were lower and less serious compared to dementia, they should not be neglected. These finding suggested that a screening programme focusing on identifying these symptoms should be included in the physician's diagnostic tools for dementia.",

        "abstract": "To observe the effect of small dose donepezil (Aricept) on the cognition status and the changes of metabolites in brain tissue in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in order to find out the effective way to prevent and cure dementia.33 patients with aMCI were selected. There were 21 cases in a treatment group taking 2.5 mg of Aricept daily for 3 months and 12 cases in a control group taking basic internal medicines. Before and after taking the medicine, cognition tests such as clinical memory test, basic IQ test, language fluency test and drawing-clock test were carried out. Before and after treatment, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in hippocampus region was carried out in 5 patients of the treatment group.Compared with the results before treatment, the memory IQ test, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) total scores as well as delayed memory scores in the treatment group were improved significantly after treatment. The difference was statistically significant. MRS results indicated that after treatment NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr in hippocampus region did not change significantly and MI/Cr was increased.2.5 mg/d of Aricept can improve general cognition function in patients with aMCI as shown by memory IQ and delayed memory scores. The results of MRS indicate that no apparent change of NAA/Cr and increase of MI/Cr imply improvement of memory with Aricept through activating astrocytes, stabilizing neurons and regulating the signal transmission among synapses.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the incidence of hematological damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its relationship with disease state and immunological parameters of SLE.155 inpatients with SLE were enrolled in this retrospective study in our hospital. All patients fulfilled the criteria of SLE drawn up by American Rheumatism Association (ARA) in 1982. Fasting blood samples were obtained and blood routine, liver and renal function, immunological parameters were determined. According to SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), disease state was evaluated in 155 patients and their correlation parameters were analyzed, with hematological damage and immunological parameters analyzed.67.7% of the patients had hematological disorder. Single cell line damage was present in 32.9% of the patients, while 34.8% of the patients were involved in damage of several cell lines. The detectable rate of Anti-Sm (43.8%) and Anti-RNP (64.8%) in patients with hematological disorder were higher than those in patients without hematological disorder (Anti-Sm 26.0%, Anti-RNP 44.0%). The positive rate of Anti-RNP were 69.0% in patients with red cell line damage while only 44.0% in patients without hematological disorder (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Anti-RNP between patients without hematological disorder and patients with leukocytopenia or thrombocytopenia. Among the 155 patients 49 were in progressive stage and 106 in stationary stage. Hematological damage occurred approximately in 75.5% of the patients in progressive stage and in 64.2% of the patients in stationary stage. The prevalences of Anti-dsDNA, Anti-RNP, Anti-Sm and several cell lines damage were significantly higher in patients with progressive stage than in patients with stationary stage.Hematological system is easily damaged in patients with SLE and its involvement is related with the disease state. Anti-RNP could reflect red cell line damage.",

        "abstract": "Objective Some researches showed that vascular risk factors might be related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there are still disputes among neurologists. Therefore, it was our hope to explore the possible relationship between AD and vascular factors. Methods A case-control study including 155 cognitive normal controls and 91 possible AD patients in Chinese PLA General Hospital was conducted. The patients and controls were matched for gender, occupation and education level. The relationship between AD and vascular factors was analyzed by Logistic model. The level of statistical significance of differences in single factor and multivariate analysis was P<0.05. Results Single factor analysis showed that 12 factors were found to be correlated with AD, namely pacemaker's cardiac rhythm, anaemia, coronary heart diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, stroke, arrhythmia, transient ischemic attack, heart block, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, marriage status and ages. The OR values were 12.83, 6.76, 5.16, 4.87, 3.80, 3.30, 2.88, 2.81, 2.05, 1.91, 1.18 and 1.57, respectively (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed that after controlling the influence of ages and marriage status, the history of anaemia, coronary heart diseases and stroke were related to AD. The OR values (95% confidence interval, 95%CI) were 4.87 (2.12-11.22), 2.94 (1.38-6.27) and 2.44 (1.28-4.64) in turn. Conclusion AD is associated to vascular factors, and the history of anaemia, coronary heart diseases and stroke may be the independent risk factors of AD. The prevention and treatment of vascular diseases may improve the cognitive status of elder people.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To survey the prevalence rate of disturbance in sleep and related risk factors in persons of community and light and moderate dementia patients. Methods: The investigation was conducted between January 2002 and January 2003. The random community non-demented sample of 3 108 adults aged 40 year-old and above were residents living within Beijing 8 urban areas and rural area, such as Beijing Wanshoulu Area and Tongzhou Countryside, etc. All the participants had no cognitive impairment complaints and with a Mini-Mental State Examination score above or equal 26 points. The sleep problem was also analyzed in a population of 373 dementia patients that came from out-patients clinic of cooperating wordplace. The disturbance in sleep behavior was surveyed with international Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) that included with or without sleep disorder and its frequency and level of severity. The score on product of multiplication of frequency and level of severity was the score of investigation. If the score was over 0, the sleep disorder existed. Meanwhile, 14 diseases, such as cerebral infarction, cardiac disease and diabetes, etc. were investigated, and their disease indexes were calculated as the sum of the number of above-mentioned disease, zero as non-suffering any above-mentioned disease, 14 as suffering all of above-mentioned diseases. Results: All the 3 108-commu nity participants and 373 dementia patients completed the survey and were involved in the result analysis. 1 Among the 3 108 community participants, 8.3% reported sleep disturbance, in which 29.1% reported one or more of the co-existing diseases, with heart disease, digestive disease and neurological disease being the most common. Multiple factor logistic regression analysis found that age, education level. and female were risk factors for sleep disturbance in community participants with the odds ratio (OR) of 1,22, 1.13, 1,32, respectively (P < 0.05). While cumulative disease index (OR=2.12) and education (OR=2.06) were risk factors for people aged 85 years old and above (P < 0.05). 2 Of the 373 demented individuals, 19.8% of them exhibited sleep disturbances, in which 68.9% reported one or more of the co-existing diseases, and 23.0% had three or more conditions, with heart, brain, lung disease and diabetes mellitus being the most common, of which there were significant differences when compared with participants without sleep disturbance (P < 0.05). The cumulative disease index and city residents were main risk factors for sleep disturbance in demented participants with the odds ratio of 1.45, 4.33, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The disturbance in sleep behavior is a frequent complaint in both normal aging and the dementias. Geriatric sleep complaint is not only the result of age per se, but also due to the co-exiting conditions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were considered to be going to develop into Alzheimer disease, and were the high-risk group of Alzheimer disease. OBJECTIVE: To study the implicit and explicit memory in the patient with amnestic MCI. DESIGN: Homochronous and controlled observation. SETTING: Neurological Department of the Southern Building of General Hospital of Chinese PLA. PARTICIPANTS: The research was carried out at Neurological Department of the Southern Building of General Hospital of Chinese PLA from January to June 2003. Totally 20 male patients with amnestic mild MCI, with the average age of (78.7\u00b14.9) years and the average educational time of (8.2\u00b11.0) years, selected from neurological out-patient clinic and ward of southern building of General Hospital of Chinese PLA, Complaint memory losing and confirmed by the relatives and close friends of the patients, Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) \u226524, activity of daily living (ADL) <26, and clinical dementia rating equal to 0.5, Objective memory examination score reduced compared to the examiners' educational background, the memory quotient recorded by clinical memory sheet to be 63-77 (lower than the normal value with 1.5-2.5 standard deviation), were accepted, and determined as experiment group.Totally 20 healthy male veterans selected from Beijing area, with the average age of (77.9\u00b14.7) years and the average educational time (8.1\u00b11.1) years were selected as control group. All subjects volunteered to take part in the examination. METHODS: Explicit memory included word free recall and re-recognition task. The Chinese characters were selected from the 1000 most commonly used ones in the books of primary and middle schools. The 30 double characters-words were chosen and randomly divided into two tasks. Recall task included 10 double character words that were target words. Re-recognition task included 20 double character words, of which one half were target words, and the other half were interfering words. Implicit memory included word free recall and character-root-complementary task. The Chinese characters were from the same source as mentioned before. Thirty Chinese characters were chosen in free recall task at beginning. These Chinese characters at least had possibility of composing over 4 commonly used double character-words in primary and middle school books. One double-Chinese character-word in four possibilities was randomly selected and the total was 30 words. Then these 30 words were divided into two groups, one was target group and the other was interfering word. All selected Chinese characters were composed either up-down structure or right-left structure. Taking a part of the Chinese character would leave a character-root. There were 30 character-roots and they were never the same each other. There were at least four possibilities to form a Chinese character for each root as properly matching among 1000 commonly used Chinese characters. At first, the subjects were asked to read the target words loudly for 3 times in 4 tasks and tried to remember all the target words (characters) and were told to test their memorization later on. The target words (or characters) would appear in one-minute interval. The subjects were asked to repeat the words (or characters) appeared before as many as possible based on their memory in free recall task and they did not have to remember the words (or characters) in order. The correct recall rate for 10 target words was calculated. In re-recognition task, the target words and interfering words were mixed up and appeared one by one in random order and the subjects were asked to tell if the words appeared before. The correct rate of 20-word re-recognition was calculated. In free recall task, the first character in target words was mixed with the first character in interfering words and they appeared one by one in random order. The subjects were asked to form any two-character-word with appeared Chinese characters and wrote down the first word thought of in test sheet. The hitting rate of target words and interfering words were calculated. t-test for independent samples was carried out respectively between the two groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: \u2460 Semantic priming effect (the hitting rate of target words in word free recall task and the hitting rate of interfering words) and apperception priming effect (the hitting rate of target words in character-root-complementary task and the hitting rate of interfering words) in the two groups. \u2461 Difference of explicit memory (correct rate of free recall and correct rate of re-recognition) and difference of semantic and apperception priming effect in the two groups. RESULTS: All subjects in the two groups completed the test and entered the final analysis. \u2460 Results of inner-group analysis: In the group of MCI, the hitting rate (0.41\u00b10.15) of target words in word free recall task was significantly higher than that of interfering words (0.31\u00b10.12, P < 0.01), suggesting that there existed semantic priming effect in the patients with amnestic MCI as completing this task. In the character-root-complementary task, the hitting rate of target words (0.17\u00b10.10) was significantly higher than that of the hitting rate of interfering words (0.10\u00b10.07, P < 0.05), suggesting that there existed perceptional priming effect in the patients with amnestic MCI as completing this task. In the control group, the hitting rate of target words (0.45\u00b10.11) was significantly higher than that of the interfering words (0.33\u00b10.10, P < 0.01), suggesting that there existed semantic priming effect in the elderly with normal perception as completing this task as well. In the character-root-complementary task, the hitting rate of target characters (0.18\u00b10.08) was higher than that of interfering characters (0.13\u00b10.07, P < 0.05), suggesting that there existed perceptional priming effect in the elderly with normal perception as completing this task as well. \u2461 Results of inter-groups analysis: Correct rates of free recall and re-recognition in the MCI group was decreased (0.10\u00b10.09, 0.45\u00b10.13, t=9.858, P=0.000; 0.69\u00b10.14, 0.83\u00b10.08, t=3.685, P=0.000). There was not significantly different in Sementic priming effect and perceptional priming effect both in the MCI group and the control group. CONCLUSION: Sementic priming effect and perceptional priming effect were existed both in the MCI experiment group and the control group, but the implicit memory was not significantly different in the two groups. However, the patients with forgetful style MCI were exhibited a decline in explicit memory. Memory function of mild MCI patients was shown double characteristics, i.e. damage of explicit memory and preservation of implicit memory. The double character in memorial function provided theoretical basis for the rehabilitative training of MCI patients.",

This paper attempted to evaluate the relationships among Chinese economy, energy and its impact of emissions during 1991-2009 using several novel indicators based on emergy, energy and monetary units. The results show that NH 3-N in wastewater has taken main responsibility for impact of emissions, the hidden environmental cost per unit economic output has been continuously reduced, education and R & D investment has cut pollutants generating intensity since 1997, and environmental protection investment has cut emission intensity since 1996. Generally speaking, the coordination degree of structure and scale of China's economy has been improved to different degree from 1991 to 2009. However, the growth of education and R & D investment and environmental protection investment has not prevented impact of emissions from increase caused by economic aggregate growth, and the turning point has not appeared in this period. Finally, this paper discusses some related issues and puts forward the corresponding suggestions. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this study, biogas slurry was applied in the production of oil-seed rape, it was attempted to investigate the effects of slurry on yield and quality of rape, furthermore to find the optimum rate of biogas slurry. The results showed that the protein, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) contents in rapeseed increased, the oleic acid, calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) contents in rapeseed firstly increased and then decreased with the increased rate of slurry. Meanwhile, the erucic acid, glucosinolate and oil contents showed a tendency of decrease with the increased rate of slurry. When the rate of slurry was in the range of 78,750 kg hm-2 to 101,250 kg hm-2, the yield reached a relatively high level, which was in the range of 2817kg hm-2 to 3433 kg hm-2. \u00a9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "\u201cDischarge of treated wastewater and sewage sludge landfilling\u201d are the most common practice, which poses threats to the local environment. In this work we first constructed a general sewage treatment ecosystem (STE) which integrated the three systems. Emergy synthesis, with several improved emergy-based indicators which considered the waste input contribution and impacts of emissions, was applied to evaluate two alternative scenarios (scenario 1: sewage treatment system + treated water discharge + sludge landfilling; scenario 2: sewage treatment subsystem + reclaimed water reuse subsystem + aerobic compost production subsystem) for Mingjingtan sewage treatment plant in Wanzhou City of Chongqing in China. Results point out the environmental pressure of scenario 2 is much smaller than scenario 1 although its economic performance is somewhat poorer than scenario 1, and finally the sustainability of scenario 2 is still much better than scenario 1. Therefore, the treated water and sewage sludge reuse can further improve the environmental benefit of the sewage treatment process; however, the STE should be optimized in order to enhance its economic benefit. The proposed methods can help policy-makers make decisions and guide designers and operators to improve the comprehensive performance of sewage treatment processes. In addition, this paper also briefly discusses wastewater integrated management strategy. Keywords Sewage treatment ecosystem Emergy based indicator Reclaimed water Sludge Sustainability 1 Introduction Municipal sewage treatment plants play an important role in the abatement of water pollution, but they also produce a large amount of sewage sludge and treated water. The discharge of large volumes of treated wastewater that contains low levels of chemical constituents may still lead to an excessive input of nutrients in a receiving water body ( Muga and Mihelcic, 2008 ). In 2008, the total wastewater discharge amount in China was 57.17 billion tons, 57.7% of which came from municipal domestic sewage; the total discharge amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 13.21 million tons, 65.4% of which came from municipal domestic sewage; the total discharge amount of ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) was 1.27 million tons, 76.6% of which came from municipal domestic sewage ( Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs, 2009 ). The main rivers were polluted to varying degrees and eutrophication that occurred in the main lakes (reservoirs) was serious in China this year ( Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China, 2009 ). Groundwater of nearly 90% of Chinese cities has been polluted to different degrees. However, per capita water supply in China is about one fourth of the world average level, and water pollution may be mainly responsible for the water scarcity of 136 cities in China. In many cases, managing sewage sludge consists of collection followed by disposal, usually away from urban activity, which could be waterways, open ocean or surface areas demarcated for the purpose, viz. landfills, and landfills may lead to subsurface pollution ( Bresters et al., 1997; Swanson et al., 2004 ). Moreover, with the increased volume and variety of hazardous waste products, the situation becomes more and more a public health concern ( Kollikkathara et al., 2009 ). Most sewage sludge in China is currently disposed into the landfill sites, and this short-sighted practice may lead to exhaustion of the landfill area in a couple of years and therefore is not sustainable ( Cherubini et al., 2008 ). Sixty percent of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2025, and improving urban water and wastewater management in the growing cities of the developing world is an urgent need ( Bahri, 2009 ). The provision of environmentally sound systems in an integrated way, taking into account the whole water cycle of water supply, wastewater, solid waste collection, treatment and reuse, is the best way forward to address this critical challenge ( Bahri, 2009 ). Several methods or amalgamations of some of them have been applied to evaluate wastewater treatment systems in recent years, such as eMergy analysis method ( Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 2001; Geber and Bj\u00f6rklund, 2002; Nelson et al., 2001; Gr\u00f6nlund et al., 2004; Siracusa and La Rosa, 2006; Chen et al., 2009 ), exergy analysis method ( Hellstr\u00f6m and K\u00e4rrman, 1997 ), life cycle assessment method ( \u00d8degaard, 1995; Gallego et al., 2008 ), sustainable process indices (SPI) ( Roggenbauer, 2005 ), amalgamation of several methods (such as LCA and eMergy analysis methods) ( Bengtsson et al., 1997 ), economic evaluation and energy analysis and/or other methods\u2019 amalgamation ( Ko et al., 2004; Muga and Mihelcic, 2008; Hellstr\u00f6m and K\u00e4rrman, 1997 ). A correct waste management policy should be based on the principles of sustainable development, according to which our refuse is not simply regarded as something to eliminate but rather as a potential resource to be recycled ( Marchettini et al., 2007 ). This requires an integrated waste management evaluation. For this purpose, several methods have been used to assess sewage sludge treatment or management, such as standard energy and LCA analysis methods ( Hara and Mino, 2008 ), economic evaluation ( Yin and Tan, 2005; European Commission DG Environment B/2, 2002 ), etc. Nowadays, wastewater reuse is becoming an economically and environmentally sound method for integrated water management. On the basis of wastewater availability for supplemental applications prior to discharge, water reuse appears to be a suitable practice with potentially beneficial use ( Janosova et al., 2006; Chu et al., 2004; Bahri, 2009 ). Wastewater reuse is an opportunity to shorten the hydrological cycle until the water is used again and can be utilized when it offers sufficient environmental, social, economic and political benefits ( Janosova et al., 2006 ). But this needs to be evaluated specifically for decision-making. At present, some methods have been applied to analyze the performances of reclaimed water reuse, such as economic analysis ( Chu et al., 2004; Janosova et al., 2006 ), economic evaluation method and risk assessment ( Hamilton et al., 2005 ), ecological analysis, standard energy analysis, risk assessment and economic analysis ( Sala and Serra, 2004 ), risk assessment ( Asano and Cotruvo, 2004 ), the sustainable process index (SPI) ( Roggenbauer, 2005 ), etc. All those studies mainly focused on a certain step of the total sewage treatment process, and fewer works focus on its comprehensive performance (including sewage treatment, treated water and sewage sludge disposal). The relationship between a sewage treatment system and its treated water disposal system and sewage sludge disposal system, to some degree, is like a simple ecosystem. Thus we may name the three systems \u201ca sewage treatment ecosystem (STE)\u201d. In an STE, one component can assimilate one or more wastes from another component and make some useful products for human being as far as possible under mankind's control. So the system continuously seeks maximizing the total products by optimizing the resource throughput with the development of science and technology for ensuring that all available resources will be utilized to the maximum possible extent and no unused resources will be left in future ( Ulgiati et al., 2007 ). Meanwhile, for a specific sewage treatment process, designers should not only consider how to make the effluent satisfy environmental discharge limits, but also try their best to find appropriate ways to reuse these by-products under the specific condition. Thus this requires decision-makers and designers take everything into account because resources become scarce and environmental pollution is serious today. An emergy synthesis approach has been applied to evaluate wastewater treatment systems and waste treatment or disposal systems ( Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 2001; Geber and Bj\u00f6rklund, 2002; Nelson et al., 2001; Gr\u00f6nlund et al., 2004; Siracusa and La Rosa, 2006; Chen et al., 2009; Marchettini et al., 2007; Lei and Wang, 2008; Vassallo et al., 2009 ), but this research has ignored the comprehensive performance of the sewage treatment process. The overall assessment of the wastewater treatment process has begun to be done using LCIAs by some researchers ( Renou et al., 2008 ). It is a good beginning in this respect; however, more emphasis should be given to a natural ecosystem's contributions to a wastewater treatment system and its by-products\u2019 disposal and control of the emissions\u2019 impacts on economy and environment. The goals of this paper are to construct a general sewage treatment ecosystem concept which integrates a wastewater treatment system and its by-products disposal system, then put up the improved eMergy-based indicators for assessing its sustainability. Finally, two scenarios for Mingjingtan sewage treatment plant in Wangzhou City of Chongqing in China, as a case, is applied to validate the proposed indicators. In 2008, the total wastewater discharge amount in Chongqing was 1.45 billion tons, 53.82% of which came from municipal domestic sewage; the total discharge amount of COD was 241.7 thousand tons, 58.13% of which came from municipal domestic sewage; the total discharge amount of NH 3 -N was 23.3 thousand tons, 64.38% of which came from municipal domestic sewage (Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs, 2008). The water pollution in Chongqing is embodied in the Three Gorges Reservoirs\u2019 water pollution. Three Gorges Dam started construction in 1994 and it started impoundment in 2003. Three Gorges Dam leads to the water level of the reservoirs\u2019 water body being raised and reduces its velocity of flow, thus weakens its environmental capacity and self-purification capacity. At present, although its water quality generally meet the requirement for the living and production, water blooms have appeared in some water areas frequently, mainly caused by excessive nitrogen and phosphorus in the water body ( Wei et al., 2009 ). Therefore, this case study can provide beneficial suggestions for the local wastewater integrated management. 2 Research objective Sewage treatment strategies should aim at maximizing energy and material recovery while minimizing the final amount of emissions delivered to environment. These targets should be in conjunction with appropriate technological options that emulate natural cycles and dynamics. Meanwhile, the holistic view from industrial ecology indicates that solving problems must involve understanding the connections that exist between these systems, various aspects cannot be viewed in isolation ( Wikipedia, 2008 ). Therefore, a sewage treatment system and its treated water disposal system and sewage sludge disposal system should form a holistic system, here named a sewage treatment ecosystem (STE). Fig. 1 shows its structures and flows. There are six kinds of flows: the first and the second are the free resources flows and waste flows between environmental system and the STE, respectively; the third and the fourth are the purchased input flows and current flows between economic system and the STE, respectively; the fifth and the sixth are the products flows and current flows between economic system and the STE, respectively. The sewage treatment system provides the sludge disposal system and the treated water disposal system with dewatered sludge and treated water, respectively. Wanzhou district is located on the northeastern brim of Chongqing City in China, lies between longitudes 107\u00b055\u203222\u2033E and 108\u00b053\u203225\u2033E and between latitudes 30\u00b024\u203225\u2033N and 31\u00b014\u203258\u2033N. Wanzhou lies within the humid semitropical monsoon climate zone, with an average annual temperature of 17.7 \u00b0C, an annual average hours of sunshine of 1484.4 h, an annual average precipitation of 1243 mm, and an annual average water surface evaporation 620 mm. Wangzhou City is a mountainous city with rare natural vegetation, currently covers an area of 41 km 2 , and has a total population of 5.95 \u00d7 10 5 . Mingjingtan sewage treatment plant is located in the city. This plant adopted the craft of Orbal oxidation ditch (see Fig. 2 ). Its investment was $10,101,250, and it started working in July 2003. The plant has a capacity to treat 30,000 tons sewage per day, and its effluent standard is shown in Table 1 . At present, the treated water is discharged into Yangtze River, the required quality standards for surface water is shown in Table 2 . Its dewatered sludge is disposed in landfills and the landfill leachate is piped into another sewage treatment plant. However, the sewage sludge with high water content (>80%) often makes the landfill site become \u201ca swampland\u201d, which affected the normal operation of the landfill plant, and even shorten its lifetime; meanwhile, too much landfill leachate also affected the effluent quality. As a result, sewage treatment plants refuse to accept the landfill leachate and landfill plants are unwilling to accept sewage sludge. This case will cause many potential and actual environmental problems. Here we considered two scenarios: Scenario 1 \u2013 sewage treatment system + treated water discharge + sludge landfilling: this is the present case of Mingjingtan sewage treatment plant. Treated water from the sewage treatment system is discharged into Yangtze River. Scenario 2 \u2013 sewage treatment subsystem + reclaimed water reuse subsystem + aerobic compost production subsystem: the three subsystems form a sewage treatment ecosystem. Treated water from the sewage treatment subsystem is deeply treated and then reused for landscape, gardening, etc. According to the research of Shen et al. (2007) , the craft of reclaimed water reuse is shown in Fig. 3 . The water quality standard of reclaimed water reuse in China is shown in Table 3 . Dewatered sludge is used as raw material of aerobic compost production subsystem. Fig. 4 shows the composing craft ( Bai, 2004 ). 3 Methods 3.1 Emergy synthesis approach and the traditional eMergy indicators The emergy synthesis approach is an integrated evaluation method for ecological-economic systems and has been successfully applied to systems of different scales ( Brown and Ulgiati, 2004 ). Emergy (or embodied energy) is defined as the available energy of one kind previously used up directly or indirectly to make a product or service ( Odum, 1996 ). In emergy accounting, both environmental and economic inputs, including energy, materials, labor and currency, are all converted into solar emergy equivalents. The renewable energy and resources, like sunlight, wind, rain, and tides, which are usually regarded as free externalities of the production process in economics, are included in emergy accounting as significant environmental support. An eMergy synthesis considers the historical accumulation of all the energy used in a production process and provides a universal measure for the different kinds of energy flows in a system network. A system is evaluated through the analysis of energy, mass, information, and currency flows ( Sciubba and Ulgiati, 2005; Bastianoni et al., 2007 ). The algorithm for emergy accounting has been given by Odum (1996) . The total annual emergy inflow to the biosphere from the sun, moon, and deep heat sources from the earth make up the baseline. The baseline emergy is the driving force for everything physically happening in the biosphere, together with the storages (e.g. fossil fuels, ores, forest biomass, soil organic content) previously built up by the annual eMergy inflow and used at rates far exceeding their replacement rate. The amount of input eMergy dissipated per unit output exergy is called solar transformity. The latter can be considered a \u201cquality\u201d factor which functions as a measure of the intensity of biosphere support to the product under study. The total solar eMergy of a product may be calculated as: (solar eMergy) = (exergy of the product) \u00d7 (solar transformity). Solar eMergy is usually measured in solar eMergy joules (seJ), while the unit for solar transformity is solar eMergy joules per joule of product (seJ/J). Sometimes eMergy per unit mass of product or eMergy per unit of currency are also used (seJ/g, seJ/$, etc.). In doing so, all kinds of flows to a system are expressed in the same unit (seJ of solar eMergy) and have a built-in quality factor to account for the conversion of input flows through the biosphere hierarchy. Emergy accounting is organized as a top down approach where first systems diagrams of processes are drawn to organize evaluations and account for all inputs and outflows from the system. Tables of the actual flows of materials, labor, and energy are constructed from the diagrams and all flows are evaluated. The different units for each flow are multiplied by transformities to convert them into solar eMergy. As a result of this procedure, a set of indices and ratios suitable for policymaking ( Brown and Ulgiati, 2004 ) can be calculated. Some indices based on eMergy analysis have been introduced to describe a system and to evaluate the sustainability of a process ( Yang et al., 2003; Zhelev and Ridolfi, 2006; Brown and Ulgiati, 1997; Brown and Ulgiati, 2002; Ulgiati and Brown, 2002; Lu et al., 2003; Cao and Feng, 2007 ). Here we listed the following three eMergy based indicators used in our study. 3.1.1 Emergy yield ratio ( EYR ) EYR is the ratio of the sum of renewable eMergy ( R ) and nonrenewable eMergy ( N ) and purchased eMergy ( F ) to the purchased emergy ( F ). According to Ulgiati and Brown (2002) , EYR values below 5 denote primary materials, such as cement and steel, and secondary energy resources. Primary energy resources usually have an EYR > 5, and processes with an eMergy yield ratio less than 2 do not contribute to as energy sources and are associated to consumables or manufacturing processes. By comparing EYR values, one can understand the competition ability or economic benefit of a resource. Low values of EYR denote weak competition ability and low economic benefit when a resource is developed. On the contrary, high values of EYR denote strong competition ability and high economic benefit. 3.1.2 Environmental loading ratio ( ELR ) ELR is the ratio of the sum of nonrenewable eMergy ( N ) and purchased eMergy ( F ) to the renewable eMergy ( R ). According to Cao and Feng (2007) , Low values of ELR (nearly 2) indicate low environmental impact or processes having a large area to dilute their total impact. When ELR > 10, there is a high environmental loading, and when 3 < ELR < 10, the impact is considered moderate. For extremely high values of ELR , the nonrenewable inputs and/or the purchased inputs predominate, suggesting that the offer of local renewable inputs is not enough to supply the process demands. Therefore, this index is high for systems with high nonrenewable resources consumption and/or with high emissions. 3.1.3 Sustainability index ( SI ) It is the ratio of the EYR to the ELR . This index reflects the ability of a system in providing desired products or services with a minimum environmental stress and a maximum profit. Cao and Feng (2007) think that when SI < 1, products and processes are not sustainable in the long term. Systems presenting 1 < SI < 5 may have a sustainable contribution to the economy for medium periods, and processes with SI > 5 can be considered sustainable in the long term. But it is incorrect to think that the higher SI , the better the sustainability, because when SI > 10, the system is underdeveloped. 3.2 Improved eMergy based indicators for assessing a sewage treatment ecosystem According to the concept of \u201csewage treatment ecosystem\u201d, its general eMergy flow system diagram could be drawn, in which emissions impact and waste contribution were also considered (see Fig. 5 ). According to Fig. 5 , an STE's input eMergy equals the sum of eMergy of wastes W (such as sewage inflow), the total eMergy of renewable resources (including R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 from sewage treatment subsystem, the corresponding treated water disposal subsystem and dewatered sludge disposal subsystem, respectively, such as hydroelectricity, air, etc.), the total eMergy of nonrenewable resources (including N 1 , N 2 , and N 3 from the three subsystems respectively, such as chemical reagent, etc.), and the total purchased input eMergy (including F 1 , F 2 , F 3 from the three subsystems, respectively, such as purchasing ground, equipment, technology, information, electricity, commodities and service, etc.). Its output eMergy includes the eMergy of the products and emitted wastes. Here we also considered the emissions\u2019 impacts (including W E1 , W E2 , and W E3 from the three subsystems, respectively), which are described in Section 3.2.1 . 3.2.1 Quantifying the impacts of emissions Emissions from industrial processes can harm the ecosystem, people, and the economy; they may require eMergy to render them harmless ( Yang et al., 2003 ), which can be done by diluting or degrading the emissions to an acceptable concentration or state. 3.2.1.1 Ecological services needed to render emissions harmless This eMergy to absorb impact may be derived from both ecological and economic sources. Many emissions are rendered harmless due to services provided by the ecosystem which dilute or degrade the emissions to an acceptable concentration or state. The eMergy for these ecological services may be determined from knowledge of the concentration and nature of the emissions, and the transformity of the relevant ecological services. We calculated the ecological services for diluting emissions according to the research of Ulgiati and Brown (2002) . Here, we considered the air and water emissions in the sewage treatment process. Although they had been treated before released into environment, the emission concentrations of some of them were still higher than the corresponding environment quality standards. Therefore, the ecological services were needed to dilute their concentration to the acceptable level. The ecological services are environmental self-purification, which includes physical, chemical and biological processes, and it is often the last step of pollutions\u2019 control measures because it is very difficult for all industrial processes to achieve complete zero emissions. Here we considered only the environmental dilution. Ecological services for diluting air pollutants can be counted as follows: firstly, the mass of air required to dilute each emission can be attained according to (1) M = d \u00d7 W c \u2212 M air where M is the mass of dilution air, unit: g; M air is the mass of discharged air from sewage treatment process, unit: g; d is the air density, here it is 1.29E03 g/m 3 ; W is the annual amount of a given air emission from sewage treatment process; c is the acceptable concentration from agreed regulations (see Table 4 ). Then, the energy value of required environmental services is determined, by calculating the kinetic energy of the dilution air, using average value for wind speed in the area (here, the average value for wind speed was 0.70 m/s in a year, Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China, 2006\u20132009 ). This energy is a measure of the wind energy needed to dilute pollutants. Finally, when multiplied by the wind transformity 1.50E03 seJ/J ( Ulgiati and Brown, 2002 ), it gives a measure of the environmental service that is required, in units of eMergy. Ecological services for diluting water pollutants can be counted as follows: firstly, the mass of water required to dilute each pollutant can be calculated according to (2) M = d \u00d7 W c \u2212 M water where M is the mass of dilution water, g; M water is the mass of water drainage from sewage treatment process, g; d is water density, it is 1.00E06 g/m 3 ; W is the annual amount of a given water pollutant from sewage treatment process, g or unit; and c is the acceptable concentration from agreed regulations (see Table 4 .). Then, the energy needed to dilute water pollutants is determined when the mass of dilution water is multiplied by the average value of physical energy of surface runoff in China. When the energy is multiplied by the transformity of global flowing water in river 2.78E04 seJ/J ( Lan et al., 2002 ), it gives a measure of the environmental service that is required, in units of eMergy. 3.2.1.2 The eMergy loss caused by emissions Some emissions may harm the ecosystem by causing a fish kill, lake eutrophication, etc.; and they also lead to economic loss by harming human health, land occupation, etc. Such effects may be quantified as the eMergy contained in the ecological and economic loss. Many studies have estimated the monetary loss of environmental impact. This may be easily converted to eMergy via the eMergy/money ratio. Quantifying the ecological impact in terms of eMergy requires knowledge about the loss of ecosystem components and self-organization caused by the emissions ( Bakshi, 2000 ). Ecological impact is represented by the Potentially Affected Fraction (PAF) or Potentially Disappeared Fraction (PDF) of species in the affected ecosystem ( Bakshi, 2002 ). This analysis uses ecological models which are currently restricted to the Netherlands or Europe. The output of a LCIA approach such as eco-indicator 99 may be converted to a corresponding exergy loss or eMergy input. Here the ecological losses caused by emissions were not considered due to lacking the corresponding data. We calculated the economic loss caused by emissions according to the references ( Ulgiati et al., 1995; Ukidwe and Bakshi, 2007 ). The loss included air pollutants\u2019 impacts on human health, and land occupation caused by solid wastes. Air emission impact on human health include respiratory disorders, climate change, etc. ( Ukidwe and Bakshi, 2007 ). Disability adjusted life years (DALY) measures the impact on human well being ( Bakshi, 2002 ). This represents the years of life lost and years lived disabled due to the impact of emissions, and it is based on an approach developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Industrial emissions affect human health in myriad ways. The actual impact depends on the fate of a pollutant in the natural environment and its effect on human well being. The fate itself depends on numerous physico-chemical phenomena such as dispersion, diffusion and atmospheric chemistry. There are several established procedures for calculating the impact of emissions on human health. The approach employed in this analysis represents the impact of several common pollutants on human health in terms of DALY. This is an end-point impact assessment methodology that considers several impact categories including respiratory disorders, climate change, etc. ( Hofstetter, 1998; Goedkoop and Spriensma, 1999 ). Table 6 lists several air pollutants considered in this work, the impact categories they belong to and corresponding DALY values per gram of emission. Ukidwe and Bakshi (2004) discussed the approach for converting DALYs to ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC). Relationship between DALY and ECEC is linear, and 1 DALY/day of human health impact corresponds to 9.35E13 seJ/day of impact in ECEC terms. Furthermore, conversion of DALY into ECEC is necessary only if it is desired to have a single numeraire for comparing diverse flows of ecosystem goods and services, human resources and emissions and their impact on human health. ECEC is an extension of industrial cumulative exergy consumption to include ecosystems, and it becomes equivalent to eMergy if the analysis boundary, allocation approach, and method for combining global energy inputs are identical ( Hau and Bakshi, 2004 ). Then we can count the eMergy value of emission impacts on human health according to ECEC values of emissions. This study just considered the four air pollutants indicated in Table 5 . Other pollutants were not considered. Land occupation can measure discharged solid waste impacts on the environment. According to the reference ( Wang et al., 2006a,b ), 2.85 \u00d7 10 4 tons industrial solid wastes approximately occupy 1 ha land. According to the reference ( Odum, 2000 ), an average annual eMergy value of land is obtained from the average rate of erosion and replacement, and the transformity of land area sustained is 1.05E15 seJ/ha. Thus the eMergy loss can be attained using the total occupied land area multiplied by the transformity. 3.2.2 Improved eMergy based indicators for assessing an STE Then we can construct the following improved eMergy based indicators for assessing an STE. (1) EYR : it is Emergy yield ratio of an STE. This indicator can be expressed as follow: (3) E Y R = ( W + R + N + F ) F Here, W : emergy of wastes input, such as sewage inflow; R = R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ; N = N 1 + N 2 + N 3 ; F = F 1 + F 2 + F 3 . Unit: seJ/a. (2) ELR : it is environmental loading ratio of an STE. Since the main goal of an STE is to remove or reduce environmental pressure, how will the environmental pressure change after the STE's implement compared with before? Therefore, we should consider the emissions\u2019 impacts from the STE and integrate it into ELR . The improved EYR can be expressed as follow: (4) E L R = ( N + F + W E ) R Here, W E : emissions\u2019 impacts, W E = EL + ES. EL: eMergy loss caused by emissions; ES: ecological services needed to dilute air and water pollutants to an acceptable level. Unit: seJ/a. (3) SI : it is ASUSTAINABILITY index of an STE, defined as the ratio of EYR to ELR , and it reflects the relative sustainability of sewage treatment ecosystem. This indicator can be expressed as follow: (5) S I = E Y R E L R The eMergy system diagrams of scenarios 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , and the two scenarios\u2019 eMergy analysis tables are shown in Tables 6 and 7 . 4 Results and analysis 4.1 Emissions\u2019 impacts Emission impacts are shown in Table 8 . For scenario 1, the value of emission impacts was 2.40E20 seJ/a, which mainly came from ecological services (99.99%), next came from eMergy loss (0.01%). And most of ecological services came from water environment service needed to dilute water pollutants, especially diluting TN. For scenario 2, the value of emission impacts was 2.38E16 seJ/a, which mainly came from eMergy loss (97.94%), next came from ecological services (2.06%). And those impacts of scenario 2 were all caused by air pollutants. Therefore, the emission impacts are greatly reduced after the treated water and dewatered sludge being reused. However, the air emission impacts should be further emphasized for scenario 2. 4.2 Emergy flows The two scenarios\u2019 eMergy flows are shown in Table 9 . The ratios of W , R , N and F to the total input eMergy for each scenario are shown in Table 10 . For scenario 1, it was found out that more than 96% of input eMergy came from wastes input, about 1.4% came from renewable inputs, about 0.1% came from nonrenewable inputs, and about 2.4% came from purchased inputs. For scenario 2, more than 93.3% of input eMergy came from wastes input, about 2.3% came from renewable inputs, about 0.2% came from nonrenewable inputs, and about 4.2% came from purchased inputs. Therefore, nonrenewable and renewable input eMergy was much less than wastes input eMergy in the total input eMergy for the two scenarios, which was consistent with the research of Vassallo et al. (2009) . 4.3 Emergy based indicators The values of the traditional and improved eMergy based indicators for the two scenarios were calculated, respectively and shown in Table 11 . According to the results of the traditional eMergy based indicators, the value of EYR for scenario 2 was decreased by 2.57%, the value of ELR for scenario 2 was increased by 5.62%, and the value of SI for scenario 2 was decreased by 7.76%, compared with scenario 1; and this means that scenario 2 has weaker competitive ability and higher environmental stress than scenario 1 does. Therefore, the sustainability of scenario 2 is lower than that of scenario 1. According to the improved based indicators\u2019 results, the value of EYR for scenario 2 was decreased by 42.15%, the value of ELR for scenario 2 was decreased by 97.39%, and the value of SI for scenario 2 was increased by 95.95%, compared with scenario 1; therefore, scenario 2 has weaker competitive ability but much lower environmental stress than scenario 2. As a result, scenario 2 is still more sustainable than scenario 1. In scenario 2, the values of the three subsystems\u2019 improved eMergy based indices were shown in Table 12 . It was found that the value of EYR of the reclaimed water reuse subsystem was the biggest, next came from the sewage treatment subsystem, and the value of EYR of the aerobic compost production subsystem was the smallest; the value of ELR of the sewage treatment subsystem was the biggest, next came from the reclaimed water reuse subsystem, and the value of ELR of the aerobic compost production subsystem was the smallest; the value of SI of the aerobic compost production subsystem was the biggest, next came from the reclaimed water reuse subsystem, and the value of SI of the sewage treatment subsystem was the smallest. Therefore, the reclaimed water reuse subsystem has the strongest competition, the sewage treatment subsystem has the greatest pressure on environment, and the aerobic compost production subsystem is the most sustainable among the three subsystems. 5 Discussion In this study emissions\u2019 impacts were quantified in the term of eMergy, and they were integrated into improved eMergy based indicators. The differences between the traditional indicators and the improved ones lie in the former ignoring emissions\u2019 impacts and wastes input's contribution. The results from the case study show that the constructed STE has predominant environmental performance although its economic performance is somewhat weaker than the traditional end-of-pipe treatment here. The case is only used to validate the proposed indicators, and the results may be different in other occasions. In addition, emissions from the reclaimed water reuse subsystem and the aerobic compost production subsystem were not considered for lacking the available data, maybe the environmental load was underestimated more or less. These do not affect the proposed indicators\u2019 effectiveness. The approach proposed not only can be used to analyze alternative scenarios and each subsystem in one wastewater treatment process, but also offers a framework for assessing how to combine these different procedures into a complementary and comprehensive model of analysis. This approach can consider and compare a global environmental strategy that might include the use of different sewage treatment ecosystems composed of different sewage treatment crafts and treated water disposal crafts and sewage sludge disposal crafts, since it is able to account for all of the resources used in any phase and in the total process of the system and locate the correct eMergy use in accordance with the benefit obtained. In the light of the required creative process, it must be underscored that the described sewage management scenarios represent a gradual technological improvement which does not solve the problem completely (For example, from the viewpoint of lifecycle, there are some environmental impacts when aerobic compost is applied for agricultural production, which is out of the scope of this paper.), but this paper provides better knowledge about it. Even if other better scenarios could gradually approach the upper levels by means of technological improvement and enhancing material and energy efficiency, there is a level where technology seems unable to provide the basis for further steps. If we remain trapped within a purely technological improvement strategy, \u201czero wastewater/zero emissions\u201d may be an unreachable target. Thus, in order to solve the issue of wastewater treatment, not only we should rely on building new technologically advanced treatment plants, but also we should implement wastewater prevention policies, based on the higher levels of the pyramid (\u201cRecycle\u201d and \u201cReuse\u201d), as well as on redesigning our production and consumption patterns towards the ideal condition of wastewater prevention, wastewater reuse. 6 Conclusion This paper constructed a sewage treatment ecosystem, including a sewage treatment system and its treated water disposal system and dewatered sludge disposal system. Through considering the economic and environmental impacts of wastes treatment and disposal, emissions\u2019 impacts, and wastes input\u2019 s contribution, this paper constructed the improved eMergy based indicators for evaluating the sustainability of the holistic system. With EYR and ELR and SI , it is demonstrated how it is possible to analyze the economic benefit, environmental pressure, and sustainability of different sewage treatment ecosystems. The results from the case study show that the improved eMergy based indicators are more rigorous than the traditional ones; wastes reuse can improve the environmental performance of the STE greatly while this somewhat weakens the sewage treatment process\u2019 economic performance, but its sustainability is still greatly enhanced. In order to improve the economic and environmental performance of an STE, the sewage treatment subsystem should be firstly emphasized, including: controlling investment, such as strengthening research and evaluation of project feasibility, technology innovation, design and construction optimization, controlling manufacturing cost during engineering implementation, final accounts and auditing of completed project, etc.; reducing operating cost, such as norm management of electrical energy consumption, perfecting gauge work and management of related all electrical equipments and circuits, strengthening daily management of all king of materials, etc. Then the reclaimed water reuse system should be also improved, such as deciding on rational goals of reclaimed water reuse according to the local conditions, choosing the proper craft of reclaimed water reuse, determining reasonable price of the reclaimed water, etc. Of course, the related laws and regulations should be enacted and/or perfected, such as confirming the position of reclaimed water and sludge reuse, making the related technical standards, etc., besides the corresponding mature technologies. In addition, air emissions\u2019 impacts from wastewater treatment processes should be emphasized in future. The improved eMergy based indicators can form a set of useful tools to compare the comprehensive performances of different sewage treatment processes for decision-making and optimizing the whole process.

        "abstract": "Isoprene is one of the most important non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) in the troposphere: it is a significant precursor of O(3) and it affects the oxidative state of the atmosphere. The diastereoisomeric 2-methyltetrols, 2-methylthreitol and 2-methylerythritol, are marker compounds of the photooxidation products of atmospheric isoprene. In order to obtain valuable information on the delta(13)C value of isoprene in the atmosphere, the stable carbon isotopic compositions of the 2-methyltetrols in ambient aerosols were investigated. The 2-methyltetrols were extracted from filter samples and derivatized with methylboronic acid, and the delta(13)C values of the methylboronate derivatives were determined by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). The delta(13)C values of the 2-methyltetrols were then calculated through a simple mass balance equation between the 2-methyltetrols, methylboronic acid and the methylboronates. The delta(13)C values of the 2-methyltetrols in aerosol samples collected at the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserves in eastern China were found to be -24.66 +/- 0.90 per thousand and -24.53 +/- 1.08 per thousand for 2-methylerythritol and 2-methylthreitol, respectively. Based on the measured isotopic composition of the 2-methyltetrols, the average delta(13)C value of atmospheric isoprene is inferred to be close to or slightly heavier than -24.66 per thousand at the collection site during the sampling period.",

        "abstract": "A study was conducted regarding the biological nitrogen removal from the livestock and poultry breeding wastewater (LPBWs) using a novel sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR). Nitrogen removal process was studied under three aeration strategies/modes, referred to as MODE 1, 2, and 3. The results showed that MODE 2 (one operation period: instant fill of LPBWs, 3.0 h aeration, 1.5 h non-aeration, 1.5 h aeration, 1.0 h non-aeration and rapid drain of treated LPBWs) performed the best in nitrogen removal. Under MODE 2, the removal efficiencies were as high as 96.1 and 92.1% for NH\u2083-N and TN, respectively. Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND), as well as shortcut nitrification and denitrification are likely to be the two main mechanisms for the nitrogen removal in this study. Nitrifying bacteria were not inhibited by heterotrophic bacteria with C/N ratios ranging from 18.1 to 21.4 and DO concentration of 2.0 mg/l. Alternation between aeration and non-aeration played an important role in NO\u2082\u207b accumulation.",

        "abstract": "The chopped sweet sorghum stalk was thin-layer-dried for long-term storage and ethanol production. The drying kinetics and the effects of drying temperature on the qualities of sweet sorghum stalk were investigated in this work. The results showed that the drying process could be simulated well by Wang and Singh's model. The diffusivity constant ( D 0 ) and active energy ( E a ) were estimated as 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 m 2 /s and 21.4 kJ/(mol K) for drying the chopped fresh stalk. According to the sugar composition, browning degree, and fermentability of the dried stalk obtained at various temperatures, the approximate drying temperature could be suggested as 50\u201360 \u00b0C for application. In this range, the moisture of the chopped fresh stalk could drop below the safe moisture for storage in 7\u20135.5 h with 12.1\u20139.7% total sugar loss during the drying process. Keywords Sweet sorghum stalk Thin-layer drying Kinetics Quality Ethanol production 1 Introduction Sweet sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench ] is a high-yielding sugar crop that has many advantages such as wide climate adaptability, tolerance to abiotic stresses like drought, water logging, salinity, and alkalinity ( Li et al., 2010; Rooney et al., 2007 ). Meanwhile, sweet sorghum stalk contains several different soluble (glucose, fructose and sucrose) and insoluble carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose) ( Prasad et al., 2007; Sipos et al., 2009 ). Among the crops currently being actively investigated for bioenergy, sweet sorghum is the most promising one, particularly for bioethanol production ( Gnansounou et al., 2005 ). However, there are a few disadvantages with sweet sorghum. The primary disadvantages are the seasonal availability and short storage duration of the stalk. Consequently, there is high cost associated with long-term storage and seasonal labor requirements ( Bennett and Anex, 2009 ). Especially, storage must be initiated immediately after harvest, because the stalk/juice is rich in soluble sugar and can be easily deteriorated in natural conditions. The previous processing methods mainly focused on the stalk juice storage, such as condensation for syrup (>40%), sterilization by high temperature, storage in low temperature (<\u221220 \u00b0C), and addition of preservatives ( Billa et al., 1997; Mamma et al., 1995; Ning et al., 1995; Shen and Liu, 2010 ). Some researches also focused on the stalk storage technology, such as the atmosphere packaging and SO 2 impregnation ( Eckhoff et al., 1985; Mei et al., 2008 ). A recent study has demonstrated that chopped fresh sweet sorghum stalk was dried in open-air sun conditions, and the dried stalk could be stored well without significant sugar loss for at least 8 months ( Shen and Liu, 2009 ). This offered a practical and effective solution to the storage stream of \u201csoghnol\u201d production on-farm. However, the potential problem for this method was that the drying processes were seriously restricted by the weather during the harvest period. In order to make the storage method more applicable, the forced drying process was considered as an auxiliary way to meet the need of emergency from the unstable weather. Recently, many studies have been reported on thin-layer drying of agricultural products, fruits, and food materials ( Ahmed et al., 2001; Akpinar, 2006; Baini and Langrish, 2007; Doymaz, 2009; Ertekin and Yaldiz, 2004; HacIhafIzoglu et al., 2008; Hassan and Hobani, 2000; Janjai et al., 2011; Mazutti et al., 2010 ). However, the researches about thin-layer drying of chopped sweet sorghum stalk are rather rare. Therefore, it is essential to know the thin-layer drying characteristics and the quality of the dried products. In this context, the main objectives of present work were to investigate the drying kinetics of the chopped sweet sorghum stalk. Meanwhile, the effects of temperature on the qualities of chopped stalk, including sugar composition, browning degree and fermentability, were also investigated to determine an approximate drying temperature. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sweet sorghum Sweet sorghum cultivar, Chuntian No 1, was used for this work. The leaves of sweet sorghum were stripped before the fresh stalks were chopped into 4-mm in length using a small scale industry chopping machine (9PR-1.6, Forestry and Agricultural Machinery Plant, Dandong, Liaoning Province, China). The chopped fresh stalk was sealed in a plastic bag in a \u221220 \u00b0C freezer for further use. 2.2 Drying process The chopped fresh stalk (300 g) was dried at temperature of 30 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, 60 \u00b0C, and 70 \u00b0C in an air-ventilated oven (DHG9037, Jinghong Instruments Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) with natural convective airflow of 0.01 m/s. The oven for this work had a similar construction with the referred work ( Hii et al., 2009 ). The chopped fresh stalk was spread thinly in single layer (1.0 cm in thickness) on a meshed tray with 15 cm in diameter. Heat was generated by the heater integrated into the walls of the oven. The exhaust air escaped through a ventilation hole (diameter = 4 cm) at the back of the oven. \u223c2.0 g samples were taken periodically from the tray for the measurement of moisture, sugar content and browning degree. 2.3 Moisture content The measurement of moisture content was performed according to the protocol of the standard air oven method ( Jain and Singh, 2000 ). The moisture content calculation was based on the following equation. (1) M \u2009\u200a\u200a ( dry basis ) = W w \u2212 W d W d where M is the chopped sweet sorghum moisture content (d.b.), W w is the wet weight and W d is the dried weight of the sample. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. 2.4 Sugar content The sugars in chopped sweet sorghum stalk, including sucrose and reducing sugars (glucose + fructose), were determined by DNS (3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid) method. The detailed protocol for sugar extraction from stalk and the further analysis were based on Shen and Liu (2009) . 2.5 Browning degree (BD) The protocol for BD determination was according to Wang et al. (2006) . The samples for the BD determination were obtained from the step of the extraction before the sugar determination. The extracted liquid was diluted properly and measured at the absorbance of 420 nm with a spectrophotometer (Unico-2000, Unico Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) using 10 mm path length cells. 2.6 Fermentability The dried stalk was ground in 2.5\u20132.8 mm and rehydrated in high pressure sterilization with 121 \u00b0C for 10 min. In order to make a comparison on the fermentation between fresh stalk and dried stalk, a suitable amount of water should be supplemented for rehydration. The amount of water supplemented for rehydration could be calculated according to the difference of moisture content between the fresh and dried stalk. Solid state fermentation was employed for the evaluation of fermentability. 50.0 g rehydrated stalk was used as the substrate. The cell inoculation rate of 1\u2030 (wt/wt) dry active yeast (Angel Yeast Co., Ltd. Yichang City, Hubei Province of China, China) was inoculated for ethanol fermentation, and no extra nutrients were supplemented. The fermentation was carried out in cylinder flasks with the inoculation temperature of 35 \u00b0C for 48 h. The final ethanol was detected using a GC (SHIMADZU 2010, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) after the ethanol extraction according to the description in Shen and Liu (2009) . The ethanol yield was applied for the comparison of fermentability in different treatments. It was defined as the following equation. (2) Ethanol yield ( % ) = Ethanol content 0.51 \u2009 Total sugar content \u00d7 100 % where ethanol content refers to the obtained ethanol in substrate after fermentation (mg/g stalk, dry basis). Total sugar content refers to the total soluble sugar in fermentation substrate (mg/g stalk, dry basis). 2.7 Mathematical modeling of the thin-layer drying kinetics For investigation of drying characteristics of the chopped stalk, it is important to try to represent as accurate as possible the drying behavior. In this work, the experimental drying data at different temperatures were fitted using 9 classical thin-layer drying models, listed in Table 1 ( Akpinar et al., 2003; Ayensu, 1997; Midilli et al., 2002; Torul and Pehlivan, 2002; Wang et al., 2007; Yaldiz et al., 2001 ). In these models, MR represents the dimensionless moisture ratio (d.b.), namely: (3) MR = ( M \u2212 M e ) ( M 0 \u2212 M e ) where M is the moisture content of the stalk, M 0 is the initial moisture content of the fresh stalk and M e is the equilibrium moisture content. Statistical parameters such as the correlation coefficient ( R 2 ), chi-square ( \u03c7 2 ) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were used to assess the goodness of fitting. Generally, the higher R 2 and the lower \u03c7 2 and RMSE values are, the better model fitting is. The chi-square ( \u03c7 2 ) and RMSE could be calculated as follows: (4) \u03c7 2 = \u2211 i = 1 N ( MR exp , i \u2212 MR pred , i ) 2 N \u2212 z (5) RMSE = 1 N ( MR exp , i \u2212 MR pred , i ) 2 where MR exp, i and MR pred, i are the i th experimental and predicted moisture ratio, respectively. N is the number of observations and z is the number of parameters. In this work, the nonlinear or linear regression analysis and the calculation of mentioned statistical parameters were performed using the software of Matlab V7.1 R14 (the MathWorks, Inc. Natick, MA, USA). 2.8 Effective diffusivity and activation energy It has been accepted that the drying characteristics of biological products in falling rate period could be described by Fick's diffusion equation. The solution to this equation developed by Crank could be used for various regularly shaped bodies such as rectangular, cylindrical and spherical products. The form of Eq. (6) could be applicable for particles with slab geometry by assuming uniform initial moisture distribution ( Crank, 1979; Mazutti et al., 2010 ). (6) MR = 8 \u03c0 2 \u2211 n = 0 \u221e 1 ( 2 n + 1 ) 2 \u2212 ( 2 n + 1 ) 2 \u03c0 2 D e f f t 4 L 0 2 where D eff is the effective diffusivity (m 2 /s) and L 0 is the half thickness of slab (m). For long drying time, Eq. (6) could be further simplified to retain only the first term. It could be rewritten as Eq. (7) in a logarithmic form ( Mazutti et al., 2010 ). Diffusivity could be typically determined by plotting experimental drying data in terms of ln MR versus drying time in Eq. (8) , and calculated by the slope of the providing a straight line. (7) ln \u2009 MR = ln 8 \u03c0 2 \u2212 \u03c0 2 D eff 4 L 0 2 t The effective moisture diffusivity could be related with temperature by simple Arrhenius equation as given below ( Arumuganathan et al., 2009 ): (8) D eff = D 0 \u2009 exp \u2212 E a R T where D eff is the effective moisture diffusivity (m 2 /s), D 0 is the constant equivalent to the diffusivity at infinitely high temperature (m 2 /s), E a is the activation energy (kJ/mol), R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol K)), and T is the absolute temperature (K). The activation energy ( E a ) and the constant ( D 0 ) could be determined by plotting ln( D eff ) versus 1/ T after linearization for Eq. (8) . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Drying kinetics of chopped stalk The initial moisture content (d.b) of the chopped sweet sorghum stalk was 3.71 \u00b1 0.13 (mean \u00b1 SD). The experimental data (moisture content vs. time) in drying process were shown in Fig. 1 . As expected, the drying temperature had a significant effect on the drying rate of the samples. The moisture content decreased continuously with time and an increase in temperature resulted in the reduction of total drying time. The longest and shortest drying time were recorded at 24 h (30 \u00b0C) and 10 h (70 \u00b0C), respectively. According to a previous work ( Shen and Liu, 2009 ), the safe moisture content (d.b.) for sweet sorghum stalk storage was lower than 0.28. Thus, the actual drying time to reach the safe moisture content could be determined at 16 h, 9.5 h, 7 h, 5.5 h, and 4.5 h when the temperature was set at 30 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C 60 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C. Additionally, the temperature also drastically affected the equilibrium moisture. The equilibrium moisture contents were determined to be 0.109, 0.044, 0.035, 0.025 and 0.022, respectively, with the increasing of temperature from 30 \u00b0C to 70 \u00b0C. According to the presented data, the drying kinetics using various classical models were investigated. The statistical results were listed in Table 2 . According to the values of R 2 in different models at various temperature, it could be found the R 2 in Model 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 at various drying temperature were all higher than 0.99 except Model 2 and Model 6 in 30 \u00b0C. The results indicated that the mentioned 5 possible models could fit the experimental data well. In addition, For Model 2 and 6, the R 2 values at 30 \u00b0C were lower than 0.99, but it increased with the drying temperature. This meant that Model 2 and Model 6 were more suitable to describe the process in high drying temperature zone. Based on the mean value of statistical parameters (MSP) of these 5 models at various temperatures, the highest MSP of R 2 and lowest \u03c7 2 and RMSE appeared in model 9, which indicated that the Wang and Singh's model was the best one to stimulate the experimental data. Hence, the Wang and Singh's model could be selected in the present work to predict the drying characteristics of chopped sweet sorghum stalk. To take into account the effects of drying temperature on the model parameters, namely a , b and c in Model 9, and attempting to generalize the model, a regression analysis was applied to set up the relationship between these parameters and the temperature. The regression equations of these parameters against drying temperature (K) for each experimental condition were presented in Table 3 . The relationship between parameter of \u201c a \u201d and temperature ( T ) could be described using a cubic polynomial with correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) of 0.9335. The parameters of \u201c b \u201d and \u201c c \u201d could relate with drying temperature ( T ) using the linear regression with the R 2 of 0.9902 and 0.9913, respectively. In order to check the validation of the generalized model, the comparison of experimental moisture ratio values and the predicted values at various particular drying temperatures was carried out. Results showed that these experimental values laid near the straight lines (shown in Fig. 2 ), which suggested that the generalized model was valid at drying temperatures of 30\u201370 \u00b0C for drying sweet sorghum stalk. The effective diffusivity could be determined after the linearization\u00a0of Eq. (6) in the form of Eq. (7) . According to the regression between the experimental ln MR in falling rate period and the corresponding time ( s ), the effective diffusivities ( D eff ) were 7.20 \u00d7 10 \u22129 m 2 /s, 9.95 \u00d7 10 \u22129 m 2 /s, 1.33 \u00d7 10 \u22128 m 2 /s, 1.76 \u00d7 10 \u22128 m 2 /s and 1.91 \u00d7 10 \u22128 m 2 /s at the temperatures of 30 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, 60 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C, respectively. It could be obviously found the D eff s increased as the temperature increased. These D eff s were all in a reasonable range compared with the thin-layer drying of sugarcane bagasse ( Mazutti et al., 2010; Vijayaraj et al., 2007 ). The logarithm of D eff as a function of the reciprocal of absolute temperature was plotted in Fig. 3 . The results showed a linear relationship between (ln D eff ) and (1/ T ), leading to an Arrhenius-type relationship between the diffusion coefficient and temperature. According to Fig. 3 , the R 2 for the regression was 0.9779. Thereby, the diffusivity constant D 0 could be calculated as 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 m 2 /s. The active energy ( E a ) for moisture diffusion in drying the chopped stalk also could be estimated as 21.4 kJ/(mol K). The E a value was higher than some typical agricultural residues such as corn stalk, rice straw ( Cai and Chen, 2008 ), and lower than that of the apple slices, red chillies and salak ( Aghbashlo et al., 2010; Kaleemullah and Kailappan, 2006; Ong and Law, 2009 ). However, the E a of sweet sorghum stalk closed to that of sugarcane bagasse with a little higher ( Vijayaraj et al., 2007 ). The main reasons were probably due to the difference of their constructions and the initial moisture contents of these materials. For example, activation energy for sample (salak) with surface membrane was found higher than those without surface membrane and further resisted the moisture movement ( Ong and Law, 2009 ). 3.2 Effects of drying temperature on the qualities of chopped stalk The total sugar in sweet sorghum stalk mainly included sucrose, glucose and fructose, in which glucose and fructose were generally regarded as the reducing sugar. The purpose for drying sweet sorghum stalk was to prolong the storage and preserve more sugar. Therefore, the sugar composition changes at various drying temperature were necessary to be investigated. According to Fig. 4 , the total sugar loss actually happened in all groups after drying compared with the fresh stalk. The degree of total sugar loss was obviously reduced when the drying temperature increased from 30 \u00b0C to 70 \u00b0C. For the sucrose, it decreased slightly in 30 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C, and then decreased significantly when the temperature was enhanced from 50 \u00b0C to 70 \u00b0C. On the contrary, the reducing sugar at different drying temperatures slightly increased from 30 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C, and significantly increased from 50 \u00b0C to 70 \u00b0C. According to the results, it could be deduced that the possible reasons for sugar loss might mainly be from two aspects. The first aspect was the sugar consumption by microorganisms when the drying temperature was lower than 40 \u00b0C. Because the drying temperature of 30\u201340 \u00b0C was a suitable range for the growth of most microorganisms. The other aspect was the sugar degradation by browning reaction, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic browning. As shown in Fig. 5 , the browning reaction could happen in 30 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C. Moreover, the higher temperature was applied for drying, the more serious browning reaction could happen. Generally, the enzymatic browning always seriously happened in temperature lower than 40 \u00b0C. Once the drying temperature was higher than 40 \u00b0C, the non-enzymatic browning will occur heavily with temperature increase. Consequently, the total sugar loss in low temperature range was thereby more serious than high temperature, because the co-action of microorganisms\u2019 consumption and browning reaction. Most microorganisms could not grow when the temperature was higher than 50 \u00b0C, and the enzymatic browning also could be weakened. Thus, the sugar loss in high temperature mainly came from non-enzymatic browning reaction. Additionally, the hydrolysis of sucrose into the reducing sugar could also be occurred during the drying process ( Shen and Liu, 2010 ). Moreover, the hydrolysis could be accelerated with the increasing of temperature. Hence, the reducing sugar in drying process was in a trend of increase as the temperature increased from 50 \u00b0C to 70 \u00b0C, and sucrose was in a trend of decrease with increasing temperature. 3.3 Effects of drying temperature on the fermentability of the dried stalk The ethanol production was the final purpose to the storage of sweet sorghum stalk in drying way. The dried stalk was sequentially fermented after rehydration to investigate their fermentability. The results were presented in Fig. 6 . 58.5% of ethanol yield in the fresh stalk could be obtained after 48 h fermentation. It was unexpected that ethanol yield in the fresh stalk was lower than any groups of the rehydrated dry stalk. Moreover, The ethanol yield increased slightly from 65.5% to 73.3% when the drying temperature increased from 30 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C. Afterward, it dropped to 70.6% when the drying temperature increased to 70 \u00b0C. The dried stalk obtained at 60 \u00b0C had the highest ethanol yield. According to these results, it could be found that the dried sweet sorghum had a better fermentability after rehydration in contrast to fresh stalk. In previous studies, it was showed that the drying temperature would result in the losses of cell wall materials of kiwifruit, including pectin and hemicellulose, in the temperature range of 30\u201390 \u00b0C ( Femenia et al., 2009 ). Moreover, the amorphous cellulose could be partly rearranged or degraded in much higher temperature ( Sik et al., 2010 ). These indicated that the drying temperature could destroy the cell wall structure in a degree, which would be beneficial for the solubilization and diffusion of the sugar inside cell to the surface, and further improve the accessibility of sugars to yeast. Therefore, the ethanol yield of the rehydrated stalk could be higher than the fresh one. In addition, the drying temperature could reduce the hygroscopicity of lignocellulosic materials ( Sik et al., 2010 ). Thus, some free water could be observed around the substrate after suitable amount water was supplemented for rehydration to achieve the same water content with fresh stalk. Moreover, the higher temperature was applied for drying, the more free water could be observed after the rehydration. The existence of free water in solid state fermentation might be beneficial to the sugar/nutrition materials transportation from substrate to yeast cell and the ethanol transportation from yeast cell ( Shen and Liu, 2009 ). However, for the fresh stalk, there was no free water in the fermentation system. Therefore, the existence of free water could be a reason for a higher fermentability in rehydrated substrate. Additionally, based on the results in Fig. 5 , the browning degree was increased by the drying temperature, which could probably result in the formation of some potential inhibitors. This might be the reason for the ethanol yield decreased slightly when the dried stalk obtained at 70 \u00b0C was used for fermentation. As discussed above, the higher temperature could be beneficial to reduce the total sugar loss, but the excessive high temperature will bring the potential risk of the fermentation inhibition resulting in the decrease of ethanol yield. Hence, the suitable drying temperature could be selected as 50\u201360 \u00b0C. In this temperature range, the moisture content (d.b.) of fresh sweet sorghum could drop below 0.28, which was thought as the safe moisture for sweet sorghum storage, in 7\u20135.5 h with 12.1\u20139.7% total sugar loss during the drying process. 4 Conclusions Nine models were simulated to determine the approximate one for the drying process description. Meanwhile, the qualities, including sugar composition and the fermentability, were also investigated at different drying temperatures. The results showed that the Wang and Singh's model was the best one to describe the drying process of the chopped sweet sorghum stalk. The diffusivity constant ( D 0 ) and active energy ( E a ) could be, respectively, estimated as 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 m 2 /s and 21.4 kJ/(mol K) for drying the chopped sweet sorghum stalk. Combining the analysis of qualities, the approximate drying temperature could be suggested as 50\u201360 \u00b0C for the application.

        "title": "Evaluating the interplays among economic growth and energy consumption and CO2 emission of China during 1990-2007",
        "abstract": "The interplays among economy and energy and environment have been widely concerned. This paper put forward several indicators to quantify the relationships among economic growth and energy consumption and CO2 emission. As an example, these indicators were applied to evaluate the comprehensive performances of China during 1990-2007. The results show that Chinese people has been living a better life with Chinese rapid economic growth but not synchronously in urban and rural areas. Non-carbon energy resources share has increased; however, fossil energy resources have still acted as the main driver for Chinese economic growth during this period. Technical progress has improved the fossil energy efficiency of Chinese economic activity, which leads to CO2 emission per unit GDP and CO2 emission per capita unit GDP dropping simultaneously; however, the two indicators' annual decline rates become smaller and smaller, which reflects that technical progress' role is dropping and economic scale's effect is climbing. People's survival has a rising contribution to CO2 emission. CO2 emission per capita has increased, which shows that economic scale has greater impact on CO2 emission than technical progress does. Relatively speaking, Chinese development patterns have become more and more sustainable during this period. Finally, based on the related issues being discussed, some corresponding suggestions are put forward for Chinese government to further coordinate the relationship among economic development and energy consumption and CO2 emission. The proposed indicators can form a set of useful tool for policy-makers to promote the harmonious development of economy and energy and environment in different regions and countries. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "The effects of activated carbon fibers (ACF0, ACFH, and ACFN) on the degradation of methyl orange were investigated in a pulsed discharge reactor. ACF0 fibers were modified with nitric acid (to yield ACFH fibers) or ammonia (to yield ACFN fibers) to create fibers with different porous structures and chemical properties. The adsorption properties of ACF0, ACFH, and ACFN depended on their pore diameter, but the catalytic properties were independent of their chemical properties. Acidic and basic surfaces both accelerated ozone decomposition, resulting in formation of hydroxyl radicals. Boehm titration and Fourier-transform infrared spectral studies indicated that the numbers of acidic and basic groups on ACF0, ACFH, and ACFN surfaces could be increased by this process, as could the surface areas and pores volumes. ACF0, ACFH, and ACFN could also be regenerated in situ after repeated use.",

        "abstract": "Biochar can affect the phosphorus (P) cycle in the rice ecosystem through various pathways. Pot experiments were conducted to investigate the risk of P contamination and the P supply rate to crops with the application of maize straw-derived biochar (BM) and P fertilizer. The biochar increased 18.3% and 8.45% total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the low-P level and high-P level soils, respectively. The addition of biochar increased the phosphorus activation coefficient (PAC) by 9.00% at low-P levels, while the PAC was reduced by 10.4% at high-P levels. The results suggested that biochar could serve as either a source or a sink for P. The P concentration in the dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) extracts on the root surfaces in biochar-treated soils increased by 467.1% and 46.1% in the low-P level and high-P level soils, respectively. It may cause by the acidification of soils near the root and the increase in Fe plaque. The results also showed the addition of biochar increased the DCB-P concentration and subsequently promoted rice growth. The biochar additions enhanced bacterial community richness and diversity, while the P supplementations inhibited bacterial growth. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that available nitrogen (AN), Fe-P, Ca-P, P uptake and, DCB extracted Fe (DCB-Fe) were significantly correlated with microbial community composition and explained 46.8%, 37.1%, 38.0%, 37.5% and 36.7% of the total community variability, respectively. This study provided evidence that biochar might affect the P cycle by impacting the microbial community composition and the Fe-reducing processes in the rice ecosystem.",

During its construction and operation, ISTS has two main impacts on the environment, i.e., the consumption of resources and the damage of discharged pollutants on the environment, while the latter was usually ignored by the previous researchers when they assessed the impacts of wastewater treatment system. In order to more comprehensively understanding the impacts of sewage treatment on the environment, an analysis was made on the ISTS based on the theories of emergy analysis, and, in combining with ecological footprint theory, the sustainability of the ISTS was also analyzed. The results showed that the emergy of the impacts of water pollutants on the environment was far larger than that of the impacts of air pollutants, and NH3-N was the main responsible cause. The emergy consumption of ISTS mainly came from the emergy of wastewater and of local renewable resources. The \"sewage treatment plant system + landfill system\" had the highest emergy utilization efficiency, while the \"sewage treatment plant system + reclaimed water reuse system + incineration system\" had the lowest one. From the aspect of environmental sustainability, the \"sewage treatment plant system + reclaimed water reuse system + landfill system\" was the best ISTS, while the \"sewage treatment plant system + incineration system\" was the worst one.",

        "abstract": "The pressure arising from continuous increase in productivity on the ambient environment and the concomitant pollution threat call for integrated and more efficient environmental protection systems. Sewage treatment systems are technological means to handle the pollution resulting from the production activities, and environmental sustainability and economic viability are two important assessment parameters. Based on the traditional emergy analysis indicators (emergy yield ratio EYR, environmental loading ratio ELR, environmental sustainability index ESI and emergy benefit ratio EBR), the improved emergy indices (SEYR, SELR, SESI and SEBR, respectively) were proposed for assessing two integrated sewage treatment systems after considering effects of the waste and the product in this study. In addition, three economic evaluation indicators (the net income NI, the profitability ratio PR and economic investment ratio per unit sewage IR) were also exploited to evaluate and compare two constructed integrated sewage treatment systems (i. e., 'sewage treatment plant +dewatered sludge landfilling ' and 'sewage treatment plant +reclaimed water reuse + dewatered sludge landfilling '). Emergy evaluation and economic analysis are complementary approaches, with emergy evaluation focusing on the environmental support and effects of a production system while economic analysis method paying more attention to the market value of the products. Hence, a combination of them allows to gain a better understanding of overall performance of a sewage treatment ecosystem in terms of both environment and economy. The systems considered here were integrated with livestock sewage treatment systems, as the systems not only included the sewage treatment plant, but also were composed of treated water and dewatered sludge disposal options. This may give a whole picture of the ecological economic performance of the treatment of livestock sewage. The results showed that, system 2 ('sewage treatment plant+reclaimed water reuse+ dewatered sludge landfilling ') has a much greater environmental sustainability index than system 1 ('sewage treatment plant+dewatered sludge landfilling ') suggesting the former is much more sustainable, and that incorporation of a reclaimed water reuse system is a valuable way for promoting the sustainability of a sewage treatment system since the reuse system of reclaimed water not only produced new water resources from reclaimed water but also saved the cost for discharging treated water which is charged according to the relative regulations. System 2 is less competitive than system 1 as NI of system 1 is higher (2. 4620\u00d7106 Yuan/ a), PR and IR of system 1 are 1. 38 and 0. 72 times of system 2, respectively. System 2 is a more environmentally benign system, however, it's not competitive in terms of economy. Thus, economic policy supports should be made available for popularization of system 2 which may include charge for direct waste discharge of untreated or insufficiently treated sewage, and economic compensation for reclaimed water reuse.",

Recently, using biomarkers to monitor the effects of pollutants has attracted increased interest. Pot culture experiments using radish (Raphanus sativus L.) was performed to investigate Cu phytotoxic effects on antioxidant enzymes and other early warning biomarkers of soil Cu exposure. Under low dose Cu stress (lower than the EC10, Cu concentration reducing root length by 10%), activity and isozyme expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidases (POD) increased significantly; no significant variations in chlorophyll, carotenoid, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in leaves and toxic symptoms were observed. Under a slightly higher Cu stress (close to the EC10), activity and isozyme expression of SOD and MDA content were enhanced significantly; those of CAT and POD decreased due to an inverted U-shape dose response. Chlorophyll content remained unchanged. Thus, antioxidant enzymes and MDA content are more sensitive to Cu stress, showing significant variations ahead of chlorophyll and toxic symptoms under Cu stress (lower than about 200 mg kg(-1) soil). Thus, the joint monitoring of antioxidant enzymes and MDA content of R. sativus can be used as biomarkers of soil Cu contamination.",

        "abstract": "In order to reduce the cost of ethanol production from sweet sorghum, ethanol fermentation with condensed sweet sorghum juice accompanying with superoxide dismutase (SOD) production was carried out with the very high gravity (VGH) technology in this work. The effects of initial sugar concentration, yeast inoculation, inorganic N, P nutrients, metal ions and vitamins on ethanol yield and SOD production were investigated. The results indicated that the SOD production of 2.99\u00d7104 U\u00b7 L-1 could be achieved with the condensed juice (initial sugar concentration of 350 g\u00b7L-1 comparing with fresh juice (0.68\u00d7104 U\u00b7L-1), although approximately 6% of ethanol yield was lost. Extra high yeast inoculation could not improve ethanol yield and SOD production, and 0.25 g\u00b7L-1 yeast should be enough for VHG fermentation. For application, the compromised supplementation for (NH4) 2SO4, KH2 PO4, Zn(AC)2, CuSO4, thiamine and inositol could be selected at 1.0 g\u00b7L -1, 3.0 g \u00b7L-1, 0 mg\u00b7L-1, 7.5 mg\u00b7L-1, 100 mg\u00b7L-1 and 75 mg\u00b7L -1, respectively, for fermentation with 350 g\u00b7L-1 initial sugar concentration. At their corresponding supplementations, ethanol yield and SOD production could be obtained in the ranges of 0.38 g\u00b7g -1-0.41 g\u00b7g-1 and 1.23\u00d7104-3. 82\u00d7104 U\u00b7L-1, respectively. \u00a9 2012 American Scientific Publishers.",

        "abstract": "China has become the largest generator of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the world with its rapid urbanization, population growth and raising living standard. Among diverse solid waste disposal technologies, MSW incineration has been becoming an attractive choice. In terms of systematic point, an integrated MSW incineration system should include an incineration subsystem and a bottom ash (BA) disposal subsystem. This paper employed an extend emergy assessment method with several improved indicators, which considers the emissions' impact, to evaluate the comprehensive performances of an integrated MSW incineration system. One existing incineration plant in Yibin City, Sichuan Province, China, as a case study, is evaluated using the proposed method. Three alternative scenarios (scenario A: the incineration subsystem\u202f+\u202fthe BA landfill subsystem; scenario B: the incineration subsystem\u202f+\u202fthe concrete paving brick production subsystem using BA as raw material; scenario C: the incineration subsystem\u202f+\u202fthe non-burnt wall brick production subsystem using BA as raw material) were compared. The study results reveal that the ratio of positive output is 1.225, 2.861 and 1.230, the improved environmental loading ratio is 2.715, 2.742 and 1.533, and the improved environmental sustainability index is 0.451, 1.043 and 0.803 for scenario A, B and C respectively. Therefore, reuse of BA can enhance the sustainability level of this integrated system greatly. Comparatively, scenario B has the best comprehensive performance among the three scenarios. Finally, some targeted recommendations are put forward for decision-making.",

However, how to define and how to assess ecological civilization ( EC ) are worth further exploring. This paper constructed a people-oriented  EC  indicator system, composed of a set of indicators, viz. Degree of Physiological Equilibrium ( DPE ), Degree of Psychological Imbalance ( DPI ), Degree of Imbalance of Human and Environment ( DIHE ), Degree of Human Development ( DHP ), Disharmony Degree of Economy and Environment ( DDEE ), and a composite index-Ecological Civilization Index (ECI), and then the indicator system was used to investigate the trends of China\u2019s  EC  construction during 1980\u20132010. Based on the reference year 1980, the study revealed that: (1) Physiological equilibrium of Chinese people has been slightly disturbed; (2) Psychological balance of Chinese people has been broken seriously; (3) The balance between human and environment has been destroyed greatly; (4) China has achieved great progress in promoting human development; (5) this country has improved the relationship between economy and environment obviously, despite that this improvement pace still falls behind speed of economic growth; and (6) China\u2019s  EC  level has declined during this study period. Therein, psychological problem and conflict between human and environment are the key obstacles to China\u2019s  EC  progress. China\u2019s government should further emphasize reform of its income distribution system and transformation of its economic development mode in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Chinau0027s industrial parks have made great contributions to its economic growth with their rapid development. However, the resources and environment related issues have been challenging their sustainability to different degree. There still exist the following challenges in evaluating the sustainability of industrial systems due to the existing researches ignoring one or more related issues, including (1) ignorance of ecosystemu0027s contributions to industrial activities, (2) neglect of quality differences between different resources, energies and labors, (3) involving subjectivity of human, (4) inadequate consideration of emissionsu0027 impact, and (5) lacking consideration on recycling and reuse benefit derived from industrial symbiosis. Therefore, they are isolated to some degree and lack completeness and systematization. This study aimed to deal with the five issues by adopting classic EA (emergy analysis) method (Overcoming issues 1\u20133.), quantifying emissionsu0027 impact in terms of emergy with some modified parameters (Addressing issue 4.) and proposing indicators to evaluating recycling and reuse benefit (Focusing on issue 5.). Then one proposed emergy method and the related indicator system for assessing the sustainability of industrial parks were set up. Next, an industrial park in Sichuan, China, as a case, was research using the proposed method and indicator system. The study results show that, according to the classic emergy based indicators, this industrial park has relatively high economic competition ability (EYR\u00a0=\u00a01.14), relatively low environmental press (ELR\u00a0=\u00a029.31), and relatively strong sustainability (ESI\u00a0=\u00a00.0388) compared to other industrial parks in China. However, its low economic efficiency and low wastes recycling/reuse degree still seriously challenge its sustainability with the local mineral resources exhaustion in the future. In terms of modified emergy indicators, emissionsu0027 impact further raises its environmental load by 3.42% and reduces its sustainability level by 2.70%. Finally, some corresponding suggestions are put forward.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Flue gas denitration systems play an important role in reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. However, their potential resource efficiency, environmental impacts and economic performance should be emphasized. It is necessary to assess their effects from pros and cons so as to reflect their relatively sustainable levels more completely. Since emergy analysis (EmA) considers quality differences among diverse categories of energy, materials and money, as well as the environmental contribution to economic activities, this work put forward an emergy-based combined approach and related indicators, which consider pollution emissionsu0027 impacts, for evaluating flue gas denitration systems comprehensively. Next, two flue gas denitration systems in China (the selective catalytic reduction denitration system (SCRDS) and the selective non-catalytic reduction denitration system (SNCRDS)), as study cases, were investigated using the proposed approach and indicators. It is found that (1) purchased nonrenewable input (NP) contributes most to their total emergy input (TE); (2) the emergy loss is main emissions\u2019 impact; (3) the SNCRDS has higher environmental cost but lower economic cost than the SCRDS due to its smaller share of purchased input and lower treatment efficiency; (4) the SCRDS has much higher environmental loading than the SNCRDS due to its higher share of nonrenewable input; (5) the SNCRDS has higher sustainability level than the SCRDS due to its lower dependence on nonrenewable input. Generally the denitration technologies convert lots of purchased nonrenewable resources into the local environmental benefits in an unsustainable way, which could cause the depletion of nonrenewable resources and environmental emissions in other areas in the future. Finally, some suggestions are proposed, including replacing the reducing agent for the SNCRDS, promoting the regeneration of spent denitration catalysts, strengthening energy management, and emphasizing operation training of technical staff.",

Sludge treatment and disposal technologies need economical investment and resource consumption, and their comprehensive performance should be investigated from pros and cons, to provide systematic information for policy-makers. Based on the characteristics of sludge treatment and/or disposal systems, this study proposed an improved emergy approach which considered emissions\u2019 impact, and then it presented a set of indicator system to explore the comprehensive performance of sewage treatment/disposal practice. Application of the proposed method and indictors to one sewage sludge treatment system with earthworm compositing technology located in Chengdu, China results show that (1) the dewatered sludge is the main contributor to this system, followed by mushroom dregs; (2) direct emissions from diesel use should be emphasized; (3) this system can promote resource conservation effectively through lower emergy investment; (4) emissions\u2019 impact slightly reduces the comprehensive performance; (5) this system is not sustainable in the long term due to great dependence on nonrenewable resources. Finally, this work puts forward some improvement suggestions for the sewage sludge treatment practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   CISS (Chinese iron and steel sector) plays an important role in Chinese economic development. As one of energy-intensive and high pollution industries, China\u2019s government has taken a serial of measures to improve its performances in recent years. How about the environmental sustainability of CISS under the intervention of these measures? However, few studies have explored CISS\u2019s trends of environmental sustainability using a systematic method based on a time series analysis in recent years. To this end, this study investigates the trends of environmental sustainability of this sector during the 2005\u20132015 periods using an emergy-based integrated approach. Different from other evaluation methods, the proposed approach can reveal the resources\u2019 structure, reflect the production efficiency, describe the environmental loading and show the sustainability level by considering the environmental and human contributions as well as the environmental emissions\u2019 impacts. By doing so, this work provides more complete and comprehensive information. The research results show that (1) iron ore contributes about 55% to the input of CISS; (2) on the average, water pollutants (mainly volatile phenol and NH 4  + -N) contribute 99.86% to extra environmental loading; (3) air emissions (mainly dust and CO 2 ) contribute 99.63% to the total potential environmental cost; (4) this sector has a slightly decreasing economic benefit, and the emissions\u2019 impacts weaken this indicator by 0.94\u20132.08%; and (5) CISS has an ascending environmental loading, and environmental emissions increase the environmental loading by 6.39\u201399.80%. Generally, the CISS\u2019s sustainability level decreases by 31.49%, which is weaken by 6.39\u201399.80% due to environmental emissions. Finally, the related policy suggestions are proposed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As one of important building materials, the sustainability of cement production is widely concerned in the world. This research evaluated the sustainability of China\u2019s cement industry in 2010 using emergy analysis. Several emergy based indicators were adopted to describe the comprehensive performance of this system from different angles, including Percentage of renewability (%R), Unit emergy value (UEV), Emergy yield ratio (EYR), Emergy exchange ratio (EER), Environmental load ratio (ELR) and Emergy sustainable index (ESI). The research results show that (1) Mineral resources have absolute contribution to China\u2019s cement production; (2) Coal is the main energy source for China\u2019s cement industry; (3) China\u2019s cement industry has relatively weak competition ability due to relatively high ratio of purchased inputs; (4) China\u2019s other industries have benefited greatly from this industry by exchanges; (5) China\u2019s cement industry cannot keep sustainable in the long run due to its high environmental load; (6) the UEV of Chinese cement in 2010 is 3.64E15 sej/t (based on the emergy baseline 15.83E24 sej/yr). Finally, the related policy implications are proposed from four aspects, including (1) Accelerating the adjustment of process structure and technical innovation; (2) Promoting the substitution of raw materials or fuels; (3) Raising the price of cement products; (4) Decreasing the export of cement products.",

        "abstract": "In this study, grey relational analysis (GRA) was used to investigate the effects of different application rates of wine lees-derived biochar on a plant-soil system with multi-metal contamination. A pot experiment was conducted to determine rice growth in multi-metal-contaminated soil amended with samples of wine lees-derived biochar, and 47 indicators (including soil properties, microbial activity, and plant physiology) were selected as evaluation indexes to assess the plant-soil system. The results indicated that higher wine lees-derived biochar application rates (2% W/W) were favorable for soil fertility, the bioconcentration factor (BF), and the mobility factor (MF, %) (with the exception of Cr, Zn, and Hg), but an application of 1% produced the highest plant growth, enzymatic activities, and bacterial diversity. The richness of the bacterial communities was reduced in the soil amended with the wine lees-derived biochar. According to the GRA assessment, the 1% application rate of wine lees-derived biochar was more suitable for restoring the holistic plant-soil system than were the application rates of 0, 0.5, and 2% (W/W). Furthermore, this study shows that GRA is a useful method for evaluating plant-soil systems.",

        "title": "Shifts in the relative abundance of bacteria after wine-lees-derived biochar intervention in multi metal-contaminated paddy soil.",
        "abstract": "The impact of biochar application on soil ecological functions depends on the diversity of soil conditions and of the feedstocks from which biochar is obtained. Moreover, little information is available on the effect of biochar on dynamic changes in microorganisms with the development of rice plants in multi-metal-contaminated paddy soil amended with wine-lees-derived biochar. In this paper, biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of wine lees at 600\u00b0C was used to investigate the potential role of biochar in maintaining soil ecological functions, with consideration of the alteration of the microbial population over periods of rice growth. Biochar increased the soil nutrient availability, suppressed the toxicity of heavy metals and benefited the rice growth. Enzymic activities initially increased and then decreased with increasing biochar addition as well as with the growth stage. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that biochar application shifted the soil microbial community, increased the bacterial diversity and reduced the bacterial richness. The relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes and Cyanobacteria increased with increasing biochar addition, whereas the abundance of Gemmatimonadetes decreased at higher biochar applications. With increasing biochar application, Nitrospirae, which were lowest in the 1% biochar addition treatment, first decreased and then increased. The results from this study indicated that biochar addition increased N fixation and improved C cycling. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that RI (potential ecological risk index), AN (available nitrogen) and AP (available phosphorus) were the most important factors for bacteria and accounted for 68.7%, 58.3% and 52.4% of the variation, respectively. Therefore, the reduction of metal toxicity and the improvement of soil fertility are important mechanisms for higher bacterial abundances.",

Specifically, the adsorption isotherm and kinetics of Pb(2+) onto wine lees-derived biochar were examined. Experimental results revealed that wine lees-derived biochar featured large specific surface area and total pore volume, and high contents of -COOH and -OH on its surface. Adsorption of Pb(2+) onto wine lees-derived biochar proceeded via a multilayer adsorption mechanism, as described by the Freundlich adsorption model. Adsorption kinetics followed the Lagergren pseudo-second-order kinetics model; adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 30-60\u00a0min. Furthermore, the effect of solution pH on the adsorption of Pb(2+) was investigated. Within the studied pH range of 3-6, the adsorption capacity increased with increasing pH. Under established optimized conditions, wine lees-derived biochar achieved a Pb(2+) adsorption capacity of 79.12\u00a0mg/g. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A narrow-gap TiO 2  nanofiber film was synthesized on Ti foil by chemical polishing and anodization. The morphology, crystal structure, chemical states, and optical properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photon electron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible-infrared absorption spectroscopy, respectively. Transient photocurrent response, linear sweep voltammetry, and photoconversion efficiency were also measured. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated from both hydrogen generation and methyl orange degradation experiments. Our results suggested that the film was composed of small uniform TiO 2  nanofibers, having interstitial nitrogen-doping, oxygen vacancies and a mixture of anatase and rutile crystal phases. The films exhibited strong and broad optical absorption from 200 to 2500\u00a0nm. Owing to this strong absorption and rapid transport of photogenerated electrons, the nanofiber films exhibited a high photoconversion efficiency of 0.62%, and a hydrogen generation rate of 0.62\u00a0mL\u00a0h \u22121 \u00a0cm \u22122  under visible light irradiation. Under solar irradiation the films also showed remarkable efficiency and stability for the degradation of methyl orange.",

The results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the reduction degree of graphene products increased with the increase in the volume ratio of DMAc and water (V DMAc /V H2O ), and kept constant when the V DMAc /V H2O  ratio was equal or greater than 1. A reduction mechanism from graphite oxide to graphene was proposed. The epoxy groups and hydroxyl on the graphite oxide (GO) surface could be eliminated in the reduction process, whereas the carbonyl was converted to a hydroquinone structure.",

However, it usually takes a few hours to obtain the right nanostructures even on a small scale (e.g., 10 mm \u00d7 20 mm). In order to attract interest for industrial applications, fast and large-scale fabrication is highly desirable. Herein, we demonstrate a fast and large-scale (e.g., 300 mm \u00d7 360 mm) synthesis of pine-cone TiO2 nanostructures within two min. The formation mechanism of pine-cone TiO2 is proposed. The pine-cone TiO2 possesses a strong solar absorption, and exhibits high photocatalytic activities in photo-oxidizing organic pollutants in wastewater and producing hydrogen from water under natural sunlight. Thus, this study demonstrates a promising method for fabricating TiO2 films towards practical photocatalytic applications.",

        "abstract": "To effectively remove Cd from water, biochars were produced by pyrolyzing surplus agricultural wastes of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) at 300, 500, and 700\u00a0\u00b0C. The biochars were characterized, and their Cd(II) removal ratios and adsorption capacities in aqueous solutions were evaluated. The physical and chemical properties of the biochars were significantly affected by increasing the pyrolysis temperature; the data indicated that the ash content, pH and specific surface area of the biochars increased, whereas the yield and contents of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen decreased. In addition, the molar ratios of H/C, O/C and (O + N)/C decreased, which implied that the biochars became more aromatic and carbonaceous with a lower polarity and fewer oxygen-based functional groups. The pseudo-second-order kinetics model and Langmuir and Temkin isotherm models described the Cd(II) adsorption better than the other tested models. The biochars derived at higher pyrolysis temperatures had higher adsorption capacities, and the maximum adsorption capacities for PC700 and SC700 were 71.49 and 46.87 mg g\u22121, respectively. The Qm values in our study were equivalent to or even higher than those for other modified biochars. This result shows that the biochars in this study are effective adsorbents for Cd(II) removal from wastewater.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus loss from agricultural soils is an important cause of eutrophication. The diversity of soil conditions and biochar\u00a0feedstocks induces various\u00a0effects on P retention after biochar application. Here, the\u00a0effect of biochars at three application rates (0/1/5%, w/w) on P sorption and desorption in paddy soil with two levels of P application, 0 and 60\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121, were evaluated. Results show a\u00a0notable reduction\u00a0of the\u00a0phosphorus activation coefficient\u00a0(PAC, AP (available P)/TP (total P)) with biochar addition, thus\u00a0suppressing the risk of\u00a0P\u00a0loss by the formation of Ca\u2013P and Fe\u2013P. The Langmuir sorption maximum (Qm) increased by 20.7\u201321.6%, 18.5\u201340.6% and 14.1\u201331.2% in amendments of biochar obtained from pig manure, corn straw and pine, respectively. The P sorption index\u00a0(PSI) and maximum buffer capacity\u00a0(MBC) in soils with biochar obtained from different feedstocks ranged in order from pig manure\u2009>\u2009corn straw\u2009>\u2009pine. Pig manure biochar had no significant effect on P retention due to changes in Ca/Mg/P by adjusting the pH, electronegativity and P content, resulting in anion repulsion. However, pine-derived biochar was favorable for the accumulation of thermally stable carbon dominated by aromatic carbon as well as lower alkalinity, promoting P sorption and suppressing P availability, especially at low P levels. In this study, we show that adding woody biochar to soil can simultaneously suppress nonpoint source pollution and reduce P fertilizer inputs.",

Biochar application is an effective way to remove toxic metals due to its high efficiency and low price. Electrostatic adsorption is the primary adsorption mechanism. The absorption ability and stability of biochar is the key to its adsorption performance. The extent of the restoration efficiency is dependent on many factors. The biomass, pyrolysis temperature and application rate affect the number of binding sites. The ageing process and soil properties significantly affect the biochar stability. For long-term purposes, biochar derived from woody residues and pyrolysed at high temperatures is the best available material. In addition, the application of alkaline and electronegative biochar to clay-rich, acidic and As- or Cr-contaminated soil should to be treated with caution.",

In order to explore these applications, a pot experiment was carried out to research the effect of biochar on the heavy metal speciation in paddy soil and the heavy metal accumulation of paddy rice from Chengdu plain, Sichuan Province. The experimental results show that wine lees-derived biochar can efficiently increase soil pH, decrease the contents of soil exchangeable heavy metals, and promote heavy metal transformation to residual fraction. Moreover, application of biochar can reduce the accumulation of heavy metals in paddy plant, decrease the migration ability of heavy metals to the aboveground part of the plant, and consequently cut down contents of heavy metals in rice. When biochar dosage was 0.5\u00a0% in weight, the contents of soil exchangeable Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd decreased 18.8, 29.6, 26.3, 23.0, 23.01, and 48.14\u00a0%, respectively, which all significantly differed from CK (\u2009<\u20090.05), and the contents of heavy metals in plant roots, stems, leaves, rice husk, and rice all decreased accordingly, among which Zn, Cd, and Pb decreased 10.96, 8.89, and 8.33\u00a0% respectively. When biochar dosage increased to 1\u00a0%, heavy metal contents in roots, stems, leaves, rice husk, and rice decreased further. Therefore, wine lees-derived biochar shows a great potential in remediation of heavy-metal-polluted soil, and this work provides theoretical basis for restoring heavy-metal-polluted soil using biochar.",

Here, we investigated bacterial and archaeal community composition, diversity, association networks, and functional profiles in livestock and poultry breeding wastewater (LPBW) with C:N gradients from 7.8 to 18.9 using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Highest total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) removal rates were detected in the wastewater with high C:N ratios, while bacterial and archaeal communities in the wastewater varied across the four C:N ratios. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroides were generally the dominant phyla in the wastewater across treatments, with Candidatus Saccharibacteria being more enriched in the wastewater with high C:N ratios. Association network analysis showed that specific bacterial and archaeal taxa likely have similar metabolic activities allowing them to respond similarly to different C:N ratios. Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Candidatus Saccharibacteria, and Proteobacteria were the keystone species found in the networks. Most dominant bacterial functions in the wastewater were chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy. Nitrite respiration, nitrous oxide denitrification, nitrate denitrification and nitrite denitrification were up-regulated with increased C:N ratios. Our findings provide new insights into our understanding of the compositions, potential associations, and predicted functional profiles of the microbial community in LPBW treated with different C:N ratios.",

        "abstract": "Water supply systems have led to the related effects on goals of nation energy consumption, environmental protection and economic development due to their energy use, pollutants discharge and economic cost. This work put forward a set of indicator system and the related methods, based on energy, current, mass and emergy, to describe the complicated interactions between water supply systems, economic development, energy consumption and environmental impact. As a case, the proposed indicators and methods were used to explore the effects of Chinau0027s tap water supply system (TWSS) on national economy, energy and environment from 2000 to 2013, so as to discover some underlying obstacles hindering the sustainable development of Chinau0027s TWSS. The study results show that (1) per capita water use declines by 28.11% from 102.17 t/person in 2000 to 73.45 t/person in 2013; (2) the contribution of Chinau0027s TWSS to national economy and energy decreases by annual decline rates of 5.37% and 3.66% respectively; (3) the total pollution discharge from this system ascends by an annual growth rate of 1.06%, of which 97.44% comes from sludge discharge in terms of mass; therein, the contribution of COD discharge from this system to national COD discharge rises by an annual growth rate of 2.57% while the contribution of sludge discharge from this system to national sludge discharge falls by an annual decrease rate of 9.26%; generally the environmental impact intensity of this system ascends by an annual growth rate of 0.17%; (4) the annual average leakage rate of 16.49% leads to a lot of water waste. Therefore, Chinau0027s government will still face the two serious challenges derived from the rising water demand and the increasing energy consumption from tap water supply with development of its society and economy. After discussing the related issues, this work gives the corresponding policy suggestions.",

In this paper, a new soluble anthracene derivative 2-tert-butyl-9, 10-bis(9, 9-dipropylfluorenyl) anthracene (TBPFA) was designed and synthesized. The compound exhibited pure-blue-light emitting (\u03bbmax = 443 nm in dilute dichloromethane, \u03bbmax = 450 nm in solid film) and high fluorescence quantum efficiency. The none-doped and doped single-layer devices were prepared successfully by spin coating process with TBPFA as blue-light emitting material and blue-light emitting host material respectively. In the doped device, TBPFA can transport energies to TBPe which is a good blue-light emitting material efficiently.",

However, constructing a hierarchical structure on the outer shell of the products via the current microcapsule synthesis method is difficult. This work presents a novel approach to fabricating hollow microspheres with a hierarchical shell structure through the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process in which liquid indium droplets act as both templates for the formation of silica capsules and catalysts for the growth of hierarchical shell structure. This hierarchical shell structure offers the hollow microsphere an enhanced geometry-based adhesion. The results provide a facile method for fabricating hollow spheres and enriching their function through tailoring the geometry of their outer shells.",

A photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell employing a ZnTAPc modified SiNW array as photoanode was found to be able to effectively produce hydrogen at a rate of 13mol(cm 2h) 1 under 100mwcm 2 irradiation from a xenon lamp. It is believed that the loading of ZnTAPc can enhance the efficiency of hydrogen generation and the stability of the SiNW array. This demonstrates that the ZnTAPc modified SiNW is a promising material for solar hydrogen generation. \u00a9 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In the study of steady state fluorescence spectrum, it was seen clearly that the naphthyl groups on the particle surface were able to reorganize in different solvents. And in a certain condition the excimer fluorescence of naphthyl group may be observed evidently. The surface fluorescence quenching of particles by different transition cations was studied. It was found that only Cu 2+ cation showed itself very strong ability of quenching the surface fluorescence of studied particles. But for other metal cations almost no any quenching effect was observed. The excellent recognition of Cu2+ cation of this system provides a possibility to develop a new fluorescence sensor for Cu2+ cation detection.",

The approach exploits the directional supramolecular interaction induced by strong donor-acceptor dipole-dipole supramolecular interaction in the growth of 1-D nanostructures. By varying the process temperatures, the DAPMP nanostructures can be controllably prepared as either nanoribbons, nanotubes, or nanowires with high morphological and chemical purities.

        "abstract": "A new family of iridium(III) complexes featuring pinene groups and various alkoxy side chains were synthesized and characterized. The complexes show emission peaked at around 492 nm with the phosphorescence quantum yield of \u03a6 P = 0.4\u20130.6 and the emission lifetime of \u03c4 = 2\u20134 \u03bcs.

The device with new iridium(III) complex doping concentration of 3.2 wt.% exhibits a maximum luminance efficiency 19.9 cd/A (7.8 lm/W) at 9.1 V, CIE coordinates (0.21, 0.53), and a maximum luminance of 15,700 cd/m 2 at 8.4 V was observed. Keywords PLEDs Iridium complex Phosphorescent emitter Solution-processible 1 Introduction Recently, organic light-emitting diodes are under intensive studies because they are likely to play a potentially competitive role in full-color flat panel display [1,2] . Research on light-emitting diodes has focused on the improvement of the emission efficiency either by introducing highly efficient materials or on the design of novel device architectures. Moreover, solution processing for light-emitting diodes is under far more active research lately because it can be fabricated with low cost approach, especially for large-area full-color displays [3,4] . By employing phosphorescent dyes to harvest of both singlet and triplet states, high efficiency polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) have been realized. For example, platinum(II) and iridium(III) complexes such as 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-21H,23H-porphine platinum [PtOEP] and fac -tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium[Ir(ppy) 3 ] are often used to be doped in polymer matrix to achieved high efficiency PLEDs [5\u20137] . In our previous work, iridium complex such as tris(5-phenyl-10,10-dimethyl-4-aza-tricycloundeca-2,4,6-triene)iridium (Ir(pppy) 3 ) was synthesized by introducing pinene group as spacer to the framework of 2-phenylpyridine, and showed good EL performances when applied to small molecular organic light-emitting diodes [8,9] . One reason for the high performance observed in the Ir(pppy) 3 -doped diodes is that the complex has high steric hindrance such that it can be doped to a high concentration (e.g. up to 26%) with little concentration quenching. We also explored these advantages in PLEDs [10] . Single layer phosphorescent PLEDs using Ir(pppy) 3 -doped poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and 2-tert-butylphenyl-5-biphenenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol (PBD) blend as active organic layer were fabricated. These devices show good luminescent efficiencies and relatively low turn-on voltages. However, as doped concentration goes higher than 1.0 wt.%, the efficiency drops which possibly due to the concentration quench. Gong et al. have synthesized an iridium complex by modification with two alkyl substituents attached on the ligand and obtained high doped concentration in PVK [11] . Mishra et al. also reported that the solubility was enhanced by attaching side chains of alkoxy groups to the ligand and these derivatives could easily be spin-coated [12] , but the further exploration about iridium complex in the area is rare in recent years. In the present work, we report a new family of iridium(III) complexes (Ir(RO-pppy) 3 ) containing pinene group and alkoxy chain in the ligand, which hopes to improve compatibility with polymer host and further inhibit phase segregation in polymer matrix thus to reach higher doped concentration with less efficiency decrease. Their photophysical properties were studied and the EL performances were compared. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. or Acros Organics, the solvents were obtained from Beijing Chemical Works. All reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification except for glycerol, which was bubbled with dry argon for about 6 h and then was kept with size 3A molecular sieves under an inert atmosphere. 2.1.1 General procedure for synthesis of alkyloxy-acetophenone Into a 500 mL flask fitted with condenser, dropping funnel and argon inlet was flushed with argon and then charged with 4-hydroxyacetophenone (2.72 g, 20 mmol), anhydrous potassium carbonate (4.14 g, 30 mmol), potassium iodide (0.33 g, 2 mmol) and 180 mL anhydrous ethanol. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then alkyl bromide (30 mmol) in 20 mL anhydrous ethanol was added slowly and the mixture was heated to reflux for 3 h. A white precipitate appeared. The solution was then filtered while hot and washed with ether, the solvent was removed to leave a pale yellow solid. This solid was dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 , and the organic layer was washed with water. The organic phase was dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified with column chromatography on silica gel with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (5:1) as eluent to give 2b \u2013 2c as a pale yellow solid. 2.1.1.1 4-Heptoxyacetophenone ( 2b ) Yield: 72%. 1 H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl 3 ): \u03b4 7.93 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 6.92 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 4.01 (t, J = 6.6 Hz, 2H), 2.56 (s, 3H), 1.79 (m, 2H), 1.46\u20131.31 (m, 8H), 0.89 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 3H); GC\u2013MS: calcd. for C 15 H 22 O 2 [M + ]: 234, found: 234. 2.1.1.2 4-Hexadecoxyacetophenone ( 2c ) Yield: 58%. 1 H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl 3 ): \u03b4 7.93 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 6.93 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 4.02 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 2.56 (s, 3H), 1.79 (m, 2H), 1.46\u20131.26 (m, 26H), 0.88 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 3H); GC\u2013MS: calcd. for C 24 H 40 O 2 [M + ]: 361, found: 361. 2.1.2 General procedure for synthesis of ligands Into a 50 mL round bottom flask charged with pyridine (13 mL), 4-alkyloxyacetophone ( 2a \u2013 2c , 10 mmol) and iodine (2.54 g, 10 mmol) were added. The mixture was heated at 120 \u00b0C under nitrogen for 3 h. After cooling, the precipitate was filtered off, rinsed with cold ethanol, and dried in vacuum. Brown crystals of 1-(2-acetyl(4\u2032-alkoxyphenyl)) pyridinium iodine ( 3a \u2013 3c ) were obtained (yield 95%). The obtained pyridinium iodine, 1R-(\u2212)-myrtenal (1.56 g, 10 mmol), and ammonium acetate (1.60 g, 20 mmol) were then suspended in 15 mL dimethylformamide (DMF).

Precipitate was formed and the mixture was extracted with n-hexane (60 mL, four times). The organic layer was collected and dried with MgSO 4 . Solvent was then removed to form a slight yellow power.

Once the solution is cooled, it was diluted with 200 mL 1 M HCl to form a yellow precipitate. The precipitate was collected on a glass filter frit, dissolved in dichloromethane, and dried with MgSO 4 . Solvent was then removed by evaporation in reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on a silica column using n-hexane/ethyl acetate (5:1) as eluent to yield Ir(RO-pppy) 3 as bright yellow powders. The products then were purified by recrystallization from methanol for two times. 2.1.3.1 Iridium(III)tris(5-(4-methoxyl-phenyl)-10,10-dimethyl-4-aza-tricycloundeca-2,4,6-triene) Ir(CH 3 O-pppy) 3 ( 5a ) Yield: 42%. 1 H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl 3 ): \u03b4 7.50 (s, 1H), 7.46 (d, J = 9.8 Hz, 1H), 6.78 (d, J = 1.8 Hz, 1H), 6.63 (s, 1H), 6.43 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H), 3.61 (s, 3H), 3.01 (m, 2H), 2.50 (m, 1H,), 2.28 (m, 1H), 2.19 (m, 1H), 1.30 (s, 3H), 1.13 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 1H), 0.63 (s, 3H).

Ir(III) complexes and other compounds mass spectra were recorded on a MALDI-TOF (Model BIFLEXIII) spectrometer and a Finnigan 4021C GC\u2013MS spectrometer, respectively. Elemental analyses were performed by using a FLASH EA1112 elemental analysis system. The absorption and emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3010 UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer and a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. The emission lifetime were performed by using the time-correlated single-photon-counting technique with Edinburgh Instrument, Model FL920. 2.3 Device fabrication and characterization A layer of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene) doped with poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated inside the glove box from an aqueous solution onto a pre-cleaned and O 2 -plasma-treated indium-tin-oxide (ITO) sputtered glass substrate to form a \u223c50 nm-thick film, followed by baking at 100 \u00b0C for 30 min to remove residual water. Then the emitting layer, Ir(RO-pppy) 3 -doped in PVK\u2013PBD (m(PVK):m(PBD) = 0.7:0.3) in chlorobenzene solution were spin-cast at a speed of 2000 rpm onto the PEDOT:PSS covered substrates. The samples were then annealed at 80\u201390 \u00b0C for another 20 min for solvent removal. Then an ultrathin CsF interfacial layer with a thickness of 1.5 nm was incorporated between the polymer layer and the cathode. The devices were completed by co-evaporating 200 nm of Mg 0.9 Ag 0.1 as cathodes. Film thicknesses were measured with a Dektak-8 Stylus Profiler. Current\u2013voltage characteristic were recorded with Keithley 2400 source meter. Brightness and EL spectra were measured with a spectrascan PR650 photometer. All of the fabrications and measurements were carried out in ambience. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis of Ir(III) complex The molecular structures of new iridium(III) complexes Ir(RO-pppy) 3 used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1 . To investigate the influence of the chains, we designed the two side chains with different length: heptoxy chain (R C 7 H 15 \u2013) and hexadecoxy chain (R C 16 H 33 \u2013). For comparison, we also synthesized the ligand 4a (R CH 3 \u2013) and the corresponding complex 5a (Ir(CH 3 O-pppy) 3 ). Reactions were used to synthesize ligands are shown in Scheme 1 . All of the Ir(III) complexes are synthesized according to Krohnke condensation method [8] . The molecular structures of the complexes were characterized by 1 H NMR, MS/TOF-MS and elemental analysis. The synthesis of the Ir(III) complexes were relatively complicated. The reaction temperature strongly affects the facial/meridional product ratio of the reaction [13,14] . When temperature is \u223c200 \u00b0C, the facial isomer is the predominant product. The isomer should have the quite similar absorption and luminescence spectra and can be separated easily, which were also illustrated in the literature [15,16] . For comparison, we just chose the facial isomer to be investigated and used in device fabrication. They were all purified by recrystallization from methanol for two times before use. 3.2 Photophysical properties The absorption spectra at room temperature of the iridium complexes ( Fig. 2 ) were measured in dilute dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ) solution. Absorption data of all complexes are listed in Table 1 . All the absorption bands of three new Ir(III) complexes are almost identical, which suggests that the electronic nature of the lowest excited state is very similar among them. The spectra show intense bands appearing between 240 and 340 nm which are assigned to spin allowed \u03c0 \u2013 \u03c0 * transitions in the ligand. According to the previous works, in lower energy between 350 and 380 nm, a charge transfer (CT) contribution could be present since no absorptions are observed for the free ligand (see inset in Fig. 2 ) in this wavelength region [16\u201318] , we can attribute the bands to the transition from the singlet ground state to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer singlet state ( 1 MLCT), while the weaker absorption shoulders extending into the visible region \u223c490 nm are assigned to the formally spin-forbidden transition from the triplet MLCT state ( 3 MLCT) to the ground state. The phosphorescence spectra at room temperature and 77 K were measured in degassed 2-metyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) solution ( Fig. 3 ). Both the PL spectra data of these compounds are listed in Table 1 . The phosphorescence spectra measured at room temperature have two major peaks. At 77 K, Ir(CH 3 O-pppy) 3 and Ir(C 7 H 15 O-pppy) 3 show phosphorescence spectra with fine vibronic progressions between two major peaks. It seems that these complexes give phosphorescence from the dominantly ligand-centered 3 \u03c0 \u2013 \u03c0 * excited state [18] . Ir(C 16 H 33 O-pppy) 3 should be the same as Ir(CH 3 O-pppy) 3 and Ir(C 7 H 15 O-pppy) 3 . We did not find the vibronic feature probably due to the influence of the long hexadecoxy chains. In addition, the phosphorescence bands of the complexes Ir(CH 3 O-pppy) 3 and Ir(C 7 H 15 O-pppy) 3 are shifted \u223c9 nm to blue region on going from room temperature to 77 K because of the rigidochromic effect, as has been previously reported on some kinds of transition metal complexes [18,19] . But for Ir(C 16 H 33 O-pppy) 3 , no obvious blue-shift is observed. The phenomenon is very interesting and the reason is under discussing, perhaps we can also contribute the reason to its very long alkoxy chains, thus, the emission at 77 K still occurs from a relaxed excited state. Photoluminescence quantum yield in degassed toluene solution (bubbling for 0.5 h by Argon gas) at room temperature was determined by using quinine sulfate in 1N H 2 SO 4 as the standard (quantum yield 0.54) [20,21] . The samples are excited at the same wavelength (around 360 nm) which has small optical density (OD) value (<0.1). As showed in Table 1 , all the complexes show the relatively high quantum yield. The value of quantum yield of 5b and 5c are low with comparison to that of 5a , which also probably due to the long alkoxy chains, their great non-radiative decay decrease the emission. The decay process of triplet excited state of Ir(III) complex was investigated by using the time-correlated single-photon-counting technique. The samples were excited at the wavelength of 360 nm and monitored at their emission peak. The lifetime data of all complexes are listed in Table 1 . For comparison, we also measured the lifetime of the samples in 2-MeTHF solution under ambient conditions, the lifetime decreases dramatically to only around 40 ns. The long lifetime and quenching by oxygen are characteristics of phosphorescence. The radiative and non-radiative rate constants, k r and k nr , are also calculated based on the assumption that \u03a6 isc (intersystem-crossing yield) is 1.0 by the followed equations [18] : \u03d5 p = \u03d5 isc k r k r + k nr , \u2003 \u2003 \u03c4 = ( k r + k nr ) \u2212 1 Here, \u03a6 p and \u03c4 are the phosphorescence yield and the phosphorescence lifetime, respectively. The results are illustrated in Table 1 . 3.3 Device fabrication and OLED properties The high phosphorescence yield together with the short excited state lifetime makes these complexes promising materials for fabrication of highly efficient OLEDs. Fig. 4 shows the configuration of the devices and the molecular structures of the compounds used in device fabrication. PVK (81,800 Mw 48,800 Mn) was obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich and used without further purification. Poly (3,4-thylenedioxy thiophene) doped with poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was purchase from H.C. Stark. 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) was obtained from Alfa and used as received. There are large gap between ITO (\u22124.8 eV) and HOMO of PVK (\u223c\u22125.54 eV) [22] , and the LUMO of PBD (\u22122.6 eV) [23] and the Fermi level of Mg:Ag cathode (\u22123.7 eV). The PEDOT:PSS layer brings the anode Fermi level up to \u223c5.2\u20135.3 eV, which greatly reduces the barrier for hole injection [24] . CsF is known to dissociate and dope the organic/metal interfaces, and thus improves the electron injection for Mg:Ag cathodes. By inserting a PEDOT:PSS layer between ITO and the emitting layer (EML), and incorporating a thin CsF layer before Mg:Ag evaporation drastically reduce the driving voltage of the device. In our result, the turn-on voltage of the devices is almost all at approximately 4 V. The overlap between the absorption of the Ir(III) complex and the emission spectra of PVK:PBD allows efficient energy transfer from host to guest molecules via F\u00f6rster mechanism [10] . It should be point out that the triplet state of PVK ( T 1 = 2.46 eV) is higher in energy than that of the Ir(III) complex ( T 1 = \u223c2.40 eV), so triplet\u2013triplet energy transfer from PVK to Ir(III) complex may also occur via Dexter mechanism and phosphorescent guest (Ir(III) complex) will loss less of its energy through non-radiative means [10,11] . The EL spectra of alkyloxy-substituted Ir(III) complexes show a peak at around 492 nm and a shoulder at 518 nm, which are consistent to its PL performance in solution. For device fabrication, the concentration of Ir(CH 3 O-pppy) 3 ( 5a ) used were from 0.5% to 5.0% by weight. For comparison, we fabricated the devices according to the doping concentration of molar proportion for Ir(C 7 H 15 O-pppy) 3 ( 5b ) and Ir(C 16 H 33 O-pppy) 3 ( 5c ), respectively, as listed in Table 2 . We found that only about 0.5 wt.% of Ir-complexes is required to completely quench the host PL. Most of the devices exhibited low turn-on voltage and high brightness in excess of 10,000 cd/m 2 . But unfortunately, at higher concentration (e.g. 3.0 wt.% for Ir(CH 3 O-pppy) 3 ), the efficiencies of the devices decreased gradually. Some of the EL performances of the devices are summarized in Table 2 . Fig. 5 shows EL performance of the devices made from 1.6, 3.2 and 5.6 wt.% doping concentration of Ir(C 16 H 33 O-pppy) 3 ( 5c ). The devices turn on at approx 4\u20138 voltage, which is much lower in comparison with previous reports. The highest luminous efficiency of 19.9 cd/A and a power efficiency of 8.8l m/W were observed from 3.2 wt.% Ir(C 16 H 33 O-pppy) 3 -doped device. As concentration goes higher, the efficiency drops due to the possible concentration quenching arising from bimolecular interactions at higher doping levels. The same phenomenon were also observed in the devices based on Ir(CH 3 O-pppy) 3 ( 5a ) and Ir(C 7 H 15 O-pppy) 3 ( 5b ). Compared with the same devices made from Ir(pppy) 3 at our previous work, we obtained the devices with higher doped concentration (up to 3.2 wt.%) from the modified derivatives with relatively less efficiency decrease. The high brightness and considerable luminous efficiency of the devices indicate that these materials are promising electrophosphorescent emitters in PLEDs. The work to design the more efficient device architectures is in process. 4 Conclusion We have synthesized a new family of tris-(phenylpyridine)iridium(III) derivatives, Ir(RO-pppy) 3 , with alkoxy chains attached on ligands. The new complexes exhibit strong triplet emission with high phosphorescence quantum yield and short emission lifetime. The new Ir-complex with long hexadecoxy side chains exhibit special photophysical properties and the better electrophosphorescent performance, and a maximum luminance efficiency 19.9 cd/A (7.8 lm/W) at 9.1 V along with CIE coordinates (0.21, 0.53) were achieved with Ir(C 16 H 33 O-pppy) 3 as emitter. A maximum luminance of 15,700 cd/m 2 at 8.4 V was obtained from the device based on Ir(C 7 H 15 O-pppy) 3 . All these indicate that they are all suitable for solution-processible fabrication and proved to be good electrophosphorescent emitters in polymer light emitting device.

        "abstract": "Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging in the 700-1000 nm wavelength range has been very attractive for early detection of cancers. Conventional NIR dyes often suffer from limitation of low brightness due to self-quenching, insufficient photo- and bioenvironmental stability, and small Stokes shift. Herein, we present a strategy of using small-molecule organic dye nanoparticles (ONPs) to encapsulate NIR dyes to enable efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer to obtain NIR probes with remarkably enhanced performance for in vitro and in vivo imaging. In our design, host ONPs are used as not only carriers to trap and stabilize NIR dyes, but also light-harvesting agent to transfer energy to NIR dyes to enhance their brightness. In comparison with pure NIR dyes, our organic dye nanoparticles possess almost 50-fold increased brightness, large Stokes shifts (\u223c250 nm) and dramatically enhanced photostability. With surface modification, these NIR-emissive organic nanoparticles have water-dispersity and size- and fluorescence- stability over pH values from 2 to 10 for almost 60 days. With these superior advantages, these NIR-emissive organic nanoparticles can be used for highly efficient folic-acid aided specific targeting in vivo and ex vivo cellular imaging. Finally, during in vivo imaging, the nanoparticles show negligible toxicity. Overall, the results clearly display a potential application of using the NIR-emissive organic nanoparticles for in vitro and in vivo imaging.",

The effect of deposition position and source temperature were investigated in detail on the formation process of ZnTPP nanomaterials. The result indicates that ZnTPP nanomaterials and starting powders are two different types of polymorphism and exhibit different fluorescence emission activity. And the formation of ZnTPP nanorods may mainly attribute to the self-assembly in the gas phase on the base of VS mechanism.",

During growth the Sn substrate became a liquid, whose fluid surface induced the growth of SiO2 (from SiO disproportionation) into an aligned nanowire array on Sn surface. The liquid Sn itself further served as the solvent to dissolve elemental Si produced from SiO disproportionation. The high-density nanowire array is a type of microporous silica with a large surface area, which can serve as an efficient absorbent for scavenging heavy metal ions such as Hg (II) from water after surface modification with mercapto groups (-SH). \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "We develop a facile approach for the one-step growth of ultralong aligned copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) nanowire (NW) arrays in a large area, through a grating-assisted physical vapor deposition method. The grating serves as the alignment template that guides the oriented growth of NWs, however, the morphology of the NWs is not restricted by the template but is remarkably determined by the growth conditions. The resulting NW arrays possess rectangular cross-sections, ultralong length, perfect alignment and large uniformity, which hold great potential as promising blocks for future integrated devices. The mechanism of one-step growth and alignment of NW arrays has been well discussed. Transparent and flexible photoconductive devices based on the aligned NW arrays can be directly constructed on the grating, which exhibit a fast response speed, high stability and reproducibility. Transfer of the NW arrays from the grating for further applications, has also been achieved by using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as an elastic stamp. Flexible and electrically stretchable NW devices have then been fabricated on PDMS and demonstrate superior performances. The ability to make large area ultralong flexible organic NW arrays opens new possibilities for integrated device applications of organic nanostructures. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

However, NWs often have limited optical response to the intracellular environment changes. In this work, a near-infrared nanowire optical endoscope for high-resolution intracellular pH detection was developed by integrating the advantages of silicon nanowires and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). This optical endoscope has a high-resolution, sensitive response to local pH changes over the wide range of pH 4.0-9.0, an important range for most biological processes in cells, with high reproducibility, good reversibility, and at least one-week stability in an aqueous environment. The results indicate the great potential of a single SiNW SERS endoscope for intracellular pH monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Heavy metal complexes as the highly efficient phosphorescent emitters in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been extensively studied in recent years. The complexes containing Ir(M) have usually been modified to further improve electroluminescence (EL) efficiency. In our previous work, Ir( pppy)3[tris (5-phenyl-10,10-dimethyl-4-aza-tricycloundeca-2,4,6-triene) iridium] was synthesized by introducing pinene group as a spacer to decrease concentration quenching and showed good EL performances. In the present work, we studied the modified Ir(pppy)3 by attaching side alkoxy group to the pinene-2-phenylpyridine lig-and, which is hoped to improve the chemical compatibility with host and further inhibit phase segregation in polymer matrix. The new series of Ir(M) complexes [Ir(RO-pppy)3] were synthesized and the photophysical properties were investigated. Strong triplet emission peak at around 496 nm was observed with phosphorescence quantum yield \u00f8F = 0.4-0.6, emission lifetimes \u03c4=2-4 \u03bcs. Complex 8 [Ir( C16H33O-pppy)3] has special photophysical properties: no blue-shift on going from room temperature(298.15 K) to 77 K was observed and with relatively less part of long-lifetime in decay process. The results indicate that the complex with long side chains can reduce the aggregation between molecules, thus can be used as promising efficient phosphorescent emitter in OLEDs.",

Here, we report the synthesis of a silicon-based periodic nanowire structure using a periodic volume-changing Sn particle as catalyst. Contrary to the common VLS process, the nanostructure growth was instead governed by a catalyst head consisting of a mixture of solid and liquid, and liquid Sn segments periodically appeared in Si nanowires during the growth process. The liquid Sn segments catalyzed the growth of secondary or branching nanowires from the primary nanowires. The result reveals clearly that the unusual growth is governed by the dual action of VLS and oxide-assisted growth (OAG). It further suggests a new pathway to rational design and synthesis of periodic composite nanostructures by taking advantage of both VLS and OAG processes. \u00a9 2007 American Chemical Society.",

In this work, primary crystallites formed at the early stage do not follow the conventional route to grow into larger crystals, but rather choose to aggregate directionally to self construct into well-defined geometrical structures. Afterwards, core dissolution takes place in the central part via Ostwald ripening processes, where smaller metastable primary particles (crystallites) undergo mass relocation through dissolution and recrystallization from the centre to the surface, leaving a hollow interior architecture. By manipulating the growth kinetics, shapes of the as-prepared hollow architectures can be easily tuned from cage-like cubes to more complex octa-pod frameworks. The formation process has been investigated through the morphology evolution at different aging times, and possible formation mechanisms are proposed. This is the first example, to the best of our knowledge, of organic crystals following the reversed crystal growth route. Ostwald ripening processes are also verified to play a critical role for the hollowing of the crystals. These hollow structures with rough inner and outer surfaces find excellent humidity sensor applications with a fast response to the humidity change, along with an excellent device stability and reproducibility. The present findings offer guidelines for developing well-defined organic crystals with hollow interior spaces. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

Both fluorescence probe and differential scanning calorimetric methods (DSC) were used to determine the critical micellar formation temperature (CMT) of these copolymers dissolved in water solution. It was found that the diblock copolymer (PEO-PPO) has almost the same properties as triblock (PEO-PPO-PEO) copolymer for which the CMT value decreases with the increasing of the length of hydrophobic segment in the molecule of copolymers. But, for another kind of triblock copolymer (PPO-PEO-PPO), its properties are completely different. It is probably due to the fact that the hydrophobic moieties are located at the terminal part of copolymeric chain which causes the solution to form a crosslinking network structure. In addition, by using of the peak wavelength shift phenomenon in fluorescence spectrum of probe compound which was dissolved in solvents with different polarities, the polarity and the degree of organization of internal nuclei in micelle can be evaluated.",

Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and high angle annular dark field images showed that antimony was rich in the grain boundary of the bicrystal nanobelts. It was discovered that both sides of the bicrystal nanobelts were O-terminated toward the grain boundary.

From the acidity measurement it can be seen clearly that the systems studied were changed dramatically under irradiation.

In this work, we report the preparation of three types of single-crystal SiNWs with various turning angles via metal-assisted chemical etching using (111)-oriented silicon wafers near room temperature. The zigzag SiNWs are single crystals and can be p- or n-doped using corresponding Si wafer as substrate. The controlled growth direction is attributed to the preferred movement of Ag nanoparticles along 001 and other directions in Si wafer. Our results demonstrate that metal-assisted chemical etching may be a viable approach to fabricate SiNWs with desired turning angles by utilizing the various crystalline directions in a Si wafer.",

From the measurements of absorption, fluorescence and fluorescence quenching spectra and the photo-acid generation it was found that the photosensitive acid generation had the nature of a photo-electronic transfer process. Results indicated that in the fluorescence emission spectra of triazine compounds there were two emission regions, which were attributed to the localized excitation and intra-molecular charge transfer excitation, respectively. Results also indicated that the localized excitation and emission is most important for the photo-acid generation and the intra-molecular charge transfer effect is important for extension of the absorption region.

The bulky polyaromatic hydrocarbon units endow the molecules with high glass-transition temperatures, nonplanar twisty structures which reduce molecular aggregations. The bipolar transporting natures of these materials are demonstrated by single-carrier devices with supported of theoretical calculations. Nondoped organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) using these phenanthroimidazole derivatives as emitters show blue-violet to sky-blue emissions with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.16, 0.05) for TTP-TPI, (0.16, 0.07) for DPT-TPI, and (0.17, 0.24) for DPF-TPI. The TTP-TPI-, DPT-TPI-, and DPF-TPI-based nondoped devices show impressive external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 5.02, 5.25, 4.85%, respectively (corresponding current efficiencies: 2.10, 3.13, and 8.41 cd/A). These values are the best or among the best comparing to those of the reported nondoped OLEDs with the corresponding color gamuts. These devices also show small efficiency roll-off at high brightness (1000 cd/m2) with EQEs drop by 20.7, 12, and 0%. Moreover, with well-balanced carrier transport, DPF-TPI based device can achieve a higher brightness of 10000 cd/m2 with EQE maintaining at 4.49% (only drop by 7.4%). \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

In this paper, a new soluble anthracene derivative 2-tert-butyl-9,10-bis(9,9-dipropylfluorenyl)anthracene(TBPFA) was designed and synthesized. The compound exhibited pure-blue-light emitting(\u03bbmax=443 nm in dilute dichloromethane, \u03bbmax=450 nm in solid film) and high fluorescence quantum efficiency. The none-doped and doped single-layer devices were prepared successfully by spin coating process with TBPFA as blue-light emitting material and blue-light emitting host material respectively. In the doped device, TBPFA can transport energies to TBPe which is a good blue-light emitting material efficiently.",

Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed on the guest molecule BT (1,4-bis(benzothiazole-vinyl) benzene), host molecule TPBI (2, 2',2' '-(1,3,5-phenylene)tris-[1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole]), and their mixture deposited on an HOPG surface to study the OLED degradation mechanism due to thermal heating. At room temperature, BT and TPBI in the mixed layer show good compatibility and high PL intensity, but at higher temperatures, they show phase separation and aggregation into their own domains and a concomitant decrease in PL intensity. The PL intensity loss suggests ineffective energy transfer from TPBI to BT due to phase separation, which may cause OLED degradation. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) results show that the band gaps of TPBI and BT remain unchanged with the annealing temperature, suggesting that the heat-induced decay of OLED is related to the interfacial structural change rather than the respective molecular band gap. The results provide direct evidence showing how the molecular structures of the mixed layer vary and affect the PL intensity due to temperature.",

        "abstract": "The controlled growth and alignment of one-dimensional organic nanostructures at well-defined locations considerably hinders the integration of nanostructures for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we demonstrate a simple process to achieve the growth, alignment, and hierarchical patterning of organic nanowires on substrates with controlled patterns of surface wettability. The first-level pattern is confined by the substrate patterns of wettability. Organic nanostructures are preferentially grown on solvent wettable regions. The second-level pattern is the patterning of aligned organic nanowires deposited by controlling the shape and movement of the solution contact lines during evaporation on the wettable regions. This process is controlled by the cover-hat-controlled method or vertical evaportation method. Therefore, various new patterns of organic nanostructures can be obtained by combing these two levels of patterns. This simple method proves to be a general approach that can be applied to other organic nanostructure systems. Using the as-prepared patterned nanowire arrays, an optoelectronic device (photodetector) is easily fabricated. Hence, the proposed simple, large-scale, low-cost method of preparing patterns of highly ordered organic nanostructures has high potential applications in various electronic and optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Graphene/silicon (Gr/Si) heterojunctions with simple manufacturing process, high stability and excellent device performance have great potential in photovoltaic (PV) applications. In comparison to conventional PV panels with monotone colors, multi-color PV panels could be integrated in modern building facades and thus largely expand their application ranges. In this work, multi-color Gr/Si heterojunction PV devices were fabricated, for the first time, by taking advantage of the combination of ultra-thin highly transparent graphene and MgF2/ZnS anti-reflection coating. The double-layer film coating enabled the multi-color Gr/Si PV devices with both high color saturation and low optical loss. The PV devices exhibited respectable power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the range of 10.7\u201313.2%, depending on the color of the devices. In addition, PCE of the device with optimized anti-reflection coating reached as high as 14.6%, which is among the highest for the Gr/Si heterojunction solar cells. By varying the film thickness at different positions, a colored Gr/Si solar cell with visible pattern was made on a 2-in. Si wafer. Our work demonstrates the great potential of multi-colored Gr/Si solar cells for new-generation distributed solar energy systems with designable features.",

This tetrasubstituted fluorene was found to have good morphological and thermal stability with a high glass transition temperature of 192 \u00b0C and a decomposition temperature of 480 \u00b0C. A non-doped tri-layer blue fluorescent device based on this tetrasubstituted fluorene shows a deep blue emission with a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.16, 0.10) and a maximum power efficiency of 1.1 lm/W. An orange phosphorescent device using this tetrasubstituted fluorene as a host in conjunction with an iridium complex as dopant exhibits a maximum power efficiency of 21.0 lm/W, which is much higher than that of a biscarbazolylbiphenyl-based control device (11.5 lm/W) with the same device structure. Furthermore, by using the tetrasubstituted fluorene as a blue florescent emitter and a host for phosphorescent dopant, a white emitting OLED with a maximum power efficiency of 22.5 lm/W and CIE coordinates of (0.38, 0.33) were obtained. These results show that this tetrasubstituted fluorene is a versatile multifunctional material for OLED applications. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

As-fabricated ZnSe/SiO2 core/shell nanowires and nanoribbons were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The periodically twinned ZnSe core with a twinning period of about 10-30 nm has a sphalerite crystal structure and a common growth direction of {11-1]. The amorphous SiO2 shell has a thickness of about 5 nm. The formation mechanism can be explained by the surface pressure stress from SiO2 shell to ZnSe core at the solid/liquid interface. The materials show strong cathodoluminescence (CL) related to the mixed light emission composed of band gap emission and defect emission. The single periodically twinned ZnSe/SiO2 nanowire has pronounced a photoconduction effect with a fast response time. The results suggest that the periodically twinned ZnSe nanocables have potential application in nanoscaled photodetectors and optical switches. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

The UV-vis spectroscopic titration experiments indicated the formation of 1:1 stable complexes between 1 and PO4 3-. In addition, complex 1 has also a little response to HPO4 2-, but there are no any responses to other anions such as non-tetrahedron type anions and tetrahedron type anions. The binding manner and possible structure formed between the complex 1 and P04 3- were proposed. The experimental results and some consideration concerned to improve the selectivity of sensor on design were discussed preliminarily.",

However, by doping Ir(pppy)3, Ir(F-pppy)3 and Ir(F2-pppy)3 to the PVK and PBD matrix, great difference of the device properties have been observed. In order to investigate the reasons for these phenomena, we use steady- and time-resolved-spectroscopy to study the effect of energy transfer from host to guest and direct electron and hole trapping mechanisms on the light-emitting properties of the active layers. The experimental results show that the balanced carrier injection and high efficient charge trapping are important mechanisms for obtaining high-efficiency PhPLEDs with PVK as the host. PVK does not fit blue PhPLED preparation because of its lower triplet energy level. Doping PBD to PVK host will further decrease the triplet energy level of the host. Our work provides important photophysical basis for the design of the phosphorescent hosts and the PhPLED device.",

The multifunctional BPPI enables adaptation of several simplified device configurations. For example, a non-doped blue fluorescent device exhibits good performance with an external quantum efficiency of 3.16% and Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.15, 0.07). A high-performance orange phosphorescent device was found to have a high current efficiency of 23.9 cd A -1.

Abstract A new multifunctional compound, 4,4\u2032-di-(1-pyrenyl)-4\u2032\u2032-[2-(9,9\u2032-dimethylfluorene)]-triphenylamine (DPFA) has been designed, synthesized and applied respectively as host-emitter, electron- and hole-transporters in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). The compound exhibits good thermal stability with a glass transition temperature ( T g ) of 161 \u00b0C and shows blue emissions in both solution and films. OLEDs with DPFA playing various roles have been fabricated and characterized. The results show that DPFA has efficient bipolar charge transport properties for both hole and electron. By using DPFA as a blue emitter in a typical three layer device with a configuration of ITO/NPB(50 nm)/DPFA(20 nm)/TPBI(30 nm)/LiF(0.5 nm)/MgAg, highly efficient blue emission with a maximum luminescence efficiency of 5.1 cd/A (5.3 lm/W) is obtained. Keywords OLED Blue emitter Bipolar emitter 1 Introduction White organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) have drawn much attention due to their applications as backlights for liquid\u2013crystal displays and for solid-state lightings [1\u20134] . For these applications, high efficiency and long life-time are important. Phosphorescent OLEDs have been shown to harvest 100% of the excitons generated by electrical injection, corresponding to a four times increase in efficiency compared to that achievable in singlet-harvesting fluorescent OLEDs [5] . For this reason, white OLED using phosphorescent emitters has been a focus of intense research. Meanwhile, one bottleneck for further enhancing the efficiency of white OLEDs is the performance of blue phosphorescent emitters, which is far behind those of green and yellow phosphorescent emitters. Although many blue phosphorescent emitters have been reported, Iridium(III)bis[(4,6-difluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N, C 2 \u2032 ]picolinate (FIrPic) is still the best and most widely used blue phosphorescent emitter [6\u201310] . However, FIrPic is in fact a blue\u2013green emitter, with two peaks at 472 and 500 nm, respectively [11,12] . The color purity of the OLEDs based on FIrPic is thus compromised. Moreover, it is known that lifetime of FIrPic-based devices are often inadequate [2] . Till now, efficient blue phosphorescent emitters with a long lifetime have been scarce. Thus, more and more researchers have put efforts on white OLEDs which take advantages of red or yellow phosphorescent and blue fluorescence emitters. Therefore, high performance blue fluorescent emitters are expected to play an important role in white OLEDs. On the other hand, keeping a good balance of electron and hole currents in OLEDs is known to be important for achieving a high efficiency [13] . One possible way to improve the charge balance in OLEDs is to use emitters with bipolar charge transporting properties. Till now, reported bipolar emitters are mostly emitting in longer wavelength and there are few bipolar blue emitters [14\u201319] . In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new compound, 4,4\u2032-di-(1-pyrenyl)-4\u2032\u2032-[2-(9,9\u2019-dimethylfluorene)]-triphenylamine (DPFA). The compound exhibits good thermal stability with a glass transition temperature ( T g ) of 161 \u00b0C and shows blue emission in both solution and films. It was found that in addition to giving a strong blue emission, DPFA can also efficiently transport both electrons and holes. A device with the configuration of ITO/NPB(50 nm)/DPFA(20 nm)/TPBI(30 nm)/LiF(0.5 nm)/MgAg shows a low turn-on voltage of 2.8 V and highly efficient blue emission with a maximum luminescence efficiency of 5.1 cd/A (5.3 lm/W). 2 Experimental 2.1 Material synthesis All solvents were purified by routine procedures.

Anal. Calcd. For C 65 H 43 N: C, 93.41; H, 5.15%; N, 1.44%. Found: C, 95.20; H, 5.14%; N, 1.49%. Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 2S UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer and a Perkin Elmer LS50B Luminescence spectrophotometer, respectively. Glass transition temperatures ( T g ) were determined with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, TA instruments 2910MDSC) at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min. Decomposition temperature ( T d ) was obtained from TGA measurements using a TA instruments Q50 TGA with a heating rate of 20 \u00b0C/min. Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the new compound were measured directly by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) values were determined from the HOMO and the lowest energy absorption edge of the UV absorption spectra. Device fabrication and measurement: OLEDs were fabricated by vacuum deposition on ITO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 30 \u03a9/\u25a1. The emission area of each device was 10 mm 2 . Before deposition, the ITO substrate was carefully cleaned, rinsed with deionized water several times, dried in an oven at 120 \u00b0C for an hour, and finally treated with UV\u2013ozone. The ITO substrate was then loaded into a deposition chamber with a base pressure better than 3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mbar. The devices were fabricated by evaporating organic layers onto the ITO substrate sequentially at an evaporation rate of 2\u20134 \u00c5/s. The Mg:Ag alloy cathode was prepared by co-evaporation of Mg and Ag at a volume ratio of 10:1. EL spectra and CIE color coordinates of unpackaged devices were measured with a Spectrascan PR650 photometer and the current\u2013voltage\u2013luminescence characteristics were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source meter under ambient condition. 3 Results and discussion 4,4\u2032-Di-(1-pyrenyl)-4\u2032\u2032-[2-(9,9\u2032-dimethylfluorene)]-triphenylamine (DPFA) was synthesized according to the synthetic route in Scheme 1 . The molecular structure of DPFA was confirmed by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and element analysis. Thermal properties of DPFA were characterized by TGA and DSC measurements. DPFA is thermally stable up to 450 \u00b0C as shown by its high decomposition temperatures ( T d ) in the TGA measurements. DPFA sample melted at 268 \u00b0C in the first run of the DSC measurement. As the melted sample was reheated on the second run, a glass transition was observed at 161 \u00b0C. Fig. 1 shows absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of DPFA in a dichloromethane solution and in a solid film. The PL spectrum of DPFA in solution shows a deep blue emission peak centered at 425 nm. The PL spectra in solution and in film are similar except for a red shift of 45 nm in the solid film. The fluorescence quantum yield of DPFA in a dichloromethane solution was measured to be 0.63. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DPFA were determined to be 5.5 and 2.8 eV, respectively, by UPS and optical absorption. To investigate the electroluminescence and charge transporting properties of DPFA, five devices were fabricated with active layers of, I: DPFA(100 nm); II: NPB(50 nm)/Alq 3 (20 nm)/DPFA(30 nm); III: DPFA(50 nm)/Alq 3 (50 nm); IV: DPFA(60 nm)/TPBI(30 nm) and V: NPB(50 nm)/DPFA(20 nm)/TPBI(30 nm). All the devices were sandwiched between an ITO anode and a composite cathode of LiF(0.5 nm)/Mg:Ag. Device I is single layer device in which DPFA plays the role of emitter, hole- and electron-transporters. As shown in Fig. 2 , the turn-on voltage (defined as the driving voltage required to give a brightness of 1 cd/m 2 ) of Device I is only 2.7 V, which is unexpectedly low for an OLED employ only one organic material. At 5 V the device can give a blue emission (peaked at 476 nm) of more than 100 cd/m 2 with CIE coordinates of x = 0.17 and y = 0.29. Similarity of the PL and the EL spectra suggests that the EL can be attributed to the emission from the singlet excited state of DPFA. Table 1 lists key performance data of the device. While, the efficiency of device I is low, these results clear shown that DPFA can transport hole and electron and can be used as a host emitter. To further explore the bipolar carrier transport properties of DPFA, devices II and III have been fabricated to use DPFA as electron and hole-transporter, respectively. In device II (NPB/Alq 3 /DPFA) DPFA is used as the electron-transporter. The device turns on at 3.1 V ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ) and gives green Alq 3 emission peaked at 524 nm. It delivers a brightness of 11,490 cd/m 2 at 13 V and has a maximum efficiency of 3.0 cd/A. As performance of this device is similar to that of a standard bilayer NPB/Alq 3 device, it can be reasonably expected the electron-transporting ability of DPFA is comparable with that of Alq 3 . Device III has a typically double layer structure (DPFA/Alq 3 ) in which DPFA functions as the hole-transporter; whereas Alq 3 is used as the emitter and electron-transporter. The device shows green Alq 3 emission peaked at 518 nm. As shown in Fig. 4 , the turn on voltage of device III is just 2.5 V and the brightness is higher than 12,000 cd/m 2 at a voltage of 8 V. Device III has a maximum efficiency of 3.9 cd/A (3.2 lm/W), which is better than the performance of the standard NPB/Alq 3 device. The results suggest that DPFA is likely to have a better performance than NPB in terms of hole-transporting ability. Device IV has a bilayer structure of DPFA/TPBI. Due to the low-lying HOMO of TPBI, it is commonly used a hole-blocker. Thus, in device IV, electrons and holes are expected to recombine in the DPFA layer. Therefore, DPFA functions as a hole-transporting emitter here. As shown in Fig. 5 , the device shows a blue EL peak at 472 nm which can be attributed to the singlet emission of DPFA. A high maximum efficiency of 4.3 cd/A (4.5 lm/W) and CIE coordinates of x = 0.14 and y = 0.22 were observed. These results can firm that DPFA has good hole transporting properties and efficient blue emission. While results from devices I\u2013IV do show that DPFA has good electron and hole transporting properties, charge balance of electron and hole currents were not optimized due to mismatching of the energy levels between the organic layers and the electrodes in these devices. Thus, a typical three layers device with a configuration of NPB/DPFA/TPBI (device V) has been fabricated with DPFA as an emitter to improve device performance. I \u2013 V \u2013 L characteristics of device V are shown in Fig. 6 . The turn-on voltage of the device is only 2.8 V and the device delivers bright blue emission with a maximum brightness of 8072 cd/m 2 at a voltage of 7.6 V and a current density of 230 mA/cm 2 . Fig. 7 shows an EL spectrum of device V. The EL spectrum centers at 472 nm and the CIE coordinates are x = 0.14, y = 0.24. Current and power efficiencies of the device are shown in the inset of Fig. 7 . Device V has a maximum efficiency of 5.1 cd/A (5.3 lm/W). For accessing the performance of DPFA, operation parameters of several state-of-the-art OLEDs based on bipolar blue-emitters are tabulated in Table 2 . It can be seen that the efficiency of the device based on DPFA is among the best. With its highly efficient blue emission and bipolar charge transporting properties, DPFA can be a promising material for applications in both blue and white OLEDs. In summary, a new multifunctional compound, 4,4\u2032-di-(1-pyrenyl)-4\u2032\u2032-[2-(9,9\u2019-dimethylfluorene)]-triphenylamine (DPFA) has been synthesized and used respectively as a high efficiency blue emitter, a hole- and an electron-transporters in OLEDs. The compound exhibits good thermal stability with a glass transition temperature ( T g ) of 161 \u00b0C. The results show that DPFA has efficient bipolar charge transporting properties for both hole and electron. A typical three layer device with a configuration of ITO/NPB(50 nm)/DPFA(20 nm)/TPBI(30 nm)/LiF(0.5 nm)/MgAg gives blue emission of high efficiency (5.1 cd/A or 5.3 lm/W) comparable or better than current state-of-art bipolar blue-emitters.

        "abstract": "Two ambipolar host materials, 9,9-bis(9-methylcarbazol-3-yl)-4,5- diazafluorene (MCAF) and 9,9-bis(9-phenylcarbazaol-3-yl)-4,5-diazafluorene (PCAF), comprising two electron-donating carbazole units and an electron-accepting 4,5-diazafluorene group, have been designed, synthesized, and characterized. Given the nonplanar structure of the sp 3-hybridized C9 atom of the 4,5-diazafluorene unit, MCAF and PCAF exhibit high triplet energy levels of 2.82 and 2.83 eV, as well as high glass-transition temperatures of 187 and 188 \u00b0C, respectively. Equipped with ambipolar transport properties as well as suitable highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, the two compounds excellently perform in blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PHOLEDs). The MCAF-based blue PHOLED has a very low turn-on voltage of 2.6 V, a high current efficiency of 32.2 cd A -1, a high external quantum efficiency of 17.9%, a high power efficiency of 31.3 lm W -1, and a low efficiency roll-off with a high efficiency of 27.6 cd A -1 even at 10 000 cd m -2.

In this study, template-free electrode-position was employed to fabricate oriented one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures. Furthermore, it was found that morphologies and dimensions of these ZnO nanostructures can be controlled by adjusting several parameters during the electrodeposition process. The concentration of ZnCl2 in the electrolyte greatly affects the chemical composition and dimensions of the ZnO nanostructures. Arrays of ZnO nanorod could only be formed at relatively low concentration of ZnCl2. Highly-oriented arrays of ZnO nanorods with higher number density and smaller diameter could be obtained on the substrates with a thin layer of pre-coated ZnO nanoparticles or Pt metal. The applied potential and solution temperature also influence the growth rate of ZnO nanorods and thus led to the change of the dimensions of the nanstructures.",

        "abstract": "Sb-doped ZnO nanoribbons have been synthesized by simple thermal evaporation of powder mixtures of Zn and Sb 2O 3. The Sb-doped ZnO nanoribbons with hexagonal wurtzite structure have a growth direction of [011\u03040], widths of 100-300 nm, and lengths up to several hundreds of micrometers. The atomic ratio of Sb and Zn is about 1:40 by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurement. A stripe contrast is found in the center of the Sb-doped ZnO nanoribbon, which is speculated to be due to the enrichment of Sb in the center of the Sb-doped ZnO nanoribbon by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scanning element mapping. Furthermore, a novel Zn 7Sb 2O 12 branched ZnO nanoribbon structure is investigated. The growth direction of the branch and the backbone are [21\u03041] and [011\u03040], respectively. The mechanisms of formation of such nanomaterials are also discussed. Copyright \u00a9 2006 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",

Here we report a facile method to assemble silicon nanowires (SiNWs) into large-area desired patterns by applying an external alternating electrical field between two photoresist-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. By manipulating the electrode geometries through photolithography, pattern shapes can be tuned, from parallel strips, concentric circles, grid-like structures to square windows. The patterns can be firmly preserved on the substrate after the removal of photoresist, and can be readily transferred onto a flexible and insulating substrate for further device applications. These NW patterns formed on the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flexible substrate found excellent applications as both humidity and optical sensors with outstanding device stability and reproducibility. Moreover, it was found that the silver nanoparticle decorated-SiNW (AgNPs@SiNW) patterns could serve as an excellent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate for sensing Rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",

However, most systems have low drug loading capacity and cause safety concerns. Therefore, many anticancer therapeutics have recently been assembled to NPs form without using any additional nanocarrier to achieve high drug loading. However, carrier-free nanomedicines are often constrained by limitations such as inadequate stability and lack of control in drug release. Therefore, we synthesize carrier-free drug NPs containing cis-aconitic anhydride-modified doxorubicin and paclitaxel (CAD-PTX) and coating with crosslinked (CL) surfactant based on hyaluronic acid (HA) segment. With this design, the pure drug NPs possess pH and redox dual responsive release characteristic and could target CD44 overexpressed cancer cells. Our studies demonstrate that these CAD-PTX-CLHA NPs display high stability, excellent active targeting effect and controllable intracellular drug release, and ultimately achieve significantly better anti-cancer efficiency than individual doxorubicin and paclitaxel.",

        "abstract": "Organic nanostructure-based photodetectors are important building blocks for future high-performance, low-cost, flexible nano-optoelectronic devices. However, device integration remains a large challenge, and the structure-dependent performance of the device has been seldom studied. Here, we report the in situ integration of 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl]squaraine (SQ)-nanowire (NW)-array-based photodetectors by growing the organic NW arrays on prefabricated electrodes through an evaporation-induced self-assembly process. In contrast with ohmic-contact devices, asymmetric electrode pairs of Au-Ti were utilized to achieve the construction of Schottky-type photodetectors on the basis of organic NW arrays. Significantly, the Schottky-type photodetectors exhibited a significantly enhanced performance as compared to the ohmic-type devices in terms of their higher photosensitivity and switching speed. The presence of a strong built-in electric field at the junction interface, which greatly facilitated the separation/transportation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, was suggested to be responsible for the superior performance of the Schottky-type photodetectors. More importantly, the organic NW-array-based devices also showed a higher sensitivity and reproducibility than that of the single NW-based devices, and they were capable of low-light detection. The investigation of the photodetector circuitry also disclosed a very low pixel-to-pixel variation owing to the average effect of the NW-array-based devices. It is expected that organic NW-array-based Schottky-type photodetectors will have important applications in future organic nano-optoelectronic devices.",

It was found that the modified \u03b2-cyclodextrin has a specific recognition ability to Cu2+ in aqueous solution, and the quenching constant is about one order of magnitude larger than that of other metals which were studied in this work. But in non-aqueous solvents, such as in DMF, the specific recognition ability of Cu2+ disappeared. And the Ni2+, which has a planar configuration, presented the strongest ability of complex formation. It was resulted from the four ethylene groups connected each other by hetero-atom in linking chain of the modified \u03b2-cyclodextrin to make the formation of planar square configuration easily. The results demonstrated that the possibility of the spacial structure match of the host and the guest plays a very important role in the complex formation.",

The pinene substitution introduces steric hindrance to molecular structure of the dopant that reduces triplet-triplet annihilation between dopants and consequently enhances device performance. Via endothermic energy transfer from poly(vinylcarbazole) to Ir (F-pppy)3 and Ir (F2 -pppy)3, a peak electroluminescent efficiency of 32.8 cdA or 12.3 cdA at 12 wt % Ir (F-pppy)3 or 15 wt % Ir (F2 -pppy)3 doped and solution-processed PLEDs have been obtained.

        "abstract": "Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), as a powerful analytical tool, has attracted great interest in the development of chemical and biological sensors because of its ultrahigh sensitivity and amenability to molecular fingerprinting. However, practical applications with current SERS sensors based on colloidal metal nanoparticles (NPs) or a rough metal film remain great challenges, due to the poor stability and low reproducibility. Here, we report a facile strategy to prepare highly sensitive SERS sensors with excellent reproducibility and stability based on uniform and well-controlled silver NP-decorated silicon nanowire (AgNP@SiNW) building blocks. In this strategy, uniform, size- and interparticle distance-controlled AgNPs are deposited on SiNWs, yielding abundant hot spots. A single AgNP@SiNW exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity with an enhancement factor of 4.12 \u00d7 10 9, spot-to-spot and wire-to-wire reproducibility, and good stability in an aqueous environment. Furthermore, sensors fabricated with this AgNP@SiNW building block have diverse applications that are demonstrated with a single NW for microscopic detection of a low concentration of carbaryl (0.01 mg mL -1) residues on a cucumber surface with 1 s acquisition time and an assembled thin film sensor for label-free, real-time detection of E. coli in drinking water. This combination of prominent SERS performances, highly efficient detection, and accessibility in multiple sample matrices indicates that our facile SERS sensor fabrication strategy has the potential to increase the applicability of the SERS technique in the real world. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate the first investigation of highly branched small-molecular organic microcrystals via self-organization of crystallites at the nucleation stage and then growth kinetics manipulation at the crystal growth stage. Temperature control was found to be critical in the formation of the branched structures. At higher temperature (25 \u00b0C), crystallites follow the conventional growth route to minimize the total surface energy under thermodynamic control, and grow into polyhedral crystals. While at lower temperature (15 \u00b0C), crystallites would follow the reversed crystal growth route and preferentially self-aggregate into well-defined cage-like cubes. The branched octapod-shaped microcrystals are formed with nucleation at 15 \u00b0C for crystallites to self-organize into cube-within-cube aggregates, and then subsequent anistropic overgrowth from each corner of eight cubes at 25 \u00b0C. The higher growth rate along <111> directions induces the formation of the octapod structures. Surfactant was also found to encourage the secondary branching on the octapod-shaped architectures. This work provides a simple approach to synthesize organic microcrystals with a highly branched structure, which are expected to be useful as building blocks in nanoelectronics and nanocircuits. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

These mass nanowires are characterized through X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction, and high-resolution TEM, which have uniform diameters of about 40 nm and microns of several decades in length. The growth of ZnScO nanowires is suggested for self-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid. In particular, PL spectra of these nanowires show emission peaks that intensely shift to long wavelength with increasing Sc and the doping quantity is found responsible for the different characteristics, in which PL mechanism is explained in detail. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The cosolvents used included methanol (MOH), ethanol (EOH), 1-propanol (POH), 2-methoxyethanol (ME), ethylene glycol (EG), ethanolamine (EA) and ethylenediamine (ED) that were introduced to the aqueous solution of block copolymers as a component of solvent. It was found that the introduction of some cosolvents which were compatible well with both water and PPO segments prevented the micelle formation and made the CMT increase, while other cosolvents were favorable for micelle formation and CMTdecreased. The cosolvents with difunctional group and smaller size were benefited for the formation of micelle with closed packaging nuclei. It was also found, in condition that there was a little cosolvent introduced, the polarity of internal nuclei of micelle was mainly determined by the degree of packaging, but little relevant with the polarity of cosolvents.",

        "abstract": "Ultraweak light detectors have wide-ranging important applications such as astronomical observation, remote sensing, laser ranging, and night vision. Current commercial ultraweak light detectors are commonly based on a photomultiplier tube or an avalanche photodiode, and they are incompatible with microelectronic devices for digital imaging applications, because of their high operating voltage and bulky size. Herein, we develop a memory phototransistor for ultraweak light detection, by exploiting the charge-storage accumulative effect in CdS nanoribbon. The memory phototransistors break the power law of traditional photodetectors and follow a time-dependent exponential-association photoelectric conversion law. Significantly, the memory phototransistors exhibit ultrahigh responsivity of 3.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009A\u2009W and detectivity of 7.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910 Jones. As a result, the memory phototransistors are able to detect ultraweak light of 6\u2009nW\u2009cm with an extremely high sensitivity of 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910. The proposed memory phototransistors offer a design concept for ultraweak light sensing devices.",

The effects of substitution on their photoluminescence (PL) and eletroluminescence were studied. It was observed that the fluorescence quantum yield of the compound PD2 with a methoxy substitutional group is larger than that of the compound PD1, which has an N,N-dimethlyamino substitutional group. On the other hand, when these compounds were used as dopants in blue-light-emitting organic electroluminescent devices with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/TPD/TPBI:2% PD1 or PD2/TPBI/Mg:Ag, the device with PD1 as the dopant was more efficient than that with PD2 despite the higher fluorescence quantum yield of PD2. The PD1-doped device emitted blue light, which peaked at around 487 nm with a luminance of 1224 cd/m 2 at a current density of about 420 mA/cm 2.",

The Sdots show not only non-blinking and high-brightness fluorescence but also stability in various pH conditions and heavy metal ion solutions. More importantly, Spiro-BTA Sdots demonstrate obviously much higher brightness with very high signal-to-background ratio in Hela cell, compared with common CdSe/ZnS QDs. In addition, they exhibit large Stokes shifts, broad absorption spectra, and low toxicity to living cells which enable their applications as good fluorescence probes for bio-imaging. Further application of Sdots for folate receptor-mediated live-cell endocytosis was demonstrated by non-convalent modification with folic acid linked multidentate ligands.",

        "abstract": "A series of anthracene based blue host materials was synthesized and characterized with respect to their chemical, luminescence, film-forming and thermal properties. The anthracene derivatives are strongly blue fluorescent ( \u03bb f = 435\u2013445 nm) with high fluorescence quantum yields ( \u03a6 f = 0.71\u20130.85). All of these compounds have excellent film-forming properties and thermal properties. Organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) fabricated using these three compounds as blue host emitter and using 0.5-wt% tetra ( t -butyl) perylene (TBPe) dopant in the emitting layer exhibit good light emitting performance with bright blue emission. 1 Introduction Since the pioneer work of multi-layered organic light-emitting diode (OLED) by Tang et al. [1] , OLED has attracted much attention because of its promising applications in full color flat-panel displays [2\u20136] . For full color displays, three primary colors (red, green, blue) are necessarily. Many new materials with red, green and blue emitting colors have been developed to meet the requirements [7\u201318] . Apart from developing high efficient materials, another key factor to develop commercializable OLEDs is to optimizing the device structure. It is well recognized that EL efficiency, CIE coordinates and operational stability of OLED can be significantly improved by using host\u2013guest doped emitter system [3] . Good host materials with high thermal stability, good film-forming properties and high quantum fluorescence efficiency are necessary. Comparing with green and red OLED, there are very limited host materials to choose for blue OLED because of the large band gap required for blue emitting materials. 9,10-Di(2-naphthyl) anthracene (ADN) is a major blue host material, which was first developed by Kodak. Tetra ( t -butyl) perylene (TBPe) doped in ADN has realized efficient of blue luminance efficiency of 3.5 cd/A, a CIE coordinates of x = 0.15, y = 0.23 and a half-life of 4000 h with initial light output at 700 cd/m 2 [19] . However, it was also reported that the film forming properties of ADN is not acceptable. The thin film of ADN was found to be morphologically unstable, and could accelerate the decay and reduce the lifetime of the device [20\u201322] . In this letter, we report the synthesis of a series of anthracene derivatives, namely 2- tert -butyl-9,10-di(2-naphthyl) anthracene (TBADN), 2- tert -butyl-9,10-di(9-phenanthryl) anthracene (TBDHA) and 2- tert -butyl-9,10-di(1-pyryl) anthracene (TBDPA). With the purpose of disrupting the symmetry of ADN so that the problematic crystallization in thin film can be suppressed, a tert -butyl group at 2-position of the anthracene moiety is introduced. All three compounds have good thermal stability, good film forming property and show blue emission with high fluorescence quantum yield. We report the fabrication and the performance of blue OLEDs using these compounds as blue host emitters. In addition, devices using these compounds as host materials and TBPe as blue dopant are also fabricated and performance are also reported here. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Material synthesis All solvents are purified by routine procedures. Other reagents are used as received from commercial sources, unless otherwise stated. The three compounds were synthesized by a common procedure as described for TBADN. 2.1.1 2- tert -butyl-9, 10-di(2-naphthyl) anthracene (TBADN) To 2-bromo-naphthalene (2.08 g, 10 mmol) dissolved in 10 ml tetrahydrofuran (THF), 6.3 ml of n -butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane) was added slowly at \u221278 \u00b0C. The suspension was stirring for two hours at this temperature and 2- tert -butylanthraquinone (1.32 g, 5 mmol) in 10 ml THF was added drop wise in half an hour. The suspension was kept stirring for additional 2 h at \u221278 \u00b0C and then left to cool down to room temperature. 300 ml of cold water was added and the reaction was kept stirring for another 2 h. The suspension was extracted by ether several times and the combined organic fractions were dried over magnesium sulfate. Ether was removed in vacuum and the residue was obtained. To this residue, 3 g of SnCl2 and 35 ml of acetic acid were added and the mixture was refluxed for 3 h. After cooling, the precipitate was collected and washed with plenty of water. The compound was dried in vacuum and recrystallized in toluene to obtain 1.7 g white powders.

TGA measurements were performed on TGA2050 with a heating rate of 20 \u00b0C/min. The HOMO values were measured by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and the LUMO values were calculated from the HOMO values and the band gaps measured from the UV absorption spectra. Blue OLEDs were fabricated by vacuum deposition on the top of ITO glass substrate with a sheet resistance of 50 \u03a9/\u25a1. Before deposition, the ITO substrate was thoroughly cleaned, dried in an oven, and finally treated with UV-ozone. The ITO substrate was then loaded into a deposition chamber with a base vacuum less than 10 \u22127 Torr. The devices were fabricated by evaporating organic layers onto the ITO substrate sequentially. The evaporation rate of the organic layer was 2\u20134 \u00c5/s and the Mg:Ag alloy cathode was prepared by co-evaporation of Mg and Ag at a volume ratio of 10:1. EL spectra and CIE color coordinates were measured with a Spectrascan PR650 photometer and the current\u2013voltage\u2013luminescence characteristics were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. 3 Results and discussion The anthracene derivatives synthesized for this work are shown in Scheme 1 and the synthetic route utilized for these compounds illustrates in the scheme. The three compounds can be synthesized according to the synthetic route with reasonably high yields of 65\u201370%. Molecular structures of TBADN, TBDHA and TBDPA were confirmed with 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and element analysis (EA). 3.1 Thermal and film-forming properties The thermal properties of the three compounds were determined by TGA measurements. The TGA scans for the three compounds are shown in Fig. 1 and that of ADN is also included in this figure for comparison purpose. All of the compounds are thermally stable up to 320 \u00b0C in air. It is clearly observed that the decomposition temperature ( T d ) of TBADN is lower than that of ADN. The decrease of the T d of TBADN compared with ADN could be attributed to the tert -butyl substituted in the 2-position of anthracence. However, the phenanthryl and pyryl instead in the C-9, 10 position of 2- tert -butyl anthracene, the decomposition temperature is increased substantially and is much higher than that of ADN. Relevant thermal data of the three compounds and ADN are listed in Table 1 . In order to achieve good light-emitting performance, thin films formed from the materials used in OLED should be amorphous and uniform. The properties of the film are critical to the performance of OLED and especially have a big effect on the lifetimes of OLED. To study the film-forming properties of the three compounds, thin films with same thickness on indium tin oxide (ITO) were prepared by vacuum deposition. The surface morphologies of these films are characterized by atomic-force microscopy (AFM). For comparison, ADN film at the same thickness was also measured by AFM. The AFM images of the thin films of these compounds are shown in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2 a, the surface of ADN film is quite rough and many small crystallites are detected on the surface. The average roughness ( R a ) of the ADN film is 8.49 nm. Though some pinholes exist in the TBADN film ( Fig. 2 b), the R a of the film is only 0.43 nm. By Comparing TBADN film with ADN film, it is concluded that the film-forming property of TBADN is much better than that of ADN. As illustrated in Fig. 2 c and d, the films of TBDHA and TBDPA are quite amorphous and uniform with average roughness of 0.45 nm and 0.44 nm, respectively. It is concluded that by introducing tert -butyl and large aryl groups in anthracene can improve the film-forming properties. 3.2 Optical properties The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the compounds were measured in dilute dichloromethane solution and as a solid film on a quartz plate obtained by thermal evaporation. Photo-physical data of the three compounds and ADN are also listed in Table 1 . Absorption and emission spectra of the three compounds are shown in Fig. 3 . The absorption spectra of TBADN and TBDHA are almost identical and show the characteristic vibration pattern of the anthracene group ( \u03bb max = 340, 360, 378, 396 nm) in solution. The absorption spectrum of TBDPA consists of the overlap of characteristic vibration pattern of the pyrene and anthracene group. These results suggest that the substituents of these three anthracene compounds are poorly conjugation between the anthracene core and substituted aryl groups in ground states. Upon photo-excitation, the three compounds are strongly fluorescent in dilute solutions and the emission wavelength ranged from 435 nm to 445 nm. Photo luminescence data of the thin film of the three compounds are list in Table 1 . The red shift of the PL spectra between film samples and solution are attributed to the difference of dielectric constant of the environment [23] . Fluorescence quantum yields of the three compounds in dichloromethane solution were measured by using 9,10-diphenylanthracene ( \u03a6 f \u223c 0.90) as a calibration standard [14] . All of the three compounds give bright blue fluorescence with high quantum yields ( \u03a6 f = 0.71\u20130.85). 3.3 Electroluminescent devices OLEDs using these three compounds as blue host emitters were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) (15 nm)/ 4,4\u2032-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl amino] biphenyl (NPB) (50 nm)/host emitter (30 nm)/tris (8-quinolinolato) aluminum (Alq 3 ) (50 nm)/Mg:Ag (200 nm). In these devices, ITO (indium tin oxide) and Mg:Ag are the anode and cathode, respectively; CuPc is the hole injection material; NPB is the material for the hole transporting layer (HTL); and Alq 3 is the material for the electron transporting layer (ETL). Fig. 4 shows EL spectra of the OLEDs based on these three compounds. EL spectra of the devices based on TBADN, TBDHA, and TBDPA are peaked at 456 nm, 452 nm, and 468 nm, respectively. The similarity of the PL and EL spectra indicates that the EL can be attributed to emission from the radiation decay of singlet-excited state of the three compounds. The current efficiency versus current density characteristics for the three devices is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 4 . TBADN based device exhibit a maximum current efficiency of 2.0 cd/A, which is comparable to that of the device based on ADN [19] . TBADN based device exhibits bright blue emission with a purer blue CIE coordinates of x = 0.16; y = 0.14 as compared to x = 0.20; y = 0.26 for ADN based device, which is blue green emission [19] . The maximum efficiency of TBDPA based device is higher than that of ADN based device. This increase in efficiency may be attributed to the higher fluorescence quantum efficiency and longer wavelength of emission. EL performances of the three OLEDs are list in Table 2 . To study the EL properties of these three compounds as blue host materials, OLED using these three compounds as blue host and TBPe as blue dopant are fabricated. The device has the following structure of ITO/CuPc (15 nm)/NPB (50 nm)/blue host: TBPe (30 nm)/Alq 3 (50 nm)/Mg:Ag (200 nm). The blue host doped TBPe emission layer was produced by co-evaporation blue host materials and TBPe simultaneously and the ratio is controlled to be 0.5-wt%. Important electroluminescence performances data of the doped devices are list in Table 2 . The current efficiency versus current density characteristic of TBDHA doped TBPe based device is shown in Fig. 5 and the EL spectrum of the doped device are shown in the inset of the figure. Maximum current efficiency of the device is 3.1 cd/A corresponding to 1.5 lm/W with a CIE coordinates of x = 0.14; y = 0.23. The emission spectrum of the doped device shows only narrow vibronic features that are characteristic of the TBPe dopant and this feature indicates that there is complete energy transfer from host material to dopant. Most important to note in this figure is that the efficiency of the device remains quite stable from a low current density to a higher current density. Doped devices with TBADN and TBDHA have better efficiency and maximum brightness as compared to its corresponding non-doped devices. The efficiency of TBADN doped device is comparable to that of the device based on ADN with a similar device structure, which is shown in Table 2 . While doped device using TBDPA is comparable to its un-doped device. This result is partly due to incomplete energy transfer from host to dopant because of the poor overlap between the emission spectrum of host material and the absorption spectrum of dopant molecular. 4 Conclusion In summary, a series of anthracene based blue host materials was synthesized for application in OLEDs. All three compounds reported have good thermal stability and film-forming property. Large aryl group substituted on anthracene moiety could improve the thermal properties. Introduction of tert -butyl in anthracene and using large aryl groups substituted anthracene could improve the film-forming properties. All of the anthracene derivatives are strongly blue fluorescent with high fluorescence quantum yields. Organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) fabricated with these three compounds as blue host emitter and using 0.5-wt% tetra ( t -butyl) perylene (TBPe) doped emitting devices exhibit good light emitting performance with bright blue emission.

In this approach, aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles were used as templates to direct the self-assembly of the pyrene molecules into nanorods. It was found that changing the concentration ratio of the pyrene to SDS molecules could be employed to control the aspect ratio (length to diameter) of the pyrene nanostructures from 1 to 50 or higher. Moreover, the dimensional variation was accompanied by changes of their optical properties. With the increase of the aspect ratio, the characteristic fluorescence of the isolated pyrene molecules was suppressed and concurrently replaced by the excimer emission of the pyrene nanostructures. A blue-shift was observed in the excimer emission peaks as the length of the nanorods increased. The growth mechanism and the change in optical properties of these pyrene nanostructures were discussed in detail.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of a D-\u03c0-A structural strategy incorporating diphenylamine as an electron-donor and 1,3,5-triazine as an electron-acceptor with a short benzene \u03c0-conjugated feature, 4-(4,6-diphenoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-N,N- diphenylaniline (POTA), a novel blue fluorophor with high triplet energy level has been designed and synthesized to achieve high performance single-emitting-layer (single-EML) fluorescence and phosphorescence hybrid white organic light-emitting diodes (F-P hybrid WOLEDs). POTA exhibits efficient blue electrofluorescence and excellent host features for green and red phosphorescent devices. The single-EML RGB F-P hybrid WOLED based on POTA and green/red complexes shows a maximum total power efficiency of 59.8 \u00b1 1.0 lm W-1 and a maximum total external quantum efficiency of 24.7 \u00b1 0.7%, representing the highest efficiencies among single-EML RGB WOLEDs. Moreover, these performances are comparable with multiple-EML RGB WOLEDs even based on p-i-n structures, providing verification of the high performance and simple structure of single-EML RGB F-P hybrid WOLEDs. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "We have demonstrated controlled preparation of Ni(DMG)2 microrods/tubes via chemical reaction method. By manipulating the reaction kinetics via the concentration of reactants, shapes of the resulting microstructures can be easily tuned from microrods to microtubes. Size of the resulting products can also be controlled through changing the reaction temperatures. It was proposed that under high reactants' concentrations, molecules will prefer to grow at corners or edges of nuclei with high free energies, to reduce the total energy in the system, which would lead to partial or complete hollow interiors and eventually resulted in mircotubes. The fact that DMG show high selectivity with Ni2+ and accompanied with obvious color change enable us to fabricate test strip for naked-eye detection of Ni2+. Benefit from the large surface areas of DMG nanoparticles on the test strip, the detection limit is improved by two orders over that of conventional solution method. This strategy is sensitive, simple and easy to handle, thus expected to possess potentials for the practical Ni2+ detection applications.",

        "title": "Anthracene derivative for a non-doped blue-emitting organic electroluminescence device with both excellent color purity and high efficiency",
        "abstract": "A new anthracene derivative 2- tert -butyl-9,10-bis-(\u03b2-naphthyl)-anthracene (TBADN) was synthesized and used as a blue light-emitting material in a non-doped organic light-emitting diode (OLED). The OLED showed efficient blue emission with excellent Commission International de L\u2019Eclairage (CIE) coordinates ( x = 0.14, y = 0.10) and a maximum current efficiency of 2.6 cd/A. Compared with the prototypical blue OLEDs based on 9,10-bis-(\u03b2-naphthyl)-anthracene, the present device showed much improved color purity and efficiency. The improved performance is due to the reduction of molecular aggregation and the change of molecular electronic state by introducing of the bulky tert -butyl group on anthracene. Since the pioneering works on organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) by the Kodak [1] and Cambridge [2] groups, extensive research works have been carried out to bring OLEDs into commercial applications in flat-panel displays in the past decade [3\u20136] . Apart from optimizing device structure, another key approach for developing marketable OLEDs is the development of high-performance materials with desirable properties. Many new materials with RGB (red, green, blue) emitting colors have been developed to meet the requirements for full-color displays. While green emitting materials are relatively well developed for OLEDs, satisfactory blue materials with good color purity, high efficiency and good stability are still in demand. Although many blue emitting dyes have been developed for OLEDs, [7\u201315] there is still a clear need for further improvements in terms of efficiency and color purity. For example, although the OLEDs based on a current state-of-the-art blue material \u2013 9,10-bis-(\u03b2-naphthyl)-anthracene (ADN), show excellent stability, the electroluminescent spectrum of the undoped device is broad and featureless, and greenish blue in color centering at 460 nm with the CIE coordinates of x = 0.197 and y = 0.257. By doping 2, 5,8,11-tetra- tert -butylperylene (TBP) into ADN host, the efficiency is significantly improved from less than 2.0 to 3.5 cd/A with an acceptable blue color (the CIE coordinates are x = 0.154 and y = 0.232) [10] . The color purity and efficiency of most OLEDs are often mutually compromised. So, there is still a room for improvements of both efficiency and color purity of EL devices based on this series of materials, especially in undoped devices. In this Letter, we report an efficient pure non-doped blue OLED based on a new anthracene derivative, 2- tert -butyl-9,10-bis-(\u03b2-naphthyl)-anthracene (TBADN). The undoped device shows high efficiency at 2.6 cd/A and excellent saturated blue color with the CIE coordinates x = 0.14 and y = 0.10, which are almost identical to the coordinates of National Television System Committee (NTSC) standards (0.14, 0.08). The molecular structure of TBADN is shown in Fig. 1 . It was prepared via Suzuki coupling reaction and characterized by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and element analysis [16] . Devices with a configuration of ITO/TPD (70 nm)/TBADN (9 nm)/TPBI (45 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Mg:Ag was fabricated by vacuum deposition. The structures of these molecules are shown in Fig. 1 . ITO coated glass with a sheet resistance of about 100 \u03a9/\u25a1 was used as the substrate and the anode. TPD ( N , N \u2032-diphenyl- N , N \u2032-bis(3-methylphenyl)(1,1\u2032-biphenyl)-4,4\u2032-diamine), TBADN and TPBI (2,2\u2032,2\u2033-(benzene-1,3,5-triyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) were used, respectively, as the hole-transport layer (HTL), the emitting layer (EL), and the electron-transport layer (ETL). A thin LiF layer is interposed between Mg:Ag and TPBI to enhance electron injection from the cathode into the EL. An MgAg alloyed layer is used as the cathode. Before deposition, the ITO substrate was cleaned with isopropyl, alcohol and deionized water, dried in an oven, and finally treated with UV-ozone. The ITO substrate was then loaded into a deposition chamber with a base pressure better than 10 \u22127 Torr. The device was fabricated by evaporating organic layers onto the ITO substrate sequentially. The evaporation rate of the organic layer was 2\u20134 \u00c5/s. The Mg:Ag alloy cathode was prepared by co-evaporation of Mg and Ag at a volume ratio of 10:1. The highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level was determined from Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) measurements and the corresponding lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level was estimated from UPS and photoabsorption measurements. The EL spectra and CIE color coordinates were measured with a spectrascan PR650 photometer. The current\u2013voltage\u2013luminescence characteristics were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 SourceMeter under ambient atmosphere. The absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer and a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of a dilute solution of TBADN in dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ) and the TBADN thin film obtained by thermal evaporation. The absorption of TBADN shows the characteristic vibration pattern of the anthracene group ( \u03bb max = 340, 360, 378, 396 nm) in solution. The shape of the absorption spectra in solution and film is almost identical except a 5 nm shift. The emission peaks of TBADN in solution and film are at 435 and 441 nm, respectively. The shifts of absorption and emission spectra in solution and film probably are due to the difference in dielectric constant of the environment [17] . Fig. 3 shows the EL emission spectra of the blue OLED under different luminance. It can be seen that the EL peak is very narrow, centering at 452 nm and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is about 60 nm. Since the peak wavelength position of the emitting spectrum of TPD and TPBI are not round 450 nm, it is reliable to assign the blue light emission to come from TBADN. It is common that the EL spectrum of a blue-light emitting device changes with current density or applied voltage. However, the spectra of our blue emitting device at a luminance of 100 and 1000 cd/m 2 are almost identical when the intensity of two spectra is normalized ( Fig. 3 ). The CIE coordinates of x = 0.14 and y = 0.10 remain unchanged at different luminance from 100 and 1000 cd/m 2 , which is highly desirable for full color displays. The energy level diagram of the blue OLED is shown in Fig. 1 . The hole is transported through the HTL of TPD into the emitting layer but is blocked by the higher energy barrier at the interface of TBADN and TPBI. The electron is injected into the TPBI layer from the cathode. It may be concluded that the charge combination and light emission occurred at the interface of TBADN and TPBI layer. Fig. 4 shows the current density and the luminance vs voltage for the device. As shown in Fig. 4 , the turn-on voltage is 4.5 V, and the luminance is 435 and 1715 cd/m 2 at a current density of 20 and 100 mA/cm 2 , respectively. The maximum current efficiency is about 2.6 cd/A, which is better than 2.0 cd/A of the ADN device without dopant in [10] . The performance may be further improved with the optimization of the device structure or suitably doped TBADN layer. Both the color purity and current efficiency of the TBADN device are better than that of ADN device with the same device structure. The PL of the films of TBADN and ADN with the same thickness coated on quartz glass by thermal evaporation is studied at the excited wavelength of their equal absorption point. It is found that the PL quantum efficiency of TBADN film is higher than that of ADN. This result is the same with that of the result, which are compared in dilute solution of dichloromethane. This may be the reason of the TBADN device has a higher current efficiency than the ADN device. Fig. 5 shows the EL Spectra of TBADN and ADN devices with the same device structure, while the inset depicts the two spectra with their peak aligned. The inset shows that the EL spectrum of ADN has a long tail in the longer wavelength region compared with that of TBADN. The absence of tailing explains why the TBADN device has a better color purity than the ADN device. Tails in the longer wavelength region could be attributed to the charge transfer complex formation at the interface between the HTL and EML [7] . The absence of tail in our device can be attributed to the non-planer molecular structure of TBADN due to the bulky tert -butyl group on ADN, which prevents the emitting material from packing with the hole transporting material at the interface. In summary, a new anthracence derivative TBADN was synthesized and used in organic light-emitting device. The EL device shows a maximum current efficiency of 2.6 cd/A and the CIE coordinates of x = 0.14 and y = 0.10, which are comparable to the best result in blue OLEDs with a similar color purity. The improvements of efficiency and color purity compared to those of the ADN-based device was attributed to the reduction of molecular aggregation and the change of molecular electronic state due to the placement of the tert -butyl group on the anthracene.

Changes in shape observed are accompanied by distinct changes in optical properties. Crystal structure analysis shows that they have different molecular stacking modes, which were believed to be responsible for the properties difference. This also helps us gain insight into the crystal growth process and better understand the formation mechanism of different morphological crystals. We believe that the crystal structure may be locked at the nucleation stage and expected to vary with the solubility change.

Achieving aligned organic nanowire arrays that can be patterned on a surface with well-controlled spatial arrangement is highly desirable in the fabrication of high-performance organic devices. We demonstrate a facile one-step method for large-scale controllable patterning growth of ordered single-crystal C(60) nanowires through evaporation-induced self-assembly. The patterning geometry of the nanowire arrays can be tuned by the shape of the covering hats of the confined curve-on-flat geometry. The formation of the pattern arrays is driven by a simple solvent evaporation process, which is controlled by the surface tension of the substrate (glass or Si) and geometry of the evaporation surface. By sandwiching a solvent pool between the substrate and a covering hat, the evaporation surface is confined to along the edge of the solvent pool. The geometry of the formed nanowire pattern is well defined by a surface-tension model of the evaporation channel. This simple method is further established as a general approach that is applicable to two other organic nanostructure systems. The I-V characteristics of such a parallel, organic, nanowire-array device was measured. The results demonstrate that the proposed method for direct growth of nanomaterials on a substrate is a feasible approach to device fabrication, especially to the fabrication of the parallel arrays of devices.",

Electron microscopy 1 Introduction Since the first discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 (ref. [1] ), there have been significant research efforts to fabricate one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials such as nanotubes, nanowires (nanorods) and nanobelts (nanorings) [2\u201316] . As a wide band-gap (3.37 eV at room temperature) and large exciton binding energy (60 meV) semiconductor [4,5,12\u201316] , ZnO is interest of low-voltage and short wavelength electro-optical devices including light emitting diodes and laser devices [4,5,12\u201316] . Therefore, syntheses of 1D ZnO nanostructures have been widely reported [4,5,12\u201316] . For example, Yang's and co-workers research group made a ZnO nanowire array with an ultraviolet laser [12] and a dendritic nanowire ultraviolet laser array [13] . Wang et al. reported about induced growth of an asymmetric nanocantilever array on polar surfaces [4] , single-crystal nanorings formed by epitaxial self-coiling of polar nanobelts [5] , and bicrystalline ZnO nanowires [16] . In addition, our research group [17] studied on a high-density, ordered ultraviolet light-emitting ZnO nanowire array. As is well known, doping in semiconductor with selective elements offers an effective approach to adjust their electrical, optical, and magnetic properties, which is crucial for practical applications [18\u201320] . Recently, this doping technique has been used for syntheses of nanoscale materials [18\u201320] . For example, Zhang's and Wang's research groups reported about S-doped ZnO nanowires [18] and manganese-doped ZnO nanobelts [19] , respectively. Also, Hou and co-workers fabricated indium-doped ZnO nanobelts [20] . Very recently, resistance and humidity sensing properties of Cd-doped ZnO nanowires [21] have been reported. However, there has been no report about the controlled contents of Cd dopants nanowires up to now. In fact, because of the similar structure of the electronic shell, transition metal cadmium has many physical and chemical properties similar to those of transition metal zinc. Moreover, based on our recent experimental results [9,22] , Cd inside the compound of CdO can be easily substituted by Zn in vapor deposition reactions and then CdO nanoparticles mixed with Zn can become Cd-doped ZnO wire-like nanomaterials. It is essential that zinc substitutes part of the Cd in the CdO nanoparticles, which may turn the CdO nanoparticles into the Cd-doped ZnO nanowires by replacement of the main part of Cd 2+ in the temperature. Here, we report a simple physical evaporation approach to form controlled single-crystal Cd-doped ZnO nanowires in a bulk quantity based on the self-catalyzed vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid mechanism. 2 Experimental In a typical experiment, two small quartz boats were firstly cleaned using standard treatment in Piranha solution (10% H 2 O 2 + 20% H 2 SO 4 ), and rinsed with deionized water. Zn powders (5.0 g) were placed at a quarter of one boat and then Cd powders (0, 0.08, 0.21 or 0.80 g) were each respectively added in half of the boat, which was then covered with the other empty boat to maintain a high local pressure. The two boats were inserted into half of a large quartz-tube in a horizontal tube furnace. The system was quickly heated to 600 \u00b0C under 50 sccm oxygen gas flow at a pressure of about 10 \u22122 Torr for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, large-scale pale-yellow wool-like products were seen in the inner end of the large quartz tube. Phase and composition of the as-synthesized products were studied by means of XRD (X\u2019pert MRD-Philips diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 0.154178 nm, Philips, Holland) and XPS [MKII XPS, employed with Al X-rays, C1s ( E = 285.6 eV) level served as the internal standard, VG Scientific Instruments Corp. England], respectively. The sample was directly mounted on an Al stub with conductive carbon paints and then characterized by SEM [XL 30-S-FEG, Philips, Holland]. For further micro-analysis, a little of the products obtained so was ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and a drop of such sample was deposited on a holey copper grid with carbon film and then characterized by TEM, SAED and HRTEM [JEOL-2010, with EDX attachment (6853-H, Horiba, England), operated at 200 kV, Tokyo, Japan]. 3 Results and discussion A typical SEM image of the as-obtained sample is shown in Fig. 1 a , in which the image reveals that the sample is composed of large quantities of long wire-like nanostructures with the length of several hundreds of microns and the uniform diameter of about 20 nm. XRD pattern has been shown in Fig. 1 b where the as-synthesized Cd-doped (about 8%) ZnO nanowires are produced and the major of diffraction peaks are corresponding to ZnO crystal faces. That weak CdO peaks occur in the pattern reveals that a small amount of CdO is synthesized during the experiment. Based on the analysis from the XRD results, the sample is a typical one of the wurtzite (hexagonal) structure with lattice constants of a = b = 0.3252 nm and c = 0.5224 nm, which is consist with standard the crystalline ZnO bulk (JCPDS Card File, No. 36-1451, the International Centre for Diffraction Data, Newton Square, PA 1995). No other crystal forms are detected. Further, Fig. 2 a is a typical TEM image of the as-syntheized Cd-doped ZnO sample, in which large-scale nanowires with the diameter of about 20 nm are seen. SAED patterns (the inset in Fig. 2 b), taken from a little white ring of the stem of individual nanowire in Fig. 2 a, are recorded with a W electron beam perpendicular to the nanowire. The SAED indicates that the nanowire is a typical single-crystalline structure, which is consistent with the single crystalline nature of the nanowire. A HRTEM image from the little ring section is shown in Fig. 2 b, which further confirms that the nanowire is the single-crystalline phase due to their clear candy strip and the length is 0.342 nm between both arrows as shown in Fig. 2 b. From the HRTEM image and the SAED patterns, we know that the growth direction is (0 1 3) as indicated by a large black arrow in Fig. 2 b. Four spectra of EDX are displayed in Fig. 3 , where they are recorded based on four different the as-synthesized Cd-doped ZnO samples. From Fig. 3 , we know that Cu peaks come from the Cu grid. These results of EDX of the nanowires show that they are mainly composed of Zn and O, with a small amount of Cd, which is determined by the period of reaction time and the ratio of the reaction source. We have obtained Cd-doped ZnO nanowires with different content of Cd by changing the period of reaction time and the reaction source. Fig. 3 a\u2013d correspond to 30, 60, 90 and 120 min of reaction time, respectively, as well as the different ratio of Zn and Cd powders. Further, quantitative analysis of EDX indicates that the atomic ratios of Cd in ZnO nanowires are about 0%, about 1%, about 4% and about 8%, respectively. In addition, high-resolution XPS spectra of the as-synthesized Cd-doped (about 8%) ZnO nanowires are displayed in Fig. 4 a\u2013c , where Fig. 4 a\u2013c exhibit the binding energy peaks of O 1s at 531.6 eV, of Zn 3p2 at 87.25 eV and of Cd 3d5 at 405.25 eV, respectively. According to the area of the peaks the ratio of O:Zn:Cd in the nanowires is about 100:92:8, which may demonstrate that a 1:1 Cd-doped ZnO composition within experimental error is consistent with stoichiometric (Zn + Cd)O. The result of XPS (Cd-doped (8%) ZnO nanowires) analyses are compatible with that of EDX (Cd-doped (8%) ZnO nanowires). A key question here is why the Zn powders and Cd powders are formed in the form of single-crystalline Cd-doped ZnO nanowire, just similar to the syntheses of GaN nanowires [6,7] and Cd x Zn 1\u2212 x S whiskers [9] of our research group. The formation process of ZnCdO composition could be simple one-step-reaction from a chemical reaction point of view, that is, (1) 2(Cd + Zn) (eutectoid [22,23]) + O 2 \u2192 2ZnCdO. However, the formation of ZnCdO nanowire would involve a very complicated process. Because of the fact that the nanowires can only be formed below a certain process temperature (600 \u00b0C), and only in a place away from the center of the tube furnace (lower temperature range), we can reasonably speculate the nanowire formation process as follows: mixed (Zn + Cd) vapor is carried by the processing gases (O 2 ) and travel to the lower temperature region in the furnace tube and become into metal eutectoid (Zn + Cd) droplet [9,20,22,23] , where it deposits in the form of a liquid droplet on the inner wall of the tube. Then the liquidized droplet reacts with O 2 (g) and forms ZnCdO (solid), which further serves as a seed for ZnCdO nanowire growth, and the above growth is most likely to be controlled by the conventional vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) mechanism [6,20\u201325] . In the present VLS growth of these ZnCdO nanowires, no additional transition metals are added as catalysts; therefore, it is believed that the formation of these ZnCdO nanowires undergoes a self-catalyzed VLS growth process. Metal eutectoid (Zn + Cd) not only acts as the reactant but also provides an energetically favored site for the absorption of O 2 . After having formed ZnCdO nucleus, the nucleus functions as a seed, which further grows to a ZnCdO nanowire in the presence of eutectoid (Zn + Cd), and the size and the shape of the nanowire are predecided by the size of the new eutectoid metal droplet. 4 Conclusions Based on a low temperature chemical vapor deposition, mass Cd-doped ZnO nanowires are fabricated. It is essential that we employ the technology to be simple and inexpensive, as well as good repeatability. Cd-doped ZnO nanowires that we report here are optically active. In especial, based on a simple way, the Cd-doped mass in ZnO nanowires can be controlled by the reaction source concentration. They could therefore offer opportunities for further fundamental research and technological applications in Cd-doped ZnO photoelectric nanodevices.

Liquid metal is proposed to serve as a substrate for the initial growth of vertically aligned NWs. NWs could then be harvested from the growth substrate and integrated with functional substrates. Fabricated vertically aligned silicon NWs (SiNWs) were grown on molten Sn and then integrated into a flexible transparent poly(dimethylsiloxane) film to obtain a SiNW/functional substrate device.

To date, the most extensively studied photoacoustic imaging agents are inorganic nanomaterials because organic materials with NIR-absorption capabilities are limited. In this study, a NIR-absorbing nanocomplex composed of a squaraine dye (SQ) and albumin was prepared based on the aggregation-induced NIR absorption of SQ. Through aggregation, the absorption spectrum of SQ was widened from the visible-light region to the NIR region, which facilitated photoacoustic signal generation in the tissue-transparent NIR optical window (700-900 nm). Blood analysis and histology measurements revealed that the nanocomplex can be used for PAT applications in vivo without obvious toxicity to living mice.",

        "abstract": "Recently, bipolar host materials have attracted considerable attention because they can achieve balanced charge injection/transport in phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) and consequently obtain excellent device performance. In this work, two bipolar host materials, namely, 3-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-9-phenyl-9H-carbazole (DPTPCz) and 3-(4,6-diphenoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-9-phenyl-9H-carbazole (DPOTPCz), have been designed, synthesized and characterized. With high triplet energy levels of 2.78 and 2.86 eV for DPTPCz and DPOTPCz, respectively, two compounds are considered promising bipolar host materials for PhOLEDs. Blue and green PhOLEDs based on these two new compounds show excellent performances. The phosphorescent devices based on DPTPCz exhibit maximum external quantum efficiencies of 14.4% (for blue device) and 21.2% (for green device), and maintain high efficiencies of 11.9% and 20.0% even at a high luminance of 10,000 cd m(-2).",

        "abstract": "Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to produce H2 is a renewable method for addressing the worldwide energy consumption increasing and fossil fuels storage shrinking. In order to achieve sustainable PEC H2 production, the semiconductor electrodes should have good photo-absorption ability, proper band positions, and chemical stability in aqueous condition. Different from the large-band-gap semiconductors such as TiO2, which can work efficiently under UV light, Si is an narrow-band-gap semiconductor that can efficiently absorb visible light; however, Si is indirect semiconductor and susceptible to photocorrosion in aqueous solution. In this paper, we demonstrate a new strategy of first protecting and then activating to develop a stable visible light photoanode for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. This AgNPs/PEDOT/SiNW arrays show an encouraging solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of 2.86 % and a pronounced incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) across the whole visible region. Our strategy proposed here contributes to further improvement of corrosion protection and solar energy harvesting for narrow-band-gap semiconductors that employed in visible light photoelectrochemical and photoelectric conversion applications.",

However, it is still challenged by visible light photoelectrodes. The present work reports fabricating highly efficient and stable Si nanowires (SiNWs) array as visible light photoelectrodes. It involves embedding SiNWs arrays into a transparent polymer substrate to build an axial carrier collection geometry. We demonstrated that this strategy could significantly strengthen the chemical stability of SiNWs by largely reducing their surface area. Moreover, this device structure can also enhance visible light absorption efficiency through taking advantage of the highly crystalline structure of vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) grown SiNWs. Thus it can double the photodegradation ability of SiNWs.",

For example, the origins for the growth of periodic one-dimensional nanostructures are not fully understood. Here we observe that morphologies in a wide range of periodic one-dimensional nanostructures can be described by two quantitative relationships: first, inverse of the periodic spacing along the length direction follows an arithmetic sequence; second, the periodic spacing in the growth direction varies linearly with the diameter of the nanostructure. We further find that these geometric relationships can be explained by considering the surface curvature oscillation of the liquid sphere at the tip of the growing nanostructure. The work reveals the requirements of vapour-liquid-solid growth. It can be applied for quantitative understanding of vapour-liquid-solid growth and to design experiments for controlled growth of nanostructures with custom-designed morphologies.",

        "abstract": "Silicon is the dominant semiconductor in modern society, but the rigid nature of most Si structures hinders its applications in flexible electronics. In this work, Si-based flexible strain sensors are fabricated with Si fabric consisting of long Si nanowires. The as-obtained sensors demonstrate a large strain range of 50% and a gauge factor of up to 350, which are sufficient to detect human motions with superior performance over traditional sensors. The results reveal that the assembling strategy may potentially be applied to large-scale fabrication of highly sensitive, flexible strain sensors for emerging applications such as healthcare and sports monitoring. Moreover, the Si fabric would also enable broad applications of Si materials in other flexible and wearable devices such as flexible optoelectronics and displays.",

        "abstract": "Zero-dimensional graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have lately intrigued intensive interest because of their great promise in energy, optoelectronic, and bio-imaging applications. Herein, we demonstrated the fabrication of highly efficient GQDs/n-silicon heterojunction solar cells via a simple solution process. Owing to the unique band structure, the GQDs layer could not only serve as hole transport layer to facilitate the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, but also act as electron blocking layer to suppress the carrier recombination at anode. Moreover, graphene was used as the transparent top electrode for the heterojunction solar cells, ensuring the efficient light absorption and carrier collection. By adjusting the sizes of GQDs and the thickness of GQDs layer, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 12.35% under AM 1.5G irradiation was achieved, which represented a new efficiency record for this new-type solar cell. The devices also exhibited excellent stability in air due to the high chemical/physical stability of GQDs and graphene. The successful achievement of the high-efficiency GQDs/Si heterojunction solar cells opens up the opportunities for their potential applications in high-performance and low-cost photovoltaics.",

        "abstract": "Ambipolar organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) combining single-crystalline p- and n-type organic micro/nanocrystals have demonstrated superior performance to their amorphous or polycrystalline thin-film counterparts. However, large-area alignment and precise patterning of organic micro/nanocrystals for ambipolar OFETs remain challenges. Here, a surface-energy-controlled stepwise crystallization (SECSC) method is reported for large-scale, aligned, and precise patterning of single-crystalline laterally stacked p-n heterojunction microbelt (MB) arrays. In this method, the p- and n-type organic crystals are precipitated via a stepwise process: first, the lateral sides of prepatterned photoresist stripes provide high-surface-energy sites to guide the aligned growth of p-type organic crystals. Next, the formed p-type crystals serve as new high-surface-energy positions to induce the crystallization of n-type organic molecules at their sides, thus leading to the formation of laterally stacked p-n microbelts. Ambipolar OFETs based on the p-n heterojunction MB arrays exhibit balanced hole and electron mobilities of 0.32 and 0.43 cm V s , respectively, enabling the fabrication of complementary-like inverters with large voltage gains. This work paves the way toward rational design and construction of single-crystalline organic p-n heterojunction arrays for high-performance organic, integrated circuits.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS ), a typical 2D metal dichalcogenide (2DMD), has exhibited tremendous potential in optoelectronic device applications, especially in photodetection. However, due to the weak light absorption of planar mono-/multilayers, limited cutoff wavelength edge, and lack of high-quality junctions, most reported MoS -based photodetectors show undesirable performance. Here, a structurized 3D heterojunction of RGO-MoS /pyramid Si is demonstrated via a simple solution-processing method. Owing to the improved light absorption by the pyramid structure, the narrowed bandgap of the MoS by the imperfect crystallinity, and the enhanced charge separation/transportation by the inserted reduced graphene oxide (RGO), the assembled photodetector exhibits excellent performance in terms of a large responsivity of 21.8 A W , extremely high detectivity up to 3.8 \u00d7 10 Jones (Jones = cm Hz W ) and ultrabroad spectrum response ranging from 350 nm (ultraviolet) to 4.3 \u00b5m (midwave infrared). These device parameters represent the best results for MoS -based self-driven photodetectors, and the detectivity value sets a new record for the 2DMD-based photodetectors reported thus far. Prospectively, the design of novel 3D heterojunction can be extended to other 2DMDs, opening up the opportunities for a host of high-performance optoelectronic devices.",

However, the conventional doping method by introducing impurities into the nanostructures suffers from the low efficiency, poor reliability, and damage to the host lattices. Alternatively, surface charge transfer doping (SCTD) is emerging as a simple yet efficient technique to achieve reliable doping in a nondestructive manner, which can modulate the carrier concentration by injecting or extracting the carrier charges between the surface dopant and semiconductor due to the work-function difference. SCTD is particularly useful for low-dimensional nanostructures that possess high surface area and single-crystalline structure. The high reproducibility, as well as the high spatial selectivity, makes SCTD a promising technique to construct high-performance nanodevices based on low-dimensional nanostructures. Here, recent advances of SCTD are summarized systematically and critically, focusing on its potential applications in one- and two-dimensional nanostructures. Mechanisms as well as characterization techniques for the surface charge transfer are analyzed. We also highlight the progress in the construction of novel nanoelectronic and nano-optoelectronic devices via SCTD. Finally, the challenges and future research opportunities of the SCTD method are prospected.",

However, integrated device application of the organic micro/nanocrystals is hampered by the difficulty in high-throughput, high-precision patterning of the micro/nanocrystals. In this study, the authors demonstrate, for the first time, a facile capillary-assisted alternating-electric field method for the large-scale assembling and patterning of both 0D and 1D organic crystals. These crystals can be precisely patterned at the photolithography defined holes/channels at the substrate with the yield up to 95% in 1 mm . The mechanism of assembly kinetics is systematically studied by the electric field distribution simulation and experimental investigations. By using the strategy, various organic micro/nanocrystal patterns are obtained by simply altering the geometries of the photoresist patterns on substrates. Moreover, ultraviolet photodetectors based on the patterned Alq3 micro/nanocrystals exhibit visible-blind photoresponse with high sensitivity as well as excellent stability and reproducibility. This work paves the way toward high-integration, high-performance organic electronic, and optoelectronic devices from the organic micro/nanocrystals.",

Graphene can serve as p-type layer to form heterojunction with n-type crystalline Si. However, improvement of device performance is hindered by the relatively low junction height arising from the small work function of graphene. Herein, for the first time, we develop and implement a surface inversion layer on Si substrates by surface charge transfer doping (SCTD) scheme using a layer of high work function metal oxide (MoO3) as a hole injection layer on Si surface. Spontaneous hole injection from the MoO3 layer to Si led to the generation of a hole inversion layer on Si surface, greatly enhancing the built-in electric potential and suppressing the carrier recombination. The use of SCTD method, in combination with additional device optimization by graphene doping and polymer anti-reflection coating, results in a high power conversion efficiency approaching 12.2%. The SCTD scheme provides a new platform to further enhance the performance of graphene/silicon heterojunction solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Solution-processed n-type organic semiconductor micro/nanocrystals (OSMCs) are fundamental elements for developing low-cost, large-area, and all organic logic/complementary circuits. However, the development of air-stable, highly aligned n-channel OSMC arrays for realizing high-performance devices lags far behind their p-channel counterparts. Herein, we present a simple one-step slope-coating method for the large-scale, solution-processed fabrication of highly aligned, air-stable, n-channel ribbon-shaped single-crystalline N,N\u2032-bis(2-phenylethyl)-perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (BPE-PTCDI) arrays. The slope and patterned photoresist (PR) stripes on the substrate are found to be crucial for the formation of large-area submicron ribbon arrays. The width and thickness of the BPE-PTCDI submicron ribbons can be finely tuned by controlling the solution concentration as well as the slope angle. The resulting BPE-PTCDI submicron ribbon arrays possess an optimum electron mobility up to 2.67 cm2\u00b7V\u20131\u00b7s\u20131 (with an average mobility of 1.13 cm2\u00b7V\u20131\u00b7s\u20131), which is remarkably higher than that of thin film counterparts and better than the performance reported previously for single-crystalline BPE-PTCDI-based devices. Moreover, the devices exhibit robust air stability and remain stable after exposing in air over 50 days. Our study facilitates the development of air-stable, n-channel organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and paves the way towards the fabrication of high-performance, organic single crystal-based integrated circuits.",

In comparison to conventional PV panels with monotone colors, multi-color PV panels could be integrated in modern building facades and thus largely expand their application ranges. In this work, multi-color Gr/Si heterojunction PV devices were fabricated, for the first time, by taking advantage of the combination of ultra-thin highly transparent graphene and MgF 2 /ZnS anti-reflection coating. The double-layer film coating enabled the multi-color Gr/Si PV devices with both high color saturation and low optical loss. The PV devices exhibited respectable power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the range of 10.7\u201313.2%, depending on the color of the devices. In addition, PCE of the device with optimized anti-reflection coating reached as high as 14.6%, which is among the highest for the Gr/Si heterojunction solar cells. By varying the film thickness at different positions, a colored Gr/Si solar cell with visible pattern was made on a 2-in. Si wafer. Our work demonstrates the great potential of multi-colored Gr/Si solar cells for new-generation distributed solar energy systems with designable features.",

Research attention has recently been focused on developing simple ways of fabricating large-area OSSC arrays by means of solution-coating techniques. However, the lack of control of the meniscus front, where the nucleation and growth of organic crystals occur, leads to inconsistent crystal alignment and consequently induces large variation in device performance. Here, we propose a universal strategy, termed the channel-restricted meniscus self-assembly (CRMS) method to fabricate ultrahigh-mobility, uniform OSSC arrays. The microscale photoresist channels used in this method produce a confinement effect to reduce the size of the meniscus, enabling the homogeneous nucleation of OSSCs at the meniscus front. Meanwhile, the dip-coating process ensures consistent molecular packing in the OSSCs and thus guarantees their highly uniform electrical properties. Using 2,6-diphenylanthracene as an example, wafer-scale (u003e2\u202finch) OSSC arrays with very small size variations (10%) are successfully prepared, which is very difficult to achieve by using the previously reported methods. As a result, field-effect transistors (FETs) based on the OSSC arrays show a high average hole mobility of up to 30.3\u202fcm 2 \u202fV \u22121 \u202fs \u22121  with good uniformity among devices. This method is general for the growth of various OSSC arrays, facilitating the applications of OSSCs in large-area, high-performance organic electronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Organic semiconductor micro/nanocrystals (OSMCs) have attracted intensive research over the past few decades. Their unique electrical and mechanical properties afford them applications in a vast network of active flexible electronic and optoelectronic fields, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), photodetectors (PDs), and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) etc. However, the growth orientation and location of OSMCs are usually stochastic in nature, which hinders the further use of OSMCs in large-area plastic electronic devices. On the other hand, traditional microelectronic processing techniques like photolithography may damage the plastic substrates, polymer insulators, and organic materials. Thus the alignment and patterning of OSMCs and development of new device construction technologies are prerequisite for their flexible device applications in practice. In this progress report,the important advancement for fabricating the aligned and patterned OSMCs, with a focus on their applications in next-generation flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices, is highlighted. Also, the challenges and outlooks of the ordered and patterned OSMCs in the flexible device applications are presented.",

        "abstract": "High-performance phototransistors made from organic semiconductor single crystals (OSSCs) have attracted much attention due to the high responsivity and solution-processing capability of OSSCs. However, OSSC-based phototransistors capable of dual-band spectral response remain a difficult challenge to achieve because organic semiconductors usually possess only narrow single band absorption. Here, we report the fabrication of high-performance, dual-band phototransistors from a hybrid structure of 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) single crystal array coated with CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by a simple, one-step solution method. In contrast to C8-BTBT and CH3NH3PbI3 NPs with respective absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) region, their hybrid structure shows broad absorption covering the entire UV-Vis range. The hybrid-based phototransistors exhibit ultrahigh responsivity of >1.72 \u00d7 104 A/W in the 252-780 nm region, which represents the best performance for solution-processing, broadband photodetectors. Moreover, integrated phototransistor circuitries from the hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 NPs/C8-BTBT single crystal array show application for high-security communication.",

        "abstract": "Nano-field-effect transistor (nano-FET)-based nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices fabricated from one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures have attracted much attention due to their superior memory performance. However, the construction of NVM devices is relatively complex due to the multi-step process needed to fabricate the trapping/tunneling layers. Here, we report a one-step fabrication of CdS:Mo\u2013CdMoO4 core\u2013shell nanoribbons (NRs) for high-performance nano-FET-based NVM devices. The CdMoO4 shell could serve as both the charge storage media and tunneling layer, thus greatly facilitating the device construction. The resultant NVM devices exhibited a large memory window of 60 V as well as a long retention time of 3600 s. Significantly, the devices showed an excellent resistance switching behavior with a current ON/OFF ratio as high as 106, which is larger than those of most 1D nanostructure-based nano-FET memories. A mechanism associated with defect states caused by oxygen vacancies in the CdMoO4 shell was proposed to interpret the memory characteristics. Given the excellent memory performance, along with the simple one-step fabrication process, CdS:Mo\u2013CdMoO4 NR-based NVM devices will have important applications in new-generation high-performance NVM devices.",

The impact of thermal treatment on the LID of a mc-Si PERC solar cell is investigated in this work. The LID of mc-Si PERC solar cells could be alleviated by lowering the peak temperature of thermal treatment (namely sintering), perhaps because fewer impurities present in mc-Si tended to dissolve into interstitial atoms, which have the tendency to form LeTID-related recombination active complexes. The LID could also be effectively restrained by partially replacing the boron dopant with gallium, which is ascribed to the decreased amount of boron\u2013oxygen (B\u2013O) complexes. This work provides a facile way to solve the severe LID problem in mc-Si PERC solar cells in mass production.",

However, for SiNx, a refractive index as low as about 1.40 cannot be achieved, which is the optimal value for the third layer of a triple-layer antireflection coating. Therefore, in this report the third layer is replaced by SiOx, which possesses a more appropriate refractive index of 1.46, it and can be easily integrated into the SiNx deposition process with the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. Through simulation and analysis with SunSolve, three different thicknesses were selected to construct the SiOx third layer. The replacement of 15 nm SiNx with 30 nm SiOx as the third layer of antireflection coating can bring about an efficiency gain of 0.15%, which originates from the reflectance reduction and spectral response enhancement below about 550 nm wavelength. However, because the EVA encapsulation material of the solar module absorbs light in short wavelengths, the spectral response advantage of solar cells with 30 nm SiOx is partially covered up, resulting in a slightly lower cell-to-module (CTM) ratio and an output power gain of only 0.9 W for solar module.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid nanostructures with combined functionalities can be rationally designed to achieve synergistic effects for efficient cancer treatment. Herein, a multifunctional nanoplatform is constructed, containing an inner core of an anticancer drug MTX surrounding by a nanometer-thin layer of gold as the shell with FeO magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) evenly distributed in the gold layer, and the outermost hybrid LA-PEG-MTX molecules as surface coating agent (denoted as MFG-LPM NPs). This nanocomposite possesses very high drug loading capacity as the entire core is MTX and integrates magnetic- and active- targeting drug delivery, light-controlled drug release, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as photothermal and chemotherapy. With a strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance at 808 nm, the nanocomposite enables temperature elevation and light-triggered MTX release. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicate that the strategy of combining therapy leads to a synergistic effect with high cancer cell killing efficacy. In consistency with this, due to the high accumulation of MFG-LPM NPs at tumor site and their combinatorial chemo-photothermal effects, 100% in vivo tumor elimination can be achieved. Additionally, in vivo MRI of tumor-bearing mice demonstrates an impressive performance of MFG-LPM NPs as a T contrast agent. Therefore, such multifunctional nanocomposite has the potential to serve as an excellent theranostic agent that collectively integrates multiple functions for efficient MRI guided cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Many drug molecules can be directly used as nanomedicine without the requirement of any inorganic or organic carriers such as silica and liposome nanostructures. This new type of carrier-free drug nanoparticles (NPs) has great potential in clinical treatment because of its ultra-high drug loading capacity and biodegradability. For practical applications, it is essential for such nanomedicine to possess robust stability and minimal premature release of therapeutic molecules during circulation in the blood stream. To meet this requirement, herein, we develop GSH-responsive and crosslinkable amphiphilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules to modify carrier-free drug NPs. These PEG molecules can be cross-linked on the surface of the NPs to endow them with greater stability and the cross-link is sensitive to intracellular environment for bio-responsive drug release. With this elegant design, our experimental results show that the liberation of DOX from DOX-cross-linked PEG NPs is dramatically slower than that from DOX-non-cross-linked PEG NPs, and the DOX release profile can be controlled by tuning the concentration of the reducing agent to break the cross-link between PEG molecules. More importantly, in vivo studies reveal that the DOX-cross-linked PEG NPs exhibit favorable blood circulation half-life (u003e4 h) and intense accumulation in tumor areas, enabling effective anti-cancer therapy. We expect this work will provide a powerful strategy for stabilizing carrier-free nanomedicines and pave the way to their successful clinical applications in the future.",

Both of these compounds have high thermal stabilities and show strong deep-blue emission as solid-state film as well as in  n -hexane solution. Two non-doped electroluminescent devices employing An-1 and An-2 as emitting layers were fabricated by vacuum vapor deposition. These devices exhibited highly efficient and stable deep-blue emission with high color purity. The CIE coordinate and maximum EQE of An-1 based device are 4.2% and (0.16, 0.06), respectively. Device based on An-2 achieved a maximum EQE of 4.0% and a CIE coordinate of (0.16, 0.10).",

By efficiency enhancement of the hybrid nanowire solar cells and a dual-functional titanium film serving as conjunct electrode of the solar cell and supercapacitor, the integrated system is able to yield a total photoelectric conversion to storage efficiency of 10.5%, which is the record value in all the integrated solar energy conversion and storage system. This system may not only serve as a buffer that diminishes the solar power fluctuations from light intensity, but also pave its way toward cost-effective high efficiency self-charging power unit. Finally, an integrated device based on ultrathin Si substrate is demonstrated to expand its feasibility and potential application in flexible energy conversion and storage devices.",

        "abstract": "SummaryBecause of the exponential growth of mobile usersu0027 demand for multimedia services in recent years, the increasing network traffic load gets a close attention of the mobile network operators. For the mobile traffic explosion issue to be solved, there are many efforts trying to offload the mobile traffic from infrastructure cellular links to direct local short-range communications among groups of users, which is called device-to-device sharing (D2D) in mobile social networks. Although there have been a number of studies for improving the exploitation of friends, contents, and sharing performance, there is no any large-scale measurement-based study to analyze the realistic D2D sharing service. We focus on the empirical trace from Xender, a popular mobile application for D2D sharing, and implement an effective big data processing platform based on Spark with customized algorithms. Extensive analysis and discussions are carried out from the perspectives of general time series statistics, content properties, and social graph basics. The trace-driven analysis exploits a number of implications regarding power law distribution for content popularity disparity, clustering effects of user relationships, and so on. We further discuss the potentials of improving Xenderu0027s quality of service and optimizing its system resource, and hopefully, our study can offer useful guidelines for not only Xender but also those growing global social D2D sharing services.",

        "abstract": "LIM homeobox transcription factor 1, alpha (LMX1A) is downregulated in human gastric cancer (GC), functioning as a tumor suppressor. The current study aims to identify specific microRNA that can regulate LMX1A expression. By sequence analysis of LMX1A mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), we show that microRNA-9 (miR-9) putatively targets human LMX1A. In established (AGS cells) and primary human GC cells, ectopic overexpression of miR-9 by a lentiviral construct decreased LMX1A 3'-UTR activity, causing LMX1A mRNA and protein downregulation. Functional analyses show that miR-9 overexpression enhanced GC cell survival and proliferation. On the contrary, miR-9 inhibition by antagomir-9 lentivirus increased LMX1A 3'-UTR activity to upregulate LMX1A mRNA and protein expression, causing GC cell apoptosis. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated LMX1A knockout promoted AGS cell survival and proliferation. Importantly, miR-9 and antagomiR-9 were ineffective to the function of LMX1A-knockout AGS cells. In human GC tissues miR-9 is upregulated, which is negatively correlated with LMX1A downregulation. Together, we conclude that miR-9 selectively targets LMX1A to promote GC cell progression.",

        "abstract": "Activins are members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Previous studies have shown that activin A may have a central role in regulating both apoptosis and proliferation. However, direct studies of recombination human activin A on human NSCLC A549 cells have not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether activin A could induce apoptosis in A549 cells and the possible mechanisms via which it worked.Cellular apoptosis induced by activin A was detected by TUNEL assay and the levels of protein expression were detected by western blot.Recombination human activin A induced apoptosis in human NSCLC A549 cells in a concentrate-dependent manner. Activin A-induced A549 apoptosis was accompanied by the up-regulation of Bax, Bad and Bcl-Xs and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, activin A treatment increased the expression of its typeII receptors, activated ERK and caspase 3 in A549. These results clearly demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis by activin-A involves multiple cellular/molecular pathways and strongly suggest that pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and caspase 3 participate in activin A-induced apoptotic process in A549 cells. On the other hand, activin A treatment had little effect on primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs).Recombination human activin A induced apoptosis in A549 cells, at least partially, through ERK and mitochondrial pathway. The result that activin A did not affect the normal SAEC revealed activin A might be considered as a potential anticancer agent and worthy of further studies.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel concept to develop two fluorophors 2-(10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)thianthrene 5,5,10,10-tetraoxide (PTZ-TTR) and 2-(4-(10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)phenyl)thianthrene 5,5,10,10-tetraoxide (PTZ-Ph-TTR) showing dual conformations for highly efficient single-emitter white organic-light emitting diodes (WOLEDs). Both molecules exist in two stable conformations. Their nearly-orthogonal forms own lower energy levels and show thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic, while their nearly-planar conformers possess higher energy levels and show only prompt fluorescence. These dual conformers were exploited for fabricating WOLEDs with complementary emission colors contributing by the two conformations. Moreover, the originally wasted triplet energy on the nearly-planar conformation can be transferred to the nearly-orthogonal one, then harvested via the TADF channel, realizing full exciton utilization. A PTZ-TTR-based single-emitter device exhibits standard white emission with a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.33) and a high color rendering index value of 92. On the other hand, the PTZ-Ph-TTR-based single-emitter device realizes an emission approach-ing warm white light and high maximum external quantum efficiency of 16.34%. These results demonstrate an alternative approach for designing high performance WOLEDs based on single TADF emitters.",

By adjusting the linking position of the two electron-deficient benzonitrile arms from a  meta -position to an  ortho -position with the cyano core, the LUMO energy levels of mPTBC and oPTBC are varied to\u00a0\u22122.98 and\u00a0\u22123.13\u00a0eV, respectively; while the HOMO energy levels remain similar. In devices, the new TADF emitters successfully exhibit similar maximum efficiencies, but different-color emissions with a spectral peak at 516\u00a0nm for mPTBC and a spectral peak at 540\u00a0nm for oPTBC. These results prove the simple modification of adjusting the linking position of electron-deficient substituent groups in the molecules can effectively fine-tune the emissions of TADF emitters but without significantly changing other key performance.",

        "abstract": "Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on carbazole groups have been reported to realize different efficiencies in devices. Herein, we report two carbazole-based TADF emitters, namely 2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)thianthrene 5,5,10,10-tetraoxide (CZ-TTR), which has one free-rotation carbazole, and 2,3-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)thianthrene 5,5,10,10-tetraoxide (DCZ-TTR), which has two mutually restricted carbazole groups, and investigated the influence of steric hindrance on their properties. Both compounds employed the same donor and acceptor segments and connecting mode. However, due to steric hindrance between the two carbazole segments, DCZ-TTR exhibited a smaller singlet\u2013triplet splitting of 0.03 eV compared with that of CZ-TTR (0.10 eV). The device containing DCZ-TTR showed significantly higher efficiencies (20.1% for external quantum efficiency (EQE), 58.5 lm W\u22121 for power efficiency (PE), and 59.6 cd A\u22121 for current efficiency (CE)) than those of the CZ-TTR-based device (EQE = 14.4%; PE = 32.9 lm W\u22121; CE = 32.5 cd A\u22121). These results clearly proved the necessity of introducing suitable steric hindrance when designing highly efficient TADF emitters based on carbazole groups.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   High efficiency, high color rendering index (CRI) and excellent color-stability are important requirements for high-performance white organic light emitting diodes (WOLEDs). To realize these issues for the WOLEDs based on the full thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) system, we constructed WOLED devices by employing CDBP:PO-T2T exciplex as the host, while 2CzPN and AnbTPA as blue and red dopants, respectively. We carefully optimize the device to realize balanced carrier transporting property of each emitting layer and good exciton confinement in the device. As a result, the WOLED achieves stable white emission with a high CRI of 82, a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.38) at a luminance of 1000\u00a0cd\u00a0m \u22122 , and a small CIE variation value of (0.00, 0.02) in the luminance range of 100\u20133000\u00a0cd\u00a0m \u22122 . It also demonstrates high maximum forward-viewing external quantum efficiency of 19.2%, current efficiency of 36.7\u00a0cd\u00a0A \u22121  and power efficiency of 46.2\u00a0lm\u00a0W \u22121 . Our work presents a novel and useful approach to develop highly efficient, color-stable and high-CRI WOLEDs through the full TADF mechanism.",

Both molecules exist in two stable conformations. Their nearly orthogonal forms own lower energy levels and show thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, whereas their nearly planar conformers possess higher energy levels and show only prompt fluorescence. These dual conformers were exploited for fabricating WOLEDs with complementary emission colors contributed by the two conformations. Moreover, the originally wasted triplet energy on the nearly planar conformation can be transferred to the nearly orthogonal one and then harvested via the TADF channel, realizing full exciton utilization.

With the effective superimposed resonance effect from electron-deficient carbonyls and electron-rich nitrogen atom, both emitters realize significant TADF characteristics with small \u0394ESTs of 0.18 and 0.19 eV respectively. And molecular relaxations were dramatically suppressed for both emitters because of their conjugated structure. In the devices, 3-PhQAD realizes superior performance with a maximum EQE of 19.1% and a narrow full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 44 nm, while a maximum EQE of 18.7% and an extremely narrow FWHM of 34 nm are realized for 7-PhQAD. These superior results reveal that apart from nitrogen and boron-aromatic systems, QAD framework can also act as a TADF matrix with effective resonance effect, and QAD derivatives are ideal candidate to develop TADF emitters with narrow FWHMs for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Development of red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters has been falling behind comparing with those of blue and green fluorophores, especially for solution-processable ones. In this work, two novel orange-red TADF emitters 3,6-di(10H-phenoxazin-10-yl)dibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DBPZ-DPXZ) and 10,10'-(11,12-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)dibenzo[a,c]phenazine-3,6-diyl)bis(10H-phenoxazine) (tDBBPZ-DPXZ) are developed. A high-performance orange-red TADF emitter, DBPZ-DPXZ, is first prepared by connecting a rigid acceptor and two rigid donor segments. While this design strategy endows DBPZ-DPXZ with excellent TADF performance leading to a vacuum-processed organic light-emitting diode (OLED) with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.8%, the rigid segments limit its solubility and applications in solution-processed devices. Based on this prototype, tDBBPZ-DPXZ is designed with the addition of 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl groups to boost its solubility with barely influence on the photophysical properties. In particular, tDBBPZ-DPXZ maintains nearly identical photoluminescence quantum yield of 83% and singlet-triplet energy splitting of 0.03 eV with EQE of 17.0% in a vacuum-processed orange-red OLED. Furthermore, it can be applied on the orange-red solution-processed OLED realizing an EQE as high as 10.1%, representing one of the state-of-the-art results of the reported orange-red solution-processed TADF-OLEDs. This work provides an effective strategy to address the conflicting requirements between high efficiency and good solubility and develop efficient soluble orange-red TADF emitters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have attracted much interest in recent years for their great potential in full exciton utilization. However, the lack of electron-donor candidates limits further development of TADF emitters. In this study, a novel electron-donor segment 13,13-dimethyl-5-phenyl-11,13-dihydro-5 H -indolo[2,3- b ]acridine (IDAC) is newly developed to construct TADF emitters. Due to the suitable steric hindrance and large planar rigid structures, IDAC derivatives could easily obtain small energy differences (\u0394 E  ST s) between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states for effective TADF characteristics as well as high photoluminance quantum yields. Two novel TADF emitters, 6-(13,13-dimethyl-5-phenyl-5,13-dihydro-11 H -indolo[2,3- b ] acridin-11-yl)-3-methyl-1H-isochromen-1-one (IDAC-MCO) and 11-(4-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)phenyl)-13,13-dimethyl-5-phenyl-11,13-dihydro-5 H -indolo[2,3- b ]acridine (IDAC-Trz), are accordingly designed and synthesized, and both exhibit evident TADF characteristics with small \u0394 E  ST s of 0.09 and 0.02\u202feV and high photoluminance quantum yields of 81% and 90%, respectively. The OLEDs using IDAC-MCO and IDAC-Trz as emitters respectively achieve high external quantum efficiencies of 18.0% and 20.5% with remarkable low efficiency roll-offs. These results demonstrate the capacity of IDAC segment as an ideal electron-donor to construct efficient TADF emitters.",

        "abstract": "Laser-induced deterioration was proposed for the wet grinding of zirconium oxide (ZrO2) ceramic used in the dental, semiconductor and automotive industries. The mechanisms for laser induced deterioration and wet grinding of the deterioration layer were theoretically analysed, and the four key processing parameters that determine the micro-topography and distribution of the laser-induced crater were proposed, including the laser power density Ip, the defocus distance z, the laser spot overlap ratio Us and the laser scanning track line overlap ratio Ul. Further, the forming mechanism of the single pulse-induced crater under different laser power densities, the defocus distance, and the interaction mechanisms between adjacent spots along the longitudinal and transverse directions were investigated. The optimal values of the key processing parameters were identified. To further evaluate the effect of laser-induced deterioration objectively, a comparative experiment was conducted under laser-induced deterioration wet grinding (LIDWG) and conventional grinding (CG) conditions. It was found that the procedure of laser-induced deterioration had a strong influence on the grinding results. The normal and tangential grinding forces for LIDWG condition were lower than for CG condition, with a maximum reduction of 59.2% (62.9%).",

        "abstract": "By introducing two novel electron-donating (D) moieties dibenzothiophene (DBT) and dibenzofuran (DBF) as the secondary D groups, we designed and synthesized four novel blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters DBTCz-Trz, DBFCz-Trz, BDBTCz-Trz and BDBFCz-Trz. The secondary DBF and DBT segments all significantly participated in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) delocalization, resulting in effective TADF characteristics and high photoluminescence quantum yields simultaneously for all four emitters. In the devices, DBTCz-Trz and DBFCz-Trz successfully exhibit identical blue emission with a peak at 472 nm and a CIE coordinate of (0.17, 0.28) in the devices, while BDBTCz-Trz and BDBFCz-Trz exhibit cyan emissions. Moreover, the maximum forward-viewing external quantum efficiencies are determined to be as high as 21.7% for DBTCz-Trz, 21.6% for DBFCz-Trz, 23.4% for BDBTCz-Trz, and 25.1% for BDBFCz-Trz, respectively. These results not only prove the great potential of amine-free electron-donating components such as DBF and DBT in constructing TADF emitters for electroluminescence, but they also reveal the importance of extending the frontier orbital molecular distributions for TADF molecular optimization.",

        "abstract": "The developing of red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which are attainable for both high-efficient red organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and non-doped deep red/near-infrared (NIR) OLEDs, is full of challenge. In this work, two novel red emitters, BPPZ-PXZ and mDPBPZ-PXZ, with highly twisted donor-acceptor structures are designed and synthesized to study molecular design strategies of high-efficiency red TADF emitter for different applications. BPPZ-PXZ employs the strictest molecular restrictions to suppress energy loss and realizes red emission with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (\u03a6PL) of 100 \u00b1 0.8% and remarkable external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.2% in doped OLED. While its non-doped OLED only shows a low EQE of 2.5% due to its unavoidable intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction. On the other hand, mDPBPZ-PXZ releases two pyridine substituents out of its fused acceptor moiety as steric hindrance to suppress intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction. Though mDPBPZ-PXZ realizes a slight lower EQE of 21.7% in the doped OLED; its non-doped device shows a superior EQE of 5.2% with deep red/NIR emission at peak of 680 nm. The two emitters show leading performances among respectively doped red TADF OLEDs and non-doped deep red/NIR ones. This work demonstrates new insight for designing high-efficiency TADF emitters for doped red OLEDs and non-doped deep red/NIR OLEDs.",

        "abstract": "The combination of diagnostic and therapeutic functions in a single theranostic nanoagent generally requires the integration of multi-ingredients. Herein, a cytotoxic near-infrared (NIR) dye (IR-797) and its nanoassembly are reported for multifunctional cancer theranostics. The hydrophobic IR-797 molecules are self-assembled into nanoparticles, which are further modified with an amphiphilic polymer (C18PMH-PEG5000) on the surface. The prepared PEG-IR-797 nanoparticles (PEG-IR-797 NPs) possess inherent cytotoxicity from the IR-797 dye and work as a chemotherapeutic drug which induces apoptosis of cancer cells. The IR-797 NPs are found to have an ultrahigh mass extinction coefficient (444.3 L g cm at 797 nm and 385.9 L g cm at 808 nm) beyond all reported organic nanomaterials (<40 L g cm ) for superior photothermal therapy (PTT). In addition, IR-797 shows some aggregation-induced-emission (AIE) properties. Combining the merits of good NIR absorption, high photothermal energy conversion efficiency, and AIE, makes the PEG-IR-797 NPs useful for multimodal NIR AIE fluorescence, photoacoustic, and thermal imaging-guided therapy. The research exhibits the possibility of using a single ingredient and entity to perform multimodal NIR fluorescence, photoacoustic, and thermal imaging-guided chemo-/photothermal combination therapy, which may trigger wide interest from the fields of nanomedicine and medicinal chemistry to explore multifunctional theranostic organic molecules.",

An anolyte based on aprotic Zn deep-eutectic-solvent, which uses low cost, abundant and environmentally benign materials, exhibits a utilizable concentration of Zn ca. 1.7\u2009M, resulting in a reversible volumetric capacity of ca. 90\u2009A\u2009h\u00b7L. Combined with high efficiencies and relatively low redox potential of -1.12\u2009V vs. Ag/AgCl, such an anolyte provides an alternative way to explore a family of anolytes using new chemistries for rechargeable Zn batteries that meet the criteria for grid-scale electrical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Organic redox compounds represent an emerging class of active materials for organic redox-flow batteries (RFBs), which are highly desirable for sustainable electrical energy storage. The structural diversity of organic redox compounds helps in tuning the electrochemical properties as compared to the case of their inorganic counterparts. However, the structural diversity makes the design and identification of redox-active organic materials difficult because it is challenging to achieve appropriate redox potential, solubility and stability together, which are the major concerns regarding the practical applicability of these materials to RFBs. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and application of viologen molecules as anolyte materials for organic RFBs that are compatible with Li-ion electrolytes. Structural screening assisted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggests that the (CH2)5CH3-substituted viologen molecule exhibits reduction potential as low as 2.74 V vs. Li/Li+, good structural stability due to effective charge delocalization within the two pyridinium rings, and a solubility of up to 1.3 M in carbonate-based electrolytes. When paired with a 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2032\u2032-terpyridine\u2013iron complex catholyte, the cell shows a high discharge voltage of 1.3\u20131.5 V with coulombic efficiency u003e 98% and energy efficiency u003e 84%. Both the anolyte and catholyte materials are built from earth-abundant elements and can be produced with high yields; thus, they may represent a promising choice for sustainable electrical energy storage.",

However, the low redox potential and chemical bond cleavage/recombination during lithiation/delithiation have significantly limited their practical application. We demonstrate here the manipulation of conjugation to stabilize N redox-active centers in a p-type, two-electron-transfer oligomer of  N , N \u2019-diphenyl-5,10-dihydrophenazine as a high-voltage organic battery cathode material, which exhibits high redox potentials of 4.1 and 3.3\u202fV (vs. Li + /Li), good stability, and a galvanometric energy density of ca. 530\u202fWh\u202fkg \u20131 . The redox active electron localized on the dihydrophenazine unit in this oligomer are believed to contribute to the good electrochemical performances.",

Here, we report green and effective eutectic-based anolytes to achieve enhanced reversibility and high concentration through phthalimide derivatives. A nearly 6-fold increase in solubility can be achieved with the eutectic electrolytes composed of phthalimide derivatives, urea, and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The interaction between phthalimide derivatives and LiTFSI weakens the chemical bonds, facilitating the formation of eutectic electrolytes. Meanwhile, urea contributes to decreasing the viscosity of the eutectic solvent as well as to improving the reversibility of phthalimide radical anions generated during the electrochemical process. Compared with previously reported organic redox flow batteries, the resulting redox flow battery demonstrates comparable storage capacity but superior cycling stability, showing the promise of the eutectic-phthalimide-based organic molecules for high-performance organic redox flow\u00a0batteries.",

The alkali salt of 4,4'-(phenazine-5,10-diyl)dibenzoate allows facile transport of cations as well as large anions, and remains stable in both oxidized and reduced states. The large potential difference between phenazine and benzoate results in a high cell voltage of 2.5 V, and an energy density of 127 W h kg-1 at a current rate of 1 C. The introducing of bipolar organic materials may further consolidate the development of symmetric batteries that are fabricated from elemental abundant and environmentally friendly materials.",

The performance of current electrical energy storage technologies falls well short of requirements for using electrical energy efficiently in transportation, commercial, and residential applications. This paper explores the possibility by using transition-metal-based complexes as active materials in a Li-ion battery full cell that synergizes the concept of both lithium-ion batteries and redox flow batteries. A cathode made from transition metal complex, [Fe(bpy)3](BF4)2, exhibits high discharge voltage approaching 4 V (vs Li/Li+). When coupled with a Li4Ti5O12 anode, the Li-ion full battery exhibits a cell voltage exceeding 2.2 V and decent cycling efficiencies with Coulombic efficiency and energy/voltage efficiencies above 99% and 92%/93%, respectively. Such a Li-ion battery full cell offers distinct features such as low cost and flexibility in molecular structure design. The result reveals a generic design route toward iron-based complexes as cathode materials with good electrochemical performances.",

Moreover, the redox potential could be internally regulated through the tuning of \u03c3 and \u03c0 bonding contribution at the redox-active sites. Furthermore, the binding geometry of some selected quinone derivatives with metal cations was studied. These studies provide an alternative strategy to identify and design new quinone molecules with suitable redox potentials for electrical energy storage in organic RFBs.",

However, their implementation is challenged by the cyclability, which is an order of magnitude lower than traditional redox flow batteries using inorganic redox couples. The unsatisfactory cyclability mainly arises from electrolyte contamination and irreversible losses of active material in the electrolyte. To address such issues, a highly water-soluble artificial bipolar molecule containing cathode-active ferrocene moiety and anode-active bipyridinium moiety is realized and used as the sole active material in a symmetric organic redox flow cell. Owing to the good reversibility, minimum electrolyte contamination, and stability of the synthesized molecule, the demonstrated cell boosts the cyclability to 4000 cycles with capacity retention of ca. 75% at 100% depth of discharge, which fills in the gap of cyclability between organic redox flow batteries and conventional redox flow batteries.",

        "abstract": "Redox-active polymers are promising materials for rechargeable batteries because of their structural diversity and resource sustainability. We present in this work the feasibility of manipulation of the rigidity of polymer chains to alter the ion diffusion behaviour in polymeric materials. The results indicate that the ionic diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude if a proper twisted group is introduced to interrupt the rigid backbone of the polymers. Both greater galvanometric and volumetric power/energy densities have been achieved for the polymer with more flexible chains, regardless of its lower surface area and electrical conductivity compared to the one with a more rigid chain structure. Such a strategy might be useful for the design of polymeric battery materials with high power density without sacrificing the volumetric energy density.",

Herein, an aluminum-based deep-eutectic-solvent is investigated as an anolyte for redox-flow batteries. The aluminum-based deep-eutectic solvent demonstrated a significantly enhanced concentration of circa 3.2\u2009m in the anolyte and a relatively low redox potential of 2.2\u2005V vs. Li /Li. The electrochemical measurements highlight that a reversible volumetric capacity of 145\u2005Ah\u2009L and an energy density of 189\u2005Wh\u2009L or 165\u2005Wh\u2009kg have been achieved when coupled with a I /I catholyte. The prototype cell has also been extended to the use of a Br -based catholyte, exhibiting a higher cell voltage with a theoretical energy density of over 200\u2005Wh\u2009L . The synergy of highly abundant, dendrite-free, multi-electron-reaction aluminum anodes and environmentally benign deep-eutectic-solvent anolytes reveals great potential towards cost-effective, sustainable redox-flow batteries.",

Photoelectrodes driving nonspontaneous reversible redox reactions in solar-powered redox cells (SPRCs), which can deliver energy via the corresponding reverse reactions, present a cost-effective and promising approach for direct solar energy harvesting and storage. However, the lack of photoelectrodes having both high conversion efficiency and high durability becomes a bottleneck that hampers practical applications of SPRCs. Here, it is shown that a WO -decorated BiVO photoanode, without the need of extra electrocatalysts, can enable a single-photocatalyst-driven SPRC with a solar-to-output energy conversion efficiency as high as 1.25%. This SPRC presents stable performance over 20 solar energy storage/delivery cycles. The high efficiency and stability are attributed to the rapid redox reactions, the well-matched energy level, and the efficient light harvesting and charge separation of the prepared BiVO . This demonstrated device system represents a potential alternative toward the development of low-cost, durable, and easy-to-implement solar energy technologies.",

We demonstrate here the direct solar energy harvesting and storage in a rechargeable solar-powered redox cell, which can be charged solely by solar irradiation. The cell follows a conventional redox-flow cell design with one integrated TiO2 photoanode in the cathode side. Direct charging the cell by solar irradiation results in the conversion of solar energy in to chemical energy. While discharging the cell leads to the release of chemical energy in the form of electricity. The cell integrates energy conversion and storage processes in a single device, making the solar energy directly and efficiently dispatchable. When using redox couples of Br2/Br- and I3-/I- in the cathode side and anode side, respectively, the cell can be directly charged upon solar irradiation, yielding a discharge potential of 0.5V with good round-trip efficiencies. This design is expected to be a potential alternative towards the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies.",

To start with, the blending energy distribution and Huggins parameters have been calculated, indicating fine miscibility between GAP matrix and both plasticizers. The solubility parameter and binding energies show better compatibility between Bu-NENA and GAP matrix than BDNPF/A, owing to stronger interactions. The interaction mechanism includes both hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. The low field NMR physical crosslink density and dynamic rheological behaviors imply larger disentanglement effect of Bu-NENA in GAP matrix. The dynamic mechanical performance of elastomers show lower glass transition temperature of GAP/Bu-NENA blends, as supportive proof of stronger interactions between GAP matrix and Bu-NENA in comparison with BDNPF/A.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To realize high-performance red organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), a novel exciplex system Tris-PCz:B4PyPPM with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic was developed as the host of both red fluorescent and phosphorescent emitters. Due to the blue-green PL spectrum and suitable triplet energy level of 2.53\u00a0eV, the exciplex system matches the requirements of both red fluorescent and phosphorescent dopants. With an optimized mixing molar ratio of 5:5, Tris-PCz:B4PyPPM exciplex system shows outstanding host performance in both the red fluorescent and phosphorescent devices. The red fluorescent device based on DCJTB exhibits a low turn-on voltage of 2.3\u00a0V and an extremely high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.3%. And the red phosphorescent device with the Ir(MDQ) 2 acac as the emitter realizes a maximum EQE of 20.3%. These remarkable results prove the feasibility of TADF exciplex systems simultaneously as the hosts of both high-performance fluorescent and phosphorescent red devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Solvent additives have been considered as a simple and efficient method to increase the performance of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells, in which, the morphology of the active layer could obtain further improvements by using the binary solvent additives. In this paper, a series of brominated compounds, 1-Bromo-4-butylbenzene (Brbb), 1-Bromo-4- n -hexylbenzene (Brbh) and 1-Bromo-4- n -octylbenzene (Brbo), have been respectively incorporated with 1, 8-diiodooctane (DIO) and regarded as binary solvent additives to fabricate highly efficient bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). Compared with the BHJ film based on single additive, the binary additives contained BHJ film shows increased optical absorption, efficient charge transport and better active layer morphology, leading to an enhancement of short-circuit current (J SC ) together with a higher achieved fill factor (FF). The conventional BHJ device using PTB7: PC 71 BM or PTB7-th: PC 71 BM with the binary solvent additives exhibit enhanced PCE of 8.13% and 10.31%, respectively, which is much higher than that of single additive based devices (7.04% for PTB7 and 8.73% for PTB7-th). The optimized performance of BHJ devices indicates that these brominated compounds are promising additives to improve device efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Ternary blend systems have been used to enhance the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it is still a challenge to find suitable third components that concurrently possess complementary light absorption and well-matched energy levels. Here, a small organic molecule, 4,4'-(9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-(pyren-1-yl)phenyl)anili-ne) (DFNPy), which contains a triphenylamine core and bulky pyrene rings, was designed and used to construct ternary blend OSCs. DFNPy shows complementary absorption spectra in the 350-450 nm shortwave band, which has seldom been reported in the field of ternary OSCs. Furthermore, the bulky pyrene rings aggregate via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking to promote charge transfer. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.59% with an enhanced JSC of 19.72 mA cm-2 was realized in PTB7-Th:DFNPy:PC71BM-based ternary OSCs. The addition of DFNPy was found to modulate the film morphology by improving the film phase separation and crystallinity, which can facilitate charge generation and decrease charge recombination, resulting in enhanced mobility. The results demonstrate an effective strategy for improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.",

However, their applications are greatly restricted by the difficulty of tuning different optical properties within the same material, especially by a single stimulus. Here, magnetic modulations of multiple optical properties are demonstrated in a crystalline colloidal array (CCA) of magnetic nanorods. Small-angle X-ray scattering studies reveal that these nanorods form an unusual monoclinic crystal in concentrated suspensions. The CCA exhibits optical anisotropy in the form of a photonic bandgap and birefringence, thus enabling magnetic tuning of the structural color and transmittance at a rate of 50 Hz. As a proof-of-concept, it is further demonstrated that the fabrication of a multifunctional device for display, anticounterfeiting, and smart-window applications based on this multiple magneto-optical effect. The study not only provides a new model system for understanding colloidal assembly, but also opens up opportunities for new applications of smart optical materials for various purposes.",

To address this, two multifunctional deep-blue materials 4-{2-[4\u2032-(1,4,5-triphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-biphenyl-4-yl]-3a,11b-dihydro-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-1-yl}-benzonitrile (CPD) and 4-(2-{4\u2032-[1-(4-tert-butyl-phenyl)-4,5-diphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-biphenyl-4-yl}-3a,11b-dihydro-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-1-yl)-benzonitrile (tCPD) based on phenanthroimidazole units are designed, synthesized, and characterized. Both the materials show high quantum yields and good stabilities. The deep-blue fluorescent devices using CPD and tCPD as emitters show maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.80% and 4.71% along with Commission Internationale de Iu0027Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.15, 0.07) and (0.15, 0.09), respectively. Two-color based WOLEDs are demonstrated by doping Ir(MDQ)2acac into CPD and tCPD with a low doping concentration, both devices show high EQEs of 16.4% and 16.6% and CIEs of (0.49, 0.34) and (0.48, 0.32), respectively. Furthermore, three-color based fluorescence/phosphorescence-WOLEDs (F/P-WOLEDs), with reasonable exciton management, are fabricated to enhance exciton utilization and improve device performance. CPD-based WOLED shows high efficiencies of 49.4 cd A\u22121, 53.5 lm W\u22121, 19.0%, and CIE coordinate of (0.46, 0.46). With the same structure, tCPD-based device also shows high efficiencies of 40.6 cd A\u22121, 47.2 lm W\u22121, 19.4% along with CIE coordinate of (0.43, 0.45). These results are among the best of reported deep-blue OLEDs and F/P-WOLEDs.",

        "abstract": "A novel diphenylimidazole derivative (PTN), which shows strong excimer emission, has been designed and utilized in organic solar cells (OSCs). The extended solid-state excimer emission facilitates intra-system self-absorption and accelerates photon trapping in OSCs. The ternary OSC based on PTB7-Th:PTN:PC71BM using a green solvent (ethylbenzene) exhibits a high PCE of 11.44%, which is 28.40% higher than that of the binary device (8.91%). The great enhancement is mainly ascribed to the increased self-absorption in the system. Furthermore, the well-organized stacking of PTN is beneficial to promote overlap between small molecules and polymers and then accelerates intermolecular energy transfer. The most important thing to note is that ternary OSCs fabricated both with halogen and nonhalogen solvents show better air, thermal and light irradiation stability, compared with the control device. Over 55 days of air storage, the PCE of the unpackaged ternary OSC still remains at 76%, whereas the control device becomes inefficient. The performance is among the best results for both efficiency and stability in PTB7-Th:PC71BM based solar cells, which can narrow the gap between laboratory investigations and industrial production.",

        "abstract": "There has been growing interest in the preparation of anisotropic magnetic nanoparticles with well-controlled shapes and excellent colloidal dispersity. Here we report a general and mild approach for the preparation of highly dispersible anisotropic magnetic colloids through the low-temperature conversion of nonmagnetic templates. The key of our strategy is to modify the template surface with a layer of porous silica to provide a spatially confined environment necessary for the preservation of the overall morphology and improve the shell permeability necessary for the conversion at lower temperatures. The conversion under milder conditions not only is of practical importance for improving energy and cost-effectiveness but also produces magnetic particles with excellent colloidal dispersity by alleviating aggregation. We demonstrate the universality of this approach in the porous-silica-protected conversion of different samples including \u03b1-Fe2O3 and FeOOH into anisotropic magnetic particles with excellent colloidal dispersity. Based on highly dispersible anisotropic magnetic particles, we also demonstrate the fabrication of responsive photonic crystals for detecting very weak magnetic fields that are one order of magnitude higher than the earth magnetic field. Our study paves the way for new applications of anisotropic magnetic nanoparticles in self-assembly, catalysis, photonic crystals, liquid crystals, biomedicine and pharmaceutics.",

        "abstract": "Incorporation of a ternary organic component is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a small molecule luminescent dye, C545T, was first doped into blends of PTB7-Th/PC71BM and PTB7/PC71BM as a third component to fabricate ternary OSCs. It is demonstrated that C545T can disrupt the severe vertical distribution in the binary blend and effectively modulate the novel surface chemical configuration by improving the self-assembly process of the polymer donor, as a result of the good miscibility among the active layer materials and the \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between PC71BM and C545T. The obtained homogeneously bicontinuous BHJ with numerous interpenetrating nanofibers optimizes the domain size of exciton diffusion and the length of charge transfer. The energy transfer between C545T and polymers changes the transmission path of photo-generated excitons, which together improve the exciton dissociation process and reduce the recombination loss. Champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10.69% and 9.42% were achieved by the ternary blends of PTB7-Th/C545T/PC71BM and PTB7/C545T/PC71BM, respectively, which correspond to a nearly 20% enhancement over their binary counterparts.",

        "abstract": "To make nanomedicine potentially applicable in clinic, several methods have been developed to synthesize pure nanodrugs (PNDs) without using any additional inert carriers. In this work, we report a novel green, low-cost and scalable ice-template-assisted approach which shows several unique characteristics. Firstly, the whole process only requires adding drug solution into an ice template and subsequent melting (or freeze-drying), allowing easy industrial mass production with low capital investment. Secondly, the production yield is much higher than that of the traditional reprecipitation approach. The yield of Curcumin (Cur) PNDs is over two orders (~ 140 times) magnitude higher than that obtained in a typical reprecipitation preparation. By adjusting simple processing parameters, PNDs with different sizes (~ 20-200 nm) can be controllably obtained. Finally, the present approach can be easily applicable for a wide range of hydrophobic therapeutic drugs without any structural modification.",

        "abstract": "Charge transport materials play a crucial role in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their effect on reducing the operating voltage and enhancing the power efficiency. To develop hole transport materials with improved hole-mobility, two novel bromine-substituted triphenylamine derivatives: ((4-bromo-phenyl)-bis-(4-quinolin-8-yl-phenyl)-amine) Br-DQTPA and (9,9-bis-(4-triphenyl-amine)-2,7-dibromo-9H-fluorene) Br-DTF were designed and synthesized. The hole mobilities of Br-DQTPA and Br-DTF show one order of magnitude enhancement compared with non-brominated (phenyl-bis-(4-quinolin-8-yl-phenyl)-amine) DQTPA and (9,9-bis-(4-triphenyl-amine)-9H-fluorene) DTF under the same electric field. Attributed to their improved hole mobilities, traditional green phosphorescent OLEDs that use Br-DQTPA or Br-DTF as a hole transport material both show an ultralow operating voltage at 1 cd m\u22122 (below 2.4 V) and very high luminous efficiencies (over 21% and 90 lm W\u22121) without light outcoupling improvement. Those results are much better than those of DQTPA-, DTF-, and even NPB-based green devices, indicating that bromine-substitution is a promising and convenient way to achieve novel hole transport materials with improved hole-mobility.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The strategy for introducing agents into active layer has been studied as an effective and simple method for optimizing the film morphology and enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Whereas very few agents can be efficient used and make contribution in non-fullerene OSCs. In this work, two novel non-ionic surfactants 1, 8-Octanediol (ODO) and 1, 10-Decanediol (DDO) were introduced to realize high efficiency opaque and semitransparent non-fullerene OSCs for the first time. Doped with an appropriate amount of ODO and DDO in PTB7-Th: ITIC system, highly efficient opaque solar cells have been achieved with a power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 10.28% and 9.59%, respectively, which exhibited a huge improvement compared with reference cells (PCE of 7.84%). A performance increase is owing to the improvements in short-circuit current density (J SC ) and fill factor (FF) via the optimization of the film morphology and the enhanced crystallinity of polymer after adding the surfactant. By using a transparent electrode, the semitransparent OSC shows PCE of 7.74% with high average visible transmittance (AVT) of 21.35%. Moreover, both the stability and efficiency of the OSCs were obviously enhanced by adding the surfactants of ODO and DDO compared with the traditional solvent additives (DIO, CN). Our work clearly expressed that add small amount of non-ionic surfactants could be a simple and efficient strategy to improve the performance of the OSCs.",

This process involves the coating of hydrophilic nanoparticles with a layer of linear-chained polystyrene through seeded emulsion polymerization and a subsequent dissolution of polystyrene layer by toluene. Since one end of the linear polystyrene chain is covalently bonded to the particle surface which provides strong steric stabilization, the transferred nanoparticles exhibit superior dispersity and long-term colloidal stability in many nonpolar and polar aprotic solvents. Moreover, the present approach allows for the storage of transferred nanoparticles in a powder form which can be completely re-dispersed in solvents before the usage. Based on this strategy, we demonstrate the phase transfer of Au nanorods and nanospheres, silica, titania and resorcinol-formaldehyde spheres, which just represents a few examples of transferrable hydrophilic nanoparticles with different morphologies, sizes, compositions, functions and surface properties. This general and robust phase transfer protocol will greatly facilitate the applications of hydrophilic nanoparticle in organic catalysis, optoelectronics, energy storage and conversion, and organic light emitting diodes.",

Contradictory to common impressions, we found that the ionic permeability of silica shells increased rather than decreased with the increasing aging degree. This trend may be explained by the chemical nature of the sol\u2013gel silica shell that affects the wettability and, thereby, the transportation of water molecules and hydrated ions. Our study provides novel insights into the protective ability of sol\u2013gel derived silica, which enables us to design thin but low-permeability shells for the stability of inner nanoparticles under harsh conditions without scarifying the performance of core\u2013shell nanostructures.",

Precise intercalation sites and controllable diffusion paths are very important for the structures and transport properties of TiO2 nanotubes. Based on first-principles calculations, herein, we discuss these parameters. The results indicate that TiO2 nanotubes with 2-coordinate oxygen vacancies could effectively improve the immigration ability of Li ions. The effective diffusion barriers (0.53 eV) between the outer and inner surfaces suggest a potential material for application in Li-ion barriers. ",

Despite growing activity in the field, very few photocatalysts exist that can efficiently and stably hydrogenate gaseous CO 2  to methanol at ambient pressure with high selectivity. Here, we report that a defect-laden indium oxide, In 2 O 3\u2212x (OH) y , with a rod-like nanocrystal superstructure, can photocatalyze the hydrogenation of CO 2  to methanol with 50% selectivity under simulated solar irradiation. Notably, the solar methanol production of the In 2 O 3\u2212x (OH) y  nanocrystal superstructures can be stabilized at a rate of 0.06\u00a0mmol g cat  \u22121  h \u22121  at atmospheric pressure. This is 120 times higher than that of the best-known photocatalysts. This discovery bodes well for the development of a low-pressure solar methanol process using CO 2  and renewable H 2  feedstocks.",

However, their widespread applications are often hindered by the low efficiency, high cost, and lack of eco-friendliness of existing preparation methods. Here we present a green, robust, efficient, cost-effective and scalable route to monodisperse hollow nanostructures with sodium citrate as the templates. A general precipitation method is developed to prepare uniform and intact salt nanostructures that serve as the green templates for hollow SiO2 nanostructures with controlled size, shape, thickness and porosity. This salt-templated strategy is also extended to the growth of hollow polydopamine nanostructures. We further demonstrate the one-pot synthesis of silica\u2013silver composite nanostructures that exhibit superior performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol.",

        "abstract": "X-type ligands, e.g., the pair of oleylamine (OAm) and oleic acid (OA), have been widely used to prepare CsPbX3 nanocrystals (NCs). However, the proton exchange between coordinated OAm and OA may induce the detachment of ligands, resulting in poor performance after cleaning or long-time storage. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that primary amines (L-type ligands) can stabilize a PbBrx-rich surface and yield a trap-free material with fully delocalized valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) states, which can significantly improve the photophysical properties and stability of CsPbBr3 NCs. Along this prediction, a room temperature re-precipitation method using L-type ligands (OAm, n-octylamine, or undecylamine) as the sole capping ligand has been developed to synthesize high-quality CsPbBr3 NC with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and dramatically improved stability against purification and water treatment. The enhancement can be attributed to the strong binding of unprotonated amines to lead atoms and the effective surface passivation provided by the resulted PbBrx-rich surface, which are highly consistent with the theoretical predictions. This work not only offers an approach to synthesize high-quality perovskite NCs, but also provides in-depth understanding of the surface modification of CsPbX3 NCs for practical applications.",

Currently, the main route for NH3 synthesis is via the heterogeneous catalytic Haber-Bosch process (N2+3H2\u21922NH3), which proceeds under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure with a very large carbon footprint. Herein we report that a pristine nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphitic carbon membrane (NCM) can electrochemically convert N2 into NH3 in an aqueous acidic solution under ambient conditions. The Faradaic efficiency and rate of production of NH3 on the NCM electrode reach 5.2% and 0.08 g m-2 h-1, respectively. After functionalization of the NCM with Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) these performance metrics are dramatically enhanced to 22% and 0.36 g m-2 h-1, respectively. As this system offers the potential to be scaled to industrial proportions there is a high likelihood it might displace the century old Haber-Bosch process.",

        "abstract": "Ammonia, key precursor for fertilizer production, convenient hydrogen carrier and emerging clean fuel, plays a pivotal role in sustaining life on earth. Currently, the main route for NH3 synthesis is via the heterogeneous catalytic Haber-Bosch process (N2+3H2 - 2NH3), which proceeds under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure with a very large carbon footprint. Herein we report that a pristine nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphitic carbon membrane (NCM) can electrochemically convert N2 into NH3 in an aqueous acidic solution under ambient conditions. The Faradaic efficiency and rate of production of NH3 on the NCM electrode reach 5.2% and 0.08 g m-2 h-1, respectively. After functionalization of the NCM with Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) these performance metrics are dramatically enhanced to 22% and 0.36 g m-2 h-1, respectively. These efficiencies and rates for the production of NH3 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure are unprecedented. As this system offers the potential to be scaled to industrial proportions there is a high likelihood it might displace the century old Haber-Bosch process.",

The numbers of euchromosome abnormalities were 79 (42.93%). The number of sex chromosome abnormalities and abnormal sex chromosome structure were 31 and 74, respectively, and they accounted for 16.85% and 40.22%, respectively. Among 184 cases with abnormal chromosome, 21 cases were azoospermia (11.41%) and 23 cases were oligospermia (12.50%). 96 cases were recurrent spontaneous abortion and multiple fetal death during pregnancy (52.17%). Delivery of terata was 23 (12.50%), mental retardation and abnormal development were 21 (11.41%).Conclusions:Chromosome abnormity is one of the important factors in patients with infertility. Chromosome examination should be performed to exclude the possibility of chromosome abnormity in patients with obstinate infertility.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the factors related to the ability of pregnancy, maternal and fetal outcomes,and problems in prenatal care after fertility-sparing therapy in non-benign ovarian tumor patients. Methods Patients, who were treated with fertility-sparing therapy for borderline or malignant ovarian tumors in People's Hospital, Peking University between January 2000 and April 2010, not elder than 40-year-old, and nulliparous, were followed up. Only the patients who succeeded in following-up, wished to be pregnant, and had no contraception for more than 1 year were divided into pregnant and non-pregnant group for the statistical study. Results 57 patients meet to the criteria. Among them, 42 patients were succeeded in contact, and 23 patients were studied finally. 12 patients were pregnant, and 11 patients were non-pregnant. The median time from the last surgery or chemotherapy to pregnancy was 10 months (range 3\uff5e60 months). The non-pregnant group had significant higher proportion in patients who were sterile before, or treated with staging surgery, or with more than stage I tumors than the pregnant group. The ratio of patients who were treated with oophorectomy in the non-pregnant group were higher than that of the pregnant group.The differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The common maternal and fetal complications were premature rupture of membrane, abortion, premature delivery and hyperbilirubinemia. 3 relapses in pregnant group were reported, of which, 2 happened during their late pregnancy. Conclusions The medical history of infertility, the type of conservative surgery, staging surgery or not, and stage may influence the pregnant ability of patients with borderline or malignant ovarian neoplasms after conservative treatment. Once pregnant, the prenatal care should be strengthened, in particular, the recurrence of tumors.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics, the antenatal management, the outcome and prognosis of chronic myeloproliferative disorders(CMPD) complicating pregnancy. METHODS: Retrospectively analyze the clinical data of eleven patients with CMPD complicating pregnancy hospitalized in Peking University People's Hospital from 2000 to 2009, including five patients with essential thrombocythemia, one with primary myelofibrosis and five with chronic myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: (1) Five pregnancies had periodic antenatal care and laboratory monitorings like full blood count. Reasonable anti-coagulation therapy was given to prevent the complications. One patient with PMF diagnosed before conception had her first pregnancy ended with mild pre-eclampsia and intrauterine death at the gestational age of 32 weeks. During the first trimester of her second pregnancy two years later, the test for anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein antibody was positive. She received low-dose aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin as anti-coagulants. An uneventful course was obtained and she delivered a healthy term infant. (2) Five pregnancies had occasional antenatal examination, including two patients with ET and three patients with CML. One patient with ET developed severe pre-eclampsia at the gestational age of 25 weeks. Umbilical artery Doppler showed reversed end-diastolic velocity. The management with anti-convulsants, anti-hypertensives and anti-coagulants showed no effect. An emergency cesarean section had to be performed because of the aggressive hypertension and placental abruption, with still birth as a result. Two pregnancies never had an antenatal care. Both of them were admitted on labor and the diagnoses of CML were made. (3) Four pregnancies developed oligohydramnios and three developed preelampsia (two severe pre-eclampsia and one mild pre-eclampsia). There was no other hemorrhage and thrombosis event. (4) Eight pregnancies reached full-term with four cesarean sections and four vaginal births. Two preterm cesarean sections were performed because of a progressive oligohydramnios. The ten live neonates weighed 1820 - 3600 g. All were appropriate for gestational age, except one fetal growth retardation (FGR) developed in one patient with severe pre-eclampsia. (5) As for the CMPD, the eleven patients were all in stable conditions. Three patients with CML received hydroxyurea in the third trimester, four with ET and one with CML had platelet-pheresis before delivery with favorable effect. All patients were uneventful postpartum, except one with CML who died in 5 months after childbirth. CONCLUSIONS: The pregnancy outcomes for patients with CMPD are mostly good. However, antenatal care should pay more attention to the complications such as thromboembolic accidents, pre-eclampsia, still birth and fetal growth retardation. Management including reasonable anti-coagulation therapy should be considered, which may help improve the prognosis.",

Methods Data of 12 patients with OSAHS diagnosed by nocturnal blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) monitoring and polysomnography (PSG) during pregnancy from May 2008 to Oct 2011 at Peking University People's Hospital were analyzed retrospectively.Results All the 12 patients were snorers, one with OSAHS family history, one with hypothyroidism, the other 10 with hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy (HDCP),8 cases with BMI\u226525 kg/m2 before pregnancy. Ten patients received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP ) treatment with good compliance under informed consent. The mean SaO2 (MSaO2) and the lowest SaO2 (LSaO2) during sleep after treatment had significantly increased than that of before treatment (96.29\u00b10.63) % vs (94.32\u00b11.14 )%( P<0.001), (89.5 \u00b15.28 )% vs( 80.85\u00b19.42 )% (P<0.05);while the number of oxygen desaturation \u22654% per hour (DI4) significantly decreased (0.96\u00b11.00 vs 11.16\u00b112.06, P<0.05).Two pregnency ended before 28 gestational weeks due to exacerbated HDCP. The case number of preterm labor, concurrent gestational diabetes and postpartum hemorrhage were 5, 6 and 2,respectively. The average weight of 10 live births were (3 231.7\u00b1702.5)g (1 500\uff5e4 070)g, nine patients had taken CPAP therapy after thediagnosis of OSAHS, there were no fetal growth retardation nor neonatal asphyxia, 5 premature newborns and one term newborn with hypoglycemia were transferred to NICU. Conclusions Pregnant women who have OSAHS risk factors should be paid attention to during the perinatal care and nocturnal SaO2 monitoring or PSG should be performed in the suspected OSAHS patients. The incidence of HDCP, gestational diabetes mellitus and preterm labor were relatively high in OSAHS patients. CPAP was a safe and effective treatment to OSAHS patients in pregnancy.",

Lab examinations were also performed. In the case of natural delivery, the rate of postpartum hemorrhage, and maternal mortality were 42%, and 50%, and the perinatal mortality and asphyxia in newborns were 50% and 58% respectively. In the case of cesarean section, the rate was 42%, 8%, and 13%, 38% respectively. The comprehensive therapies of termination of pregnancy by cesarean section plus medical supportive treatment can reduce the rate of postpartum hemorrhage, maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, and asphyxia in newborns significantly. Compared with the natural delivery, cesarean section had the higher rate of postpartum hemorrhage and the rate of asphyxia in newborns (P > 0.05), higher rate of maternal mortality and perinatal mortality (P < 0.05). All the death cases occurred in patients who only began to receive treatment 7 days after presentation of the symptoms. Compared with B ultrasonography, of which diagnosis rate of AFLP was 57%, CT had a higher diagnosis rate of 73% (P < 0.05).Early diagnosis, termination of pregnancy by cesarean section as soon as possible and a comprehensive therapy are the key to improve the mother and newborn's prognosis.",

Methods Thirty-one women underwent the surgery for combined defect of pelvic floor who were admitted to our department from December 2006 to April 2008. The patients were divided into two groups:14 cases in Gynecare Prolift System surgery and the other 17 in the group of revised total pelvic floor construction with Gynemesh. We compared the pre-,peri-operative data and follow-up results of the two groups were compared,respectively. Results No significant difference was found in the body mass index,menopause age and pregnant times between the two groups (P>0.05). The prolapse of anterior vaginal wall of the Prolift group was severe than Gynemesh group (P<0.05). The operative hemorrhage,the highest body temperature,the residue urine and the time of in-hospital of the two group had no significant difference (P>0.05).The operation time of Prolift group was shorter (P<0.05) than that of Gynemesh group. The follow-up rate of the Prolift group was 100%,with mean time of (8.8\u00b13.0) m. Only one case (7.1%) recurred with anterior vaginal prolapse in 6 months after operation. One case (7.1%) occurred erosion in posterior vaginal wall. The follow-up rate of the Gyenmesh group was 94%,with mean time of (12.4\u00b13.0) m. Four cases (23.5%) were recurrence and 3 (17.6%) were found erosion in vaginal wall. Conclusion The Prolift system and Gynemesh are both safety and feasible. According to the short term clinical outcomes,the Prolift system is little bit better than the Gyenmesh,yet the long term outcomes need further study.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical value of pubococcygeal line (PCL) determined by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used in evaluating pelvic organ prolapse (POP), and investigate the relationship of pelvic organ prolapse quantitation (POP-Q) stage and pubococcygeal line (PCL) for the patient with POP. METHODS: Twenty patients with POP were evaluated by POP-Q stage and pelvic dynamic MRI examination simultaneously. Sagittal MRI images were acquired at rest and during maximal Valsalva using a fast gradient echo sequence two-dimensional fast low angle shot (FLASH) T(1) weighted image. The degree of prolapsed anterior vaginal wall, uterus and posterior vaginal wall were measured by PCL and compared with POP-Q system. RESULTS: There were 20 cases with cystocel diagnosed by POP-Q staging system, in which bladder neck or bladder base of 17 patients were under the PCL during maximum Valsalva. The concordance rate was 85% (17/20) between PCL and POP-Q stage. There were 19 cases with rectocele diagnosed by POP-Q, in which the anorectal junction of 4 patients' PCL descent below more than 2.5 cm. The concordance rate was 4/19 between PCL and POP-Q stage. There were 14 cases with uterine prolapse diagnosed by POP-Q staging system, in which uterine cervix of all descent below PCL. The concordance rate was 14/14 between PCL and POP-Q stage. However, it was noted that 5 cases did not reach POP-Q staging and their lowest uteri cervix were below or above PCL but less than 1 cm at maximal Valsalva. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with POP-Q staging system, the reference line of PCL determined by dynamic MRI could diagnose uterine prolapse accurately and anterior vaginal wall with greater clinical value, however it was limited in diagnosing posterior vaginal wall prolapse effectively. Therefore, the clinical value of PCL should be further studied for evaluating POP.",

Seven patients (15%, 7/48) presented with obvious renal impairment [serum creatinine (sCr) \u2265 125 \u00b5mol/L] prepregnancy, and nine (19%, 9/48) were recorded with chronic hypertension. Thirty-three patients received regular prenatal care. Twenty-one cases (44%, 21/48) developed preeclampsia. During the gestation, normal renal function (defined as sCr < 71 \u00b5mol/L) was seen in nineteen cases (40%, 19/48), mild dysfunction (sCr ranged 71 - 132 \u00b5mol/L) in twenty (42%, 20/48) and moderate to severe dysfunction (sCr \u2265 132 \u00b5mol/L) in nine cases (19%, 9/48). Twenty patients had negative or mild proteinuria (24 hour urine protein < 2000 mg), 19 had moderate (24 hour urine protein ranged 2000 - 5000 mg) and nine had severe proteinuria (24 hour urine protein \u2265 5000 mg). The gestational age at delivery ranged from 24 to 41 weeks and the neonatal birth weight ranged from 890 to 4150 g. A total of twenty patients (42%, 20/48) suffered adverse perinatal outcome, including one case with late spontaneous abortion, fifteen with preterm delivery, eleven with small for gestational age, two with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and four with perinatal death. Declined maternal renal function was seen in eight patients, and two patients progressed toward the end-stage renal failure (the stage of uremia). Multivariate regression analysis identified that preeclampsia (OR = 24.72, P = 0.002) and the degree of proteinuria (OR = 4.24, P = 0.032) were the independent risk factors for the adverse perinatal outcome.Pregnancies complicated with chronic renal diseases have significantly high incidence of preeclampsia and adverse perinatal outcome. Preeclampsia and the degree of proteinuria are perhaps the independent risk factors for the adverse outcome.",

The questionnaire of climacteric symptoms and sexual activity were designed and delivered to all patients. Serum levels of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured and transposed ovaries were observed with B ultrasound post operation.The climacteric symptoms of patients who received transposed ovary unilaterally or bilaterally were not difference significantly at the mean follow-up times of 14.2 and 17.4 months, respectively (P > 0.05). However, of the patients who underwent adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy post-surgery, climacteric symptoms were significantly more common (85%) than without adjuvant therapy (13%) (P < 0.05). Serum estradiol, and FSH levels and climacteric symptoms of the patients, who received adjuvant radiotherapy, had no significant difference between the ovaries transposed 2 cm above and 2 cm below anterosuperior horizontal iliac spine.Transposed ovary to peritoneal cavity could preserve the function of ovary.

Nine premenopausal and 8 postmenopausal women with squamous carcinoma of cervix who underwent surgery served as controls. The expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in squamous epithelium (SE), lamina propria (LP) and muscular layer (ML) of anterior vaginal wall were studied by immunohistochemical staining.(1) Both ERalpha and ERbeta were expressed in SE, LP, ML of vaginal wall of premenopausal and postmenopausal women. (2) The expression of ERalpha was not significantly different in premenopausal and postmenopausal women; the expression of ERbeta was not significantly different in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with POP; however, it was decreased in postmenopausal women without POP (P < 0.05). (3) The expression of ERbeta was significantly higher in postmenopausal POP group than in postmenopausal control group (P < 0.05). The expression of ERalpha was not significantly different in postmenopausal control and postmenopausal POP group.ERalpha and ERbeta are expressed in vaginal wall of premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In vaginal wall of postmenopausal women with POP, the expression of ERbeta is not decreased; on the contrary, it is increased compared with that of postmenopausal control.

Multiple logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors associated with PE.(1) Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed before conception while 13 were diagnosed during gestation. Eleven patients including all the 7 who were categorized as severe CAA presented with mild bleeding in the third trimester. (2) The medians of white blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentrations and platelet counts were 5.0\u00d710\u2079/L, 66.0 g/L and 12.0\u00d710\u2079/L respectively. (3) The obstetric management consisted of strict assessment, intensive surveillance and follow-up, appropriate supportive measures, timely recognition of complications, and delivery when necessary. Twenty-one patients received supportive transfusions. Ten patients developed PE, all of whom were diagnosed as severe PE (SPE). Twelve patients suffered postpartum hemorrhage, and 3 of them had blood loss more than 1000 ml. All were conservatively treated in success. (4) The median gestational age of delivery was 37 weeks. Sixteen cases delivered before 37 weeks and 5 delivered before 34 weeks. Two patients developed SPE at 29 weeks and 30 weeks respectively, and both of the neonates died for severe asphyxia. The birth weight of the live neonates ranged from 1500 to 3660 g. (5) The postpartum follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 7 years. Thirty-three patients got improvement without dependence on transfusions. Four achieved no remission and still needed intermittent transfusions. Four were lost in follow-up. (6) Significant differences were found in the bleeding tendency, the platelet counts and the delivery weeks when comparing the patients developing PE and those without PE. No differences were found with regard to the age, the gestational age of first visit, the percentage of patients diagnosed before conception, the percentage of severe CAA, the choice of treatment, the white blood cell counts and the hemoglobin level. The Multiple logistic regression showed that the platelet count less than 10\u00d710\u2079/L was an independent risk factor for CAA patients developing PE (P = 0.006).Most pregnancies complicated with CAA could achieve good maternal and fetal outcome, when intensive prenatal care and supportive management are provided. SPE is the most common complication. The platelet count less than 10\u00d710\u2079/L is perhaps an independent risk factor for CAA patients developing PE.",

Methods Data of 12 patients diagnosed with uterine rupture from January 2006 to December 2011 in Peking University People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Results The number of delivery in this period was 12 697, so the incidence of uterine rupture was 0.09% (12/12 697). Clinical analysis found that 10 patients with uterine rupture were multipara with uterine scar after the previous cesarean section, another patient was primipara with uterine scar after the previous myomectomy and primipara without special medical record. The clinical manifestations of uterine rupture varied in some degree, only 3 patients showed persistent abdominal pain or abdominal distension, 3 patients complained of irregular abdominal pain and the other patients had no obvious symptoms. Among the 12 patients, 10 incomplete uterine rupture were diagnosed during operation and 2 cases with complete rupture of uterus were diagnosed preoperatively. One patient had the history of infertility.Conclusion Uterine scar has become the most common cause of uterine rupture, efforts should be made to control the rate of cesarean section in primiparas and constantly improve the ability of diagnosis and treatment of uterine rupture in high-risk patients.",

The average gestation week was 7 weeks (5 - 13 weeks) when they came to our hospital. Seven pregnancies gave birth, among which CML was diagnosed during pregnancy in four patients and pregnancy was confirmed during CML in three patients. The average gestation week was 36 weeks (27 - 40 weeks(+2)) when they came to our hospital. Among the seven women three were treated with hydroxyurea (one became pregnant while she was on hydroxyurea and she elected to continue her pregnancy and continued to use hydroxyurea), one with leukapheresis twice after her 40 weeks of gestation, one with plateletpheresis and three hadn't any treatment. In the seven pregnacies three developed severe pre-eclampsias, including the two had hydroxyurea during the gestation. The average delivery gestational week was 38 weeks (33 weeks(+4) - 41 weeks), two were premature birth. Two caesarean sections, three vaginal deliveries and two forceps deliveries. There were two postpartum hemorrhage, during the 24 hours the amount of bleeding was 1500 - 1800 ml and secondary disseminated intravascular coagulation happened. Seven patients gave birth to seven infants whose average birth weight was 2469 g (1820 - 2810 g), of whom two were premature infants, two low birth weight infants, one had congenital malformation and two had abnormal blood routine examinations. (2) Management after delivery and prognosis: during the nine patients who ended pregnancy with therapeutic abortion during the first or second trimester four withdraw, one died whose course of disease was 3 years and the other four were alive during 5 months to 72 months, among which one had stem cell transplantation, two are taking imatinib mesylate and one takes hydroxyurea. Among the seven patients who deliveried two withdraw, two died and three are alive. Among the seven infants two withdraw, the other five have normal development following 4 months to 9 years.CML patient may have successful pregnancy and delivery, and it is not the absolute indication for terminating pregnancy. On the other hand, CML and the treatment during pregnancy can have side effect on the mother and the fetus, so the patients should be monitored and treated in tertiary hospitals.",

Obstetric diagnostic criteria was: PPCM was one of dilated cardiomyopathy, occurred during the third trimester of pregnancy through the 6th month postpartum, and without cardiovascular diseases before. Internal medicine diagnostic criteria was: PPCM was unexplained cardiomegaly and heart failure, occurred during the last month of pregnancy through the 5th month postpartum, and meet the echocardiographic criteria of dialated cardiomyopathy as follows:left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd) greater than 5.0 cm; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 45%, and(or) left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) less than 30%; or LVEDd greater than 2.7 cm/body surface area (m2); or LVEDd>117% of age and body surface area predictive value. Hibbard diagnostic criteria was: All four of the following: (1) heart failure within last month of pregnancy and 5 months postpartum; (2) absence of prior heart disease; (3) no determinable cause; (4) strict echocardiographic indication of left ventricular dysfunction: LVEF less than 45%, and/or LVFS less than 30%, and LVEDd greater than 2.7 cm/m2. The compliance between obstetric and internal criteria with Hibbard criteria, and the reasons of incompliance between Chinese and international criteria were analyzed.Eight patients were diagnosed of PPCM by obstetricians according to Chinese obstetric criteria. Among them, 6 patients (6/8) did not meet Hibbard criteria.2 of the six did not reach the time regulated in the criteria. All of the six had other determinable causes for heart failure, and their echocardiographic results did not meet the diagnostic standard either. The other 41 patients were diagnosed of PPCM by physicians according to Chinese internal medicine criteria. Among them, 7 patients (17%) did not meet Hibbard criteria, 3 of the seven did not reach the time regulated in the criteria, and had other determinable causes for heart failure either.4 of the seven did not meet the echocardiographic standard part in the criteria. The Chinese internal medicine diagnostic criteria has a significant higher coincidence rate with Hibbard criteria, compared to Chinese obstetric criteria (83% vs. 25%; P<0.01). Among all 13 patients whose PPCM diagnosis did not meet Hibbard criteria, 5 cases did not reach the time regulated in the criteria, 9 cases had other determinable causes for heart failure, and 10 cases did not meet the echocardiographic standard part in the criteria. Preeclampsia was the most common determinable causes for heart failure, accounted for 7 cases.There is obvious difference between Chinese and Hibbard diagnostic criteria for PPCM, especially Chinese obstetric criteria.",

Acellular dermal mesh was used for pelvic floor reconstruction in the operation. The average age was 66 (43-77) years. The number of patients with the uterine prolapse was 19, and the other one patient was vaginal vault prolapse. Twenty cases had the anterior vaginal wall prolapse, and 17 cases were with the posterior vaginal wall prolapse. Fifteen cases received anterior vaginal wall reparation with acellular dermal mesh, and 2 cases received the posterior vaginal wall reparation with acellular dermal mesh. Both of the anterior and posterior vaginal walls were repaired with acellular dermal mesh in 3 cases.The mean operation time was 113.1 minutes (70-180 minutes). The mean time of mesh placement was about 10 min only. The mean hemorrhage was 175 ml (50-300 ml). All the patients recovered well after operation. The mean period of follow-up after operation was 9. 3 months (6-12 months). No erosion or infection was found. Four cases of recurrence (20% )were found. Three cases of them were of stage I recurrence with no symptoms. One case of them was of stage II recurrence with no symptoms. And the recurrences were found at a half year after operation.The application of acellular dermal mesh in female pelvic reconstruction surgery is easy and simple. Patient tolerance is good.

        "abstract": "To investigate the regulation of human progesterone receptor isoforms A and B in uterine endometrial carcinoma by estrogen and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) so as to provide theoretical basis for clinical hormone treatment of uterine endothelium cancer.The uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line HEC-IB and the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were cultured in vitro. The HEC-IB cells were stimulated by 10 nmol/L estrogen and 20 ng/ml IGF-I respectively for 72 h. The MCF-7 cells were stimulated by 10 nmol/L estrogen for 72 h. Western blotting was used to examine the protein levels of the two isoforms of receptors of progesterone. RNA was extracted from the cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA levels of the isoform B.(1) Western blotting showed that the photodensity values of hPRA and hPRB did not change significantly after the HEC-IB cells were stimulated by estrogen for 72 hours (P = 0.716, and 0.391 respectively), however, the hPRA and hPRB were significantly down-regulated after IGF-I had been given for 72h (P = 0.008 and 0.002 respectively). After MCF-7 cell was given estrogen for 72 h hPR-A tended to be up- regulated but this change had no significant difference (P = 0.074) however, hPRB was significantly up- regulated (P = 0.044). (2) RT-PCR showed that hPRB mRNA was not expressed in HEC-IB cells originally, and became positive after stimulation by estrogen and IGF-1 for 72 hours respectively, however, the expression level being higher in the HEC-IB cells stimulated by estrogen than in those stimulated by IGF-1. hPRB was not expressed in MCF-7 cells originally too, and became positive after simulation by estrogen and IGF-1 for 72 hours respectively, however, the expression level being higher in the MCF-7 cells stimulated by estrogen than in those stimulated by IGF-1.(1) Estrogen and IGF-I regulate hPR isoforms and have cell specialty. (2) Estrogen and IGF-I up- regulate hPRB mRNA at gene level or transcription level, but there are some inhibitory factors which make the protein production become less after transcription.",

Ultrasound and clinical consult were offered and neonates were under follow-up.Results Among the 7873 cases, 19 cases (0.24 per cent) were diagnosed as true mosaics,73 cases (0.93 per cent) had pseudomosaicism involving less than two cells from the same culture with an identical abnormality. In 19 cases with true mosaics, 11 cases were obtained umbilical cord blood transabdominally again and the results of 8 cases were in accordance with that of amniocentesis samples (in those cases, 6 cases terminating pregnancy, one case continuing pregnancy and one case losing), but the results of 3 cases were normality without mosaicism (the cases continuing pregnancy). Other 7 cases refused to underwent umbilical cord blood (2 cases continuing pregnancy and 5 cases terminating pregnancy). 73 cases of pseudomosaicism were seen in amniotic fluid specimens, and all these cases resulted in the live birth of normal healthy infants except for one fetus with ventricular septal defect and 11 cases lossing.Conclusions There was high pseudomosaicism in amniocentesis cultures. So, if necessary a third culture (including an in situ culture) is extensively analyzed for misdiagnosing as true mosaicism from pseudomosaicism. Detailed long term follow-up of prenatal diagnosed mosaics is also essential for assessing the clinical significance of the laboratory findings.",

The paper investigates the effect of dielectric property of nano-montmorillonite transnature polyethylene (PE), the polyethylene/montmorillonite (PE/MMT) nano-composites are prepared by melting intercalation process. The dielectric properties of the nano-composites are investigated, and then the space charge profile in PE/MMT and PE is measured by pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) method respectively.

        "abstract": "The dielectric properties of nanometric dielectrics have attracted much attention since John Lewis published the article, the title is \"Nanometric Dielectrics\", on IEEE transactions on dielectric and electrical insulation in 1994. However, the majority of works reported in the literature were involved in comparing the dielectric properties of polymer/inorganic nano-particles composites those of with polymer/inorganic micro-particles composites, and investigation on dielectric properties of polymer layered silicate (PLS) nano-composites, which exhibit excellent thermal and mechanical properties, were rarely found to be reported. In the present paper, the polyethylene/montmorillonite nano-composites are prepared by melting intercalation process. The characteristics of electrical breakdown and partial discharge (PD) of the nano-composites are investigated. The Weibull statistical analysis of electrical breakdown strength is performed. The test results indicate that electrical breakdown strength of LDPE/O-MMT is obviously higher than that of LDPE, up to 1.35-1.70 times at the test temperature of 60-90\u00b0C, especially. The PD tests display that both the amplitude and number of PD are smaller than pure PE under the same test condition. It an be confirmed that polyethylene improved by nano-montmorillonite is provided with much higher dielectric strength and better partial discharge resistance property than those of pure PE.",

It is observed that treeing defects appear in electrical aging samples, delamination is characteristic of thermal aging samples and crack in aging sample results from mechanical stress. The amplitude spectrum of acoustic signals obtained from various samples indicates that the defects in larger size lead to higher frequency components, such as the frequency components about 6kHz are observed in thermal aging samples with delamination while the frequency components about 2kHz are characteristics of the specimens subjected to electrical stress and mechanical stress. However joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA) of partial discharge (PD) pulse waveform exhibit that higher frequency components in dispersion appear in JTFA spectrum of electrical aging samples.",

Methylenadic anhydride plays a curing role in this system. The intergallery distance of montmorillonite was measured by X-ray diffraction before and after exfoliation. The interphase morphological characteristic of the fracture surface on specimen was characterized by scanning electric microscopy. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to estimate the thermal performance of the composites. Some conclusions are drawn by analyzing the results that exfoliated composites can be prepared via either a solvent intercalation process or a melt intercalation process. It is found that the clay layers cannot be separated further in the duration of mechanic stirring because of the generated agglomeration. The thermal decomposition temperature does not increase with the increased concentration of nanoclay but present a complicated tendency.",

The test results indicated that both rising time of PD pulse and pulse width vary with aging time.

In the two-dimensional plane, the smaller of the box-counting dimension of electrical trees is, its space of spreading is greater and rate of spreading is faster. The stable local fractal dimension of different shapes of electrical trees is in a certain range, so electrical trees can be classified base on the fractal theory.

        "abstract": "Space charge existed in polymer subjected DC high electrical stress has attracted more and more attention over the world. Various methods of inhibiting space charge generation and accumulation had been attempted in order to reduce insulation deterioration. In the present paper, the polyethylene/montmorillonite nanocomposites are prepared by melting intercalation process. The distribution of space charges in the nano-composite is investigated by means of pulse electric acoustic (PEA) method under different conditions. The effects of maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (PEMA) on space charge characteristics of the composites are discussed. The test results indicate that the heterogeneous space charges in the nanocomposite near the cathode gradually decrease with PEMA content increasing. When PEMA content is 20%, the heterogeneous space charges near the cathode almost disappear at all in the nanocomposite. In short-circuiting process, the residual space charges in the nanocomposite with compatilizer obviously decrease comparing with origin LDPE. It is suggested that PEMA as a compatilizer can improve the interaction combination between LDPE and O-MMT, consequently interfacial traps reduce. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

The results of impact and heat distortion temperature test showed that mixing temperature effected the impact and thermal properties and showed a maximum at 90\u00b0C. Compared with pristine epoxy, the impact strength and distortion temperature of the nanocomposites as prepared by mixing at 90\u00b0C before curing was simultaneously improved, 31.6% and 14\u00b0C, respectively Morphology of fracture face of the epoxy nanocomposites was investigated by means of SEM imagines.

Scanning electric microscopy(SEM)and atomic force microscopy(AFM)are used to characterized the microstructure of nanocomposite obtained. Mechanical properties,thermal properties and dielectric properties of the nanocomposite are studied using impact tester,Martin heat resistance tester,dielectric loss analyzer. The results proved that,there are two kinds of shapes of oMMT dispersed in epoxy, either sphericity or cingulum,the average dimension is 20nm. The oMMT dispersed uniformly in nanocomposite with mixing temperature is 90\u2103,compared to the unmodified epoxy,the martin heat resistance temperature and impact strength of the composite improved 10\u2103 and 31.6%,respectively. The maximum of impact strength of nanocomposite is obtained when the oMMT loading is 2phr(per hundred resin). SEM and AFM photograph are showed that the thermal stability and toughness of the composite are all related to the dispersion of montmorillonite,and the impact strength of composite is related to the adhesive joining of the interface between epoxy and montmorillonite. The relationshipbetween microstructure and properties of the composite is studied,then toughen mechanism of montmorillonite toughen epoxy is speculated as massive shear yielding. The value of the \u03b5r is lower than that of pristine epoxy materials,the increase of the tan\u03b4 with the temperature is delayed. The possible reason is that the mobility of polymer chains is restricted between the layers of MMT.",

Moreover, we focused on the characteristics of electrical breakdown and electrical conductivity of the nano-composites. The test results indicate that electrical breakdown strength and insulation resistance of LDPE/O-MMT is obviously higher than that of LDPE, after 66 hours electrical aging, electrical breakdown strength of LDPE/O-MMT/C is 1.10 times that of LDPE. \"interaction zones\" may form in LDPE and MMT such as crosslinking points and it can reduce the electric field damage of nanocomposites. It can be confirmed that polyethylene improved by nano-montmorillonite is provided with much higher dielectric strength and better heat resistance property than those of pure PE.",

The loss factor of the bars fully shielded was smaller than those with partial shield layer. The dielectric loss factors of the fully shield bars were similarly but the partial discharge magnitude and breakdown voltage are very different depending on different structure of internal corona protection.

The results show that the dielectric loss factor(tan\u03b4) of generator stator bar is related with the insulation structure, anti-corona structure, conductor size and main insulation thickness of the stator bar. The dielectric loss factor of the bar with anti-corona coating at the end is bigger than that of the bar without anti-corona coating. With the increase of anti-corona coating thickness, main insulation thickness and conductor size, the dielectric loss factor decreases.",

In order to understand the service conditions of insulating materials, it is very important to investigate on partial discharge characteristic in electrical apparatus. In the present paper, a set of acquisition system for acoustic signal generated by partial discharge is established in laboratory. The acoustic emission signals are generated by pinplane electrodes in oil insulation system in the voltage range of 4-6kV, the distance between electrodes and sensors in the range of 10-15cm. The test results show that voltage applied and distance between sensor and pin-plane regularly influence energy distribution of acoustic signal in different frequency component. The discrete wavelet transform is used to analyze acoustic signal acquired. A feature extraction method to classify partial discharge and a new method to identify different types of acoustic signal based on combined wavelet network and wavelet transform are respectively suggested.",

The mass fractions of the inorganic fillers were 1, 3, and 5 wt%, respectively. The direct current (DC) voltage characteristics of the composites showed that the electrical conductivities and nonlinear coefficients of the composites utilizing single-filler types increased with increasing inorganic filler content. Under the same conditions, the conductivity and nonlinear coefficient of SiC/EP were both larger than those of the nano-ZnO/EP and micro-ZnO/EP. However, the nonlinear coefficient of the composites was significantly affected by the simultaneous addition of the two inorganic fillers, micro-ZnO and nano-SiC. When the content ratio of micro-ZnO to nano-SiC was 2:3, the nonlinear coefficient of the composite reached a maximum value of 3.506, significantly higher than those of the other samples. Compared with the nano-SiC/EP, micro-ZnO/EP and nano-ZnO/EP composites with 5 wt% inorganic filler, the nonlinear coefficient of the two-filler composite was greater by a factor of 0.82, 2.48, and 5.01, respectively.",

Chemical composition of different organic-montmorillonite was analyzed by Fourier Transition Infrared(FTIR). The temperature properties of resistivity of composites were measured by Megger. The temperature dependence of composites dielectric spectrum was verified by using a Schering bridge. The results show that whether octadecyl ammonium chloride or the coupling agent KH550, they can interact with the montmorillonite both. The test results of the composite indicated that, inclusion of K-MMT and O-MMT into epoxy matrix can reduce permittivity and dissipation factor. The permittivity and dissipation factor of K-MMT/EP composites respectively reduced 5% and 35%, and those of O-MMT/EP composites respectively reduced 16% and 41%, when testing temperature is 160\u00b0C. It can be confirmed that epoxy improved by organic-montmorillonite is provided with better heat resistance property than those of pure epoxy. As for O-MMT/EP composites, the permittivity and dissipation factor of composites that contains 5wt% O-MMT is lowest. For instance, the permittivity reduced 18% and the dissipation factor reduced 42% than pure epoxy, when it is room temperature and power frequency.",

        "abstract": "Polypropylene (PP) contains promising application prospects in thermoplastic cables for high voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission because of its outstanding thermal and dielectric properties. However, the problem of poor toughness and space charge has restricted the application of pure PP in HVDC cables. In this paper, polyolefin elastomer (POE) and nano-silica were blended thoroughly and added into a PP mixture by a melting method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to observe the dispersion of POE and nanoparticles. Thermal properties were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Mechanical properties were evaluated by tensile tests. The elastomeric properties of composites were improved as the dispersed POE could transfer and homogenize external mechanical forces. DC breakdown results showed that the fail strength of composite with 10 phr POE and 1 phr nano-silica was obviously enhanced. The pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) results showed that the injection and accumulation of space charge was increased by the introduction of POE, while it was restrained by the collective effect caused by nano-silica filling. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrograms showed that secondary ordered structures existed in the composites of PP, POE, and nano-silica, and that the ordered structure around the nanoparticles contributed to the enhancement of breakdown strength. The mechanical and dielectric properties were modified synergistically, which made the modified PP a propitious insulation material for HVDC cables.",

        "abstract": "The melt blending was used to prepare 3 wt% ZnO/low density polyethylene (ZnO/LDPE) nanocomposites in this article. The effect of different inorganic ZnO particles doping on the dielectrical property and crystal habit of LDPE matrix was explored. The nanoparticles size was 9 nm, 30 nm, 100 nm, and 200 nm respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to characterize ZnO nanoparticles whereas differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to make thermal characterization of the samples. Besides, the AC (alternating current), DC (direct current breakdown characteristics and electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites was studied in this article. The experimental results showed that nano-ZnO/LDPE composites had the advantages such as small crystal size, high crystallization rate and crystallinity owing to nano-ZnO particles doping, when doping nano-ZnO particles size was 30 nm, the ZnO/LDPE nanocomposite crystallinity crest value 39.77% appeared. At the mean time, the DC and AC breakdown field strength values of composites were 138.0 kV/mm and 340.4 kV/mm respectively. They were the maximal values which improved 8.24% and 13.85% than LDPE. The AC breakdown field strength of samples decreased with specimen thickness increase. The DC breakdown field strength of LDPE and ZnO/LDPE composites were greater than AC breakdown field strength. From the conductivity experimental result it could be seen that when the experimental temperature and electric field intensity rose, the current density and conductivity of ZnO/LDPE composites increased with the enlargement of ZnO particles size. But the values were less than which of LDPE.",

The crystalline morphology and breakdown properties of the composites were investigated. The experimental results show that the crystal grain size of the composites with inorganic fillers obviously reduces and the distribution is more uniform comparing with LDPE. The average crystal grain size of N-SiO 2  is 23.1\u03bcm which is the smallest among all samples and that of origin LDPE is the biggest about 46.5\u03bcm in size. The DC breakdown field strength of the composites with SiO 2  in different size and contain was significantly higher than that of LDPE, the breakdown strength of N-SiO 2  composites is the highest, which is 338.8 kV/mm and 20.1% higher than LDPE. The results of comparative experiments show that the preparation process of the micro- and nano-composites has obvious influence on their properties.",

Finally, the crystalline structure and propagation path of electrical trees were observed by polarized light microscopy (PLM). The observation results show that there is a crystalline dense region in the center of LDPE spherocrystal structure, and the crystallization around this region shows obvious radial morphology. Under the electrical field, most branches of the electrical tree grow along the boundary between spherocrystal and spherocrystal or spherocrystal and amorphous region due to their structure differences in LDPE. Electrical tree will insert the inside of the spherocrystal and then grow to the spherocrystal center along the interphase between lamellar crystals when local electrical field is higher or electrical field is subjected for long-term. And the color of electrical tree path is darker. When the electric tree branches inside the small spherocrystal grow to a certain extent, they will cross the spherocrystal grow again along the spherocrystal boundary. Most branches of the electrical tree present a form that they are bypasses the spherocrystal and grow along the boundary between spherocrystals, so the propagation shapes of electrical treeing associate with the spherocrystal morphology and exhibit the fractal characteristic of multi inflection point.",

More reactive groups and better interfacial compatibility with UP make vinyl resin M7270 a more suitable polymer for preparing sizing agent for CF/UP composites when compared to epoxy, MR13006 and R806. The surface characteristics of CFs and the interfacial properties of the composites before and after surface modification were investigated. The observed uniformly dispersed CNTs-containing sizing agent on the CF surface obviously increased the surface roughness. The amount of polar functional groups and the wettability of CFs were significantly enhanced after the coating treatment. The interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and impact toughness were enhanced by 32.3 and 55.2%, respectively. The sizing agent effectively enhanced the interfacial adhesion by improving the surface energy, and increasing chemical bonding and mechanical interlocking.",

In order to study the effect of humidity on the dielectric properties of nano-dielectric, polypropylene (PP) was modified by polyolefin elastomer (POE) and nano-SiO, and the samples with obvious filling concentration were pre-selected by breakdown strength for damp aging. The aging experiments were carried out in different relative humidity. The dielectric properties of new, hygroscopic saturation and samples after drying were measured and analyzed. It is found that the breakdown strength of hygroscopic saturation nano-dielectrics decreased obviously compared with new samples, and it was difficult to recover after drying. The damp degradation resulted in different changing trends of permittivity of PP and nano-dielectric, but there were relaxation loss peaks of water in both of them. The influence of damp degradation on the trap distribution was studied by thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC), and it was found that the traps level introduced by water molecules was different in PP and nano-dielectrics. All experiment results showed that the performance of nano-dielectrics degraded obviously in humid environment, and it was difficult to recover even after complete drying because of the existence of bounded water molecules in nano-dielectrics.",

In this article, nano-MMT/LDPE and nano-ZnO/LDPE composites were prepared by polymer intercalation and melt blending, respectively. The octadecyl quaternary ammonium salt and silane coupling agent were applied for surface modification in nano-MMT and nano-ZnO particles, and this then improved the compatibility of nanoparticles and polymeric matrix. These samples were characterized by FTIR, PLM, DSC and TSC, from which the effect of nanoparticles doping on polymer crystal habit and interface traps would be explored. In these experiments, the AC breakdown characteristics and space charge characteristic of different composites were studied. The experimental results showed that the interface bonding of nanoparticles and polymer was improved by coupling agents modifying. The dispersion of nanoparticles in matrix was better. When the mass fraction of nanoparticles doping was 3 wt.%, the crystallization rate and crystallinity of composites increased, and the crystalline structure was more complete. Besides, the amorphous regions in material decreased and the conducting channel was circuitous. At this time, the breakdown field strength of nano-MMT/LDPE and nano-ZnO/LDPE increased by 10.3% and 11.1%, compared to that of pure LDPE, respectively. Furthermore, the density and depth of interface traps in polymer increased with nanoparticles doping. Nano-MMT and nano-ZnO could both restrain the space charge accumulation, and the inhibiting effect of nano-ZnO was more visible.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of the maternal rats supplemented with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy on lipid metabolism and uncoupling protein 2 gene expression of offspring. Method Female SD rats were randomly divided into A,B,C groups by weight. Group A was fed with basic diet. Group B and C were supplemented with low and high dose of DHA during pregnancy respectively. All male offspring were suckled by rats in group A,and fed with basic diet from weaning (3 w) to 8 w. Then the offspring from group A were randomly divided into A1 and A2 subgroup. A1 was fed with basic diet continuously,while rats from A2,B,C groups were assigned to high-fat diet for 7 w to induce obesity. Eight rats from each group were selected randomly and sacrificed at 8,15 w. Body weight,body fat,blood lipid and uncoupling protain 2 (UCP2) mRNA level were measured. Results There was no difference in the birth weight and body weight of offspring in A,B,C groups (P>0.05) at 8 w. At 8 w body fat and TG in groups B and C were significantly lower than group A (P<0.05). At 15 w,the body weight,body fat and TG in group A2 were significantly higher than group A1(P<0.05),while TG in groups B and C were significantly lower than group A2 (P<0.05). At 8 w,the abundance of UCP2 mRNA in groups B and C were higher than group A. At 15 w,the UCP2 mRNA level in C group was higher than B,A1 and A2 successively,A2 was the lowest. Conclusion Supplementation with DHA during pregnancy could decrease the body weight and serum TG level in offspring,and may prevent offspring from high fat-induced obesity and improve lipidmetabolism in adulthood. Up-regulation of the expression of UCP2 mRNA may be the underlying mechanism.",

        "abstract": "\ufffd\ufffd-eleostearic acid (\ufffd\ufffd-ESA) has been shown to possess antitumor activity in cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the antitumor effect of \ufffd\ufffd-ESA in breast cancer cells showing different expression levels of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). \ufffd\ufffd-ESA inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in the SKBR3 and T47D breast cancer cell lines. The mechanism by which cell growth was inhibited involved G0/G1 and G2/M cell cycle phase arrest. The MTT assay showed that SKBR3 cells are more sensitive to \ufffd\ufffd-ESA compared to T47D cells. Western blot analysis revealed that \ufffd\ufffd-ESA treatment not only reduced HER2/HER3 protein expression, but also increased the level of phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN), which led to decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt. Inactive Akt further reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\ufffd\ufffd (GSK-3\ufffd\ufffd) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated death promoter (BAD) proteins. Furthermore, the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was found to be reduced following \ufffd\ufffd-ESA treatment. Notably, nuclear factor \ufffd\ufffdB (NF-\ufffd\ufffdB) was activated by \ufffd\ufffd-ESA treatment. Data of the present study showed that the antitumor activity of \ufffd\ufffd-ESA is at least partly mediated by reduction of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer protein level, activation of the Akt/BAD/Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway and inhibition of the Akt/GSK-3\ufffd\ufffd survival pathway in the two breast cancer cell lines investigated in this study. Therefore, \ufffd\ufffd-ESA may be considered a beneficial dietary factor for the prevention and treatment of invasive breast cancer in cells overexpressing HER2.",

After 3 weeks, all rats were assigned to basic diet for two weeks, then rats from A group were randomly divided into A1 and A2 subgroups. A1 subgroup was fed on basic diet continuously. A2 subgroup and B, C and D groups were assigned to high-fat diet for six weeks. Eight rats from each group were sacrificed at the end of different treatments to detect body weight, body fat content and blood glucose level. RT-PCR was used to determine the gene expression of hormone-sensitive lipase in white adipose tissue.Body weight, body fat content and blood glucose level in C group were significantly lower than those in A2 subgroup on 11 weeks (P < 0.05). The body weight, body fat content in B2 group were significantly lower than those in A2 subgroup (P < 0.05), but blood glucose level was higher than A2 subgroup on 11 weeks (P > 0.05). The body weight in D group was significantly lower than that in A2 subgroup (P < 0.05), but body fat content and blood glucose level were not significantly lower than A2 subgroup on 11 weeks (P > 0.05). The expression of HSL in B2 and C group was higher on 9 weeks and 11 weeks respectively. The HSL mRNA levels in all groups on 3 weeks were similar to that on 11 weeks.Feeding on high unsaturated-fatty acid diet after weaning may significantly reduce the body weight, body fat content, improve the abnormal blood glucose level in rats induced by high-fat diet. It was suggested that the high unsaturated-fatty acid diet can be reasonable for weaned rats and gene expression regulation may be involved in programming later obesity by early nutrition.",

        "abstract": "The present investigation was undertaken to gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which myricetin induces apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells. Myricetin caused the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, myricetin triggered translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax to the mitochondria, downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bad in the mitochondria. The present study also showed that myricetin promoted the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol followed by an increase in the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and the concomitant degradation of PARP protein. Additionally, western blot analysis showed that the Akt/p70s6k1 pathway was inhibited in myricetin-treated HepG2 cells, accordingly the phosphorylation of Bad at Ser136 was downregulated. Collectively, these findings indicate that myricetin induced apoptosis in HepG2 cell through mitochondria apoptotic pathway and Akt/p70s6k1/Bad signaling. Present results provide new information on the possible mechanisms for the anti-cancer activity of myricetin.",

Then all groups were fed with basic diet. After 2 weeks, rats from group A were randomly divided into groups A1 and A2, A1 was assigned to basic diet continuously and groups A2, B, C were fed with high-fat diet for 6 weeks. 8 rats from each group were sacrified at the end of different treatments to detect serum glucose, TG and hormones dynamicly.High nonsaturated fat diet after weaning significantly reduced the body weight, body fat content, increased the sensitiveness to insulin, the levels of glucagons, FT4, FT3, improved leptin resistance in rats fed with high-fat diet. High-protein diet also reduced body weight, body fat content and increase lipolysis in rats fed with high-fat diet, but blood glucose in which group was higher than in group A2.High non-saturated fat diet after weaning can significantly reduce the obesity of rats fed with high-fat diet.",

        "abstract": "Adipose tissue is functionally composed of brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue. The unique thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue results from expression of uncoupling protein 1 in the mitochondrial inner membrane. On the basis of recent findings that adult humans have functionally active brown adipose tissue, it is now recognized as playing a much more important role in human metabolism than was previously thought. More importantly, brown-like adipocytes can be recruited in white adipose tissue upon environmental stimulation and pharmacologic treatment, and this change is associated with increased energy expenditure, contributing to a lean and healthy phenotype. Thus, the promotion of brown-like adipocyte development in white adipose tissue offers novel possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat obesity and related metabolic diseases. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the recruitment of brown-like adipocyte in white adipose tissue.

        "abstract": "\u03b1-eleostearic acid (\u03b1-ESA) has been shown to possess antitumor activity in cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the antitumor effect of \u03b1-ESA in breast cancer cells showing different expression levels of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). \u03b1-ESA inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in the SKBR3 and T47D breast cancer cell lines. The mechanism by which cell growth was inhibited involved G0/G1 and G2/M cell cycle phase arrest. The MTT assay showed that SKBR3 cells are more sensitive to \u03b1-ESA compared to T47D cells. Western blot analysis revealed that \u03b1-ESA treatment not only reduced HER2/HER3 protein expression, but also increased the level of phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN), which led to decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt. Inactive Akt further reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)\u2011associated death promoter (BAD) proteins. Furthermore, the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was found to be reduced following \u03b1-ESA treatment. Notably, nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) was activated by \u03b1-ESA treatment. Data of the present study showed that the antitumor activity of \u03b1-ESA is at least partly mediated by reduction of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer protein level, activation of the Akt/BAD/Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway and inhibition of the Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 survival pathway in the two breast cancer cell lines investigated in this study. Therefore, \u03b1-ESA may be considered a beneficial dietary factor for the prevention and treatment of invasive breast cancer in cells overexpressing HER2.",

Method:Male Wistar rats weaned on 24 d were randomly divided into A, B,C,D groups and were fed carbohydrate (basic), high protein, high unsaturated fatty acid and high saturated fatty acid diet respectively. After 3w, all rats were assigned to basic diet for 2w, and then rats from A group were randomly divided into groups A1 and A2. A1 was fed on basic diet continuously. Groups A2 ,B,C,D were assigned to high-fat diet for 6w. Body weight, body fat, blood glucose and FT4 ,and CPT-\u2160mRNA were observed in eight rats of every group. Results:Body weight, body fat and FT4 level in C group were significantly lower than those in A2 on 11w(P<0.05).The body weight, body fat were lower, but FT4 level and blood glucose were higher in B group significantly than those in A2(P<0.05). The body weight was lower in D group significantly than that in A2, but body fat , blood glucose and FT4 were not different from those in A2 significantly. The CPT-\u2160mRNA level in C group was persistently increased during experiment. Conclusion:Early feeding of high unsaturated fatty acid diet in rats may significantly reduce the body weight, body fat content and inhibit obesity incidence by higher free thyroid hormone ,through increase of CPT-\u2160gene expression.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is a malignant disease with poor outcome, which has led to a search for new therapeutics. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/raf/Erk pathways are key regulators of tumor growth and survival. In the present study, their roles were evaluated by MTT assay, flow cytometry and Western blotting in lung cancer cells. We found that a high efficacy of antitumor activity was shown with GDC-0941 treatment in two gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, A549 and H460. In addition, H460 cells with activating mutations of PIK3CA were relatively more sensitive to GDC-0941 than A549 cells with wild-type PIK3CA. Furthermore, GDC-0941 was highly efficacious in combination with U0126 in inducing cell growth inhibition, G0-G1 arrest and cell apoptosis. These antitumor activities of combined treatment may be attributed to the alterations of G0-G1 phase regulators, apoptosis-related proteins and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), induced by concomitant blockade of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/raf/Erk pathways. In conclusion, this study suggests that multi\u2011targeted intervention is the most effective treatment for tumors. Additionally, the blockade of PI3K, mTOR and Erk with GDC-0941 and MEK inhibitors shows promise for treating gefitinib-resistant NSCLC.",

In the present study, clear antitumor activity was observed with PI-103 treatment in two gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, A549 and H460, by simultaneously inhibiting p70s6k phosporylation and Akt phosphorylation in response to mTOR inhibition. In addition, H460 cells with activating mutations of PIK3CA were more sensitive to PI-103 than A549 cells with wild-type PIK3CA. PI-103 was found to inhibit growth by causing G0-G1 arrest in A549 and H460 cells. Western blotting showed that PI-103 induced down-regulation of cyclin D1 and E1 and simultaneously up-regulated p21 and p27, associated with arrest in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, p53, the tumor suppressor which transcriptionally regulates p21, was also upregulated with PI-103 treatment. Collectively, our results suggest that multitargeted intervention is the most effective tumor therapy, and the cooperative blockade of PI3Kalpha and mTOR with PI-103 shows promise for treating gefitinib-resistant NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the effects of different diet compositions after weaning on the body fat content and hormone-sensitive lipase gene expression in rats fed with high-fat diet. Methods Male Wistar rats weaned at 24 days were randomly divided into A,B,C,D groups and were fed on high carbohydrate, i.e. basic diet, high protein, high unsaturated fat and high saturated fat composition diet respectively. After 3 weeks, all rats were assigned to basic diet for 2 weeks later,then rats from A group were randomly divided into A1 and A2 subgroups. A1 subgroup was fed on basic diet continuously. A2 subgroup with B,C,and D groups was assigned to high-fat diet for 6 weeks.8 rats from each group were sacrificed at the end of different treatments to detect body weight,body fat content and blood glucose level. RT-PCR were used to determined the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase in white adipose tissue. Results Body weight,body fat content and blood glucose level in C group were significantly lower than that in A2 subgoup on 11w(P<0.05). The body weight,body fat content in B2 group were significantly lower than that in A2 subgoup(P<0.05),but blood glucose level was higher than A2 subgoup on 11w(P>0.05). The body weight in D group were significantly lower than that in A2 subgoup(P<0.05),but body fat content and blood glucose level was no significantly lower than A2 subgoup on 11w(P>0.05). The expression of HSL in B2 and C group was higher on 9 w and 11w respectively. The HSL mRNA level in all groups on 3w were similar to that on 11w. Conclusions Feeding on high unsaturated-fat composition diet after weaning may significantly reduce the body weight, body fat content, improve the abnormal glucose metabolism in rats induced by high-fat diet. It was suggested that the high unsaturated-fat composition diet can be reseanable for weaned rats and gene expression regulation may be involved in programming obesity in adulthood by early nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the effects of serum on anticancer activity of DHA and its antitumor mechanism. Method The growth inhibition of DHA on lung cancer A549 cells,and the effect of DHA on serum-induced protein kinase B(Akt)activation were assessed by MTT and Western blot respectively. Results DHA markedly induced growth inhibition of A549 cells in low concentration of serum,but promoted growth of A549 cells in high concentration of serum. DHA significantly blocked serum-induced activation of Akt in serum-free medium. Conclusion Serum is obviously against DHA-mediated growth inhibition of A549 cells,and DHA inhibits activation of Akt by lipid peroxidation and blocks growth of A549 cells.",

        "abstract": "Myricetin, a naturally occurring flavonol, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human hepatoma HepG2 cells and to induce G2/M phase arrest. However, the underlying mechanisms of Myricetin activity have yet to be revealed. The aim of the present study was to clarify the molecular mechanisms of cell cycle arrest induced by myricetin in HepG2 cells. The MTT assay confirmed that exposure of HepG2 cells to myricetin triggered G2/M phase arrest. Western blot analysis showed that myricetin increased the protein levels of the p53/p21 cascade, and markedly decreased Cdc2 and cyclin B1 protein levels in HepG2 cells. Additionally, myricetin treatment resulted in the up-regulation of Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylated (inactive) Cdc2 and p27, and the down-regulation of CDK7 kinase protein, as well as CDK7-mediated Thr161 phosphorylated (active) Cdc2. These data indicate that a decrease in cyclin B/Cdc2 complex activity mediated G2/M phase arrest induced by myricetin in HepG2 cells. This novel finding provides insight into the potential applications of myricetin in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

However, it is still a challenge to find reliable biomarkers and to understand their molecular mechanisms in GC. In this study, we first confirmed that LINC00941was up-regulated in GC tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues by RT-PCR, and found that the expression level of LINC00941 was correlated with invasion depth, lymphatic metastasis, and the TNM stage of patients with GC. Furthermore, by performing enrichment analysis based on the co-expression network and regulatory network, we found that LINC00941 was associated with cancer related biological processes such as cell cycle, cell communication, cell migration, cell division, as well as processes associated with the immune system. Our results suggested that LINC00941 may be a potential novel biomarker for therapeutic or diagnostic of GC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Although n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exhibit biological activity in many inflammatory diseases, their renoprotective effects against diabetic nephropathy (DN) have been controversial. Here, fat-1 transgenic mice were used to investigate the effects of n-3 PUFAs on streptozocin (STZ)-induced DN. Fat-1 mice exhibited increased renal n-3 PUFAs and n-3 PUFA-derived lipid mediators, compared to wild type (WT) mice. Endogenous n-3 PUFAs protected STZ-treated fat-1 mice against hyperglycemia-induced renal dysfunction, as reflected by significant decreases in kidney/body weight ratio, urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen levels and creatinine clearance. In addition, endogenous n-3 PUFAs significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia-induced renal damage by modulating E-cadhein expression. It was also found that DN-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was attenuated by endogenous n-3 PUFAs in STZ-treated fat-1 mice. Our findings suggest that endogenous n-3 PUFAs ameliorate DN potentially through the: (i) formation of n-3 lipid mediators, (ii) induction of E-cadherin expression and (iii) inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.",

Here the effects of DHA (0, 50, 100, 150\u2009\u00b5M) on the apoptosis of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes was investigated in order to elucidate potential mechanisms. It was shown that DHA decreased adipocyte viability, induced apoptosis, and reduced the cellular lipid content. DHA treatment also caused mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss and caspase-3 activation, as well as the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bad and an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Additionally, treatment with DHA down-regulated the levels of CREB, total Akt, p-Akt, total ERK, and p-ERK. Our data confirmed that DHA induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that the CREB/Akt and ERK signalling pathways were involved in DHA-triggered apoptosis, which provides new information for the development of anti-obesity strategies.",

The results showed that the content of Na+ significantly increased while K+ content decreased, then the ion balance was broken. The relative absorption of salt ions and nutritional elements were reflected in the variations of Na+ content and the ratios of Na+/ K+. Na+ content in root and the ratios of Na+/ K+ in shoot in Q1 (Qingli) were significantly higher than those in H2 (Heimi pumpkin), H3 (Cucurbita ficifolia). From these results, it could be inferred that the variation tendency of Na+ content and the ratios of Na+/ K+ in shoot of different pumpkin cultivar seedlings were nearly in consistent with the salt injury index of those under NaCl stress. This further proved that strong salt-tolerance of Q1 was related to the low ratios of Na +/ K+ in shoot and the high content of K+ ions under salt stress. The sensitivity of H2 and H3 to salt was connected with the high ratios of Na+/ K+ in shoot, and the low content of K+ ions under salt stress.",

Due to overfishing,environmental pollution,water conservancy,human production activities and other causes, wild Chinese Catfish has declined rapidly. Its fishery resource has been gradually exhausted in the Huaihe River Basin in the past decades. In order to analyze the genetic structure and demographic history of S. asotus,the mitochondrial cytochrome b ( Cyt b) gene sequences were used in the study. The results showed that Cyt b gene sequence contained 841 bp nucleotides and the T,C,A and G contents were 28. 59% ,29. 55% ,27. 44% and 14. 42% ,respectively. A total of 40 nucleotide sites and 32 haplotypes were obtained from 121 individuals collected in 7 different regions,including Xinyang,Huaibin,Bengbu,Hongze Lake,Yinghe River,Pihe River and Chihe River. The average haplotype diversity ( h) and nucleotide diversity ( P i ) were 0. 884 8,0. 003 8,respectively,showing that there was a high level genetic diversity in the populations of S. asotus from Huaihe River basin. The AMOVA analysis ( total F st = 0. 115 0 ) and the level of N m values ( 3. 58 ) ,as well as the average K2-P distances ( 0. 002 - 0. 009 ) all revealed that the S. asotus had no obviously geographical differentiation. However,the phylogenetic tree estimated by neighbor-joining ( NJ) method indicated that the individuals of S. asotus formed two monophyletic lineages, and the two lineages were not correlated with geographical populations.

The results showed that, low dosages of methoxyfenozide could inhibited the growth of insect, significantly decreased larval and pupal weight compared with control. Nutrient indicators showed that, the relative growth rate (RGR), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), relative consumption rate (RCR) and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) were significantly lower than control, and the approximate digestibility (AD) of larvae was significantly higher than control. According to the comprehensive evaluation, low dosages of methoxyfenozide could significantly inhibited the growth of Spodoptera litura.",

The results showed that the survival rate of the white seed pumpkin stock on grafted muskmelon was up to 85.3%-90.6%, and the growth of the grafted combination seedlings was better than that of the own-rooted muskmelon seedlings. The incidence of Fusarium oxysporumf sp.Cucumerinum on grafted muskmelon plant was significantly reduced by 1.8%-8.0%. The grafted combinations could increase production by 5.3%-60.8%, significantly higher than the own-rooted muskmelon. The grafted muskmelon contained lower soluble sugar but higher Vitamin C,crude protein and crude fiber than the own-rooted muskmelon. According to the comprehensive evaluation,\u2018Nanzhen 1\u2019stock and\u2018Zhuang Shi\u2019stock could be recommended as the good rootstock for\u2018XinShengYu\u2019muskmelon.",

Methods A total of 120 two-month-old male SD rats (body mass 200 ~ 220 g) were randomly assigned to 3 groups; an operation group (80 rats) had thoracotomy, with open pericardium and ligature of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery; a sham operation group (20 rats) had thoracotomy and open pericardium but no ligature of the artery; and a normal group (20 rats) had no treatment. We observed the general state of the rats every day after the operation, and we measured the rats' body mass the day before the operation and at the end of 6th week after the operation. To evaluate the change of heart function in heart failure rats, echocardiography was used to detect the level of BNP after the operation. Results The operation group that survived showed obvious objective sign of heart failure about 10 days after the surgery. Compared with the normal group and the sham operation group, left ventricle index in the operation group got higher, left ventricle posterior wall index and interventricular septum index got lower, fraction short-ening and ejection fraction got lower (P <0. 05 ) . There was no difference in the left atrium index ( P > 0.05 ). The BNP level was significantly increased (P < 0. 05 ), which was inversely related to ejection fraction and fraction shortening ( r = - 0. 927, r = - 0. 894, P < 0. 05, respectively ) . The BNP level also had a positive relationship with the left ventricle index ( r=0.409, P<0.05). Conclusion Ligature of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery in rats can successfully create heart failure model. Echocardiography can well evaluate the heart function in heart failure rat models.",

The patients in group A were administrated with the batroxobin,i.v.,10 U for 1st day,and 5 U for 2nd and 3rd day totally for thee days;and Yinxingdamo 30 ml,i.v.,once a day for 14 days totally. The patients in group B were administrated with Yinxingdamo 30 ml,i.v.,once a day for 14 days totally. And the patients in group C were administrated with the batroxobin,i.v.,10 U for 1st day,and 5 U for 2nd and 3rd day totally for thee days. Platelet count,prothrombin time (PT),activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT),Fibrinogen (FIB) were examined before and after the treatment. Nerve function damage degree grading was carried on before and after the treatment.Results Among the three groups there was no significant difference in neurological impairment score before and after the treatment (P>0.05). no significant difference in FIB before the treatment (P>0.05),but there was in FIB after treatment (P<0.01). In clinical effect there was statistically significant difference among the three groups after the treatment (P<0.01),and so was between group A and group B,and group A and group C (P<0.01).Conclusion Combined application of batroxobin and yinxingdamo can obviously reduce the anemic brain damage,improve the degree of nerve function damage,decrease the FIB level,with a action to protect the brain. The combined use of batroxobin and yinxingdamo is better than single use of each one.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the relationship between serum C-reactive protein(CRP) and the severity and stability of the diseased coronary artery. Methods Of 193 patients undergone coronary angiography, 61 patients with no evidence of coronary artery stenosis were set as control group, 132 patients with angiographically proven coronary heart disease(CHD) were set as case group. The extent and severity scale of coronary artery stenosis was quantitatively assessed according to coronary angiography by Gensini score (GS). The differences of serum CRP of each group were compared; the relationship between CRP and severity of coronary artery disease was analyzed. Results CRP of CHD group was significant higher than the control group(p<0.01), so did ACS group to SAP group(p<0.01) and control group(p<0.01), but there had no significant difference between the SAP group and control group(p>0.05); CRP had a significant association with GS in CHD group(r=0.34,p<0.001), which independent of age, total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) ratio, body mass index and smoking index (partial r=0.30,p<0.01); multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that CRP and TC/HDL ratio had significant influence to GS in CHD group (both p<0.001), the CRP was significant higher in double diseased coronary artery group than the single diseased coronary artery group (p<0.05), so did the three to single (p<0.05), but there was no significance difference between three and double (p>0.05). Conclusion CRP was an important predict of CHD, which closely associated with the severity and stability of coronary artery disease too.",

The results show that the crystallization rate of the LLDPE resins increases and the spherulite size decreases with the rise in the amount and dispersity of the nucleating agents, as a result, the roughness of the LLDPE films declines. The nucleating agent VP-401E has higher dispersity in the LLDPE matrix, which contributes to the excellent nucleating effect. The LLDPE films have finer spherullite and their surface becomes smoother with the increasing of the amount and dispersity of the nucleating agents. Consequently, the haze of the LLDPE films is lowered from internal and surface aspects and the transparency of the LLDPE films is improved.",

The volume swelling of the elastomer after immerging in oil at 100 \u2103 for 70 hours is only 28%. The micro-morphology of the elastomer was studied under transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope.

Morphology observation with TEM showed that the morphology of PP/PSBR TPE was similar to that of thermoplastic vulcanizate prepared by dynamic vulcanization method, and the PSBR particles were dispersed in PP matrix. The properties of the obtained PP/PSBR TPE were affected by the type of PP differing in copolymer or homopolymer, relative molecular mass,content of PP and the degree of the crosslinking of PSBR. According to the study on the melt rheology, the obtained PP/ PSBR TPE had pseudoplastic flow properties, and the content of PSBR had little effect on their rheological characteristic. Crystallization behaviour of PP matrix in PP/PSBR TPE was studied by DSC. Comparing with raw PP, the crystallization temperature of the PP matrix in PP/ PSBR TPE increased, showing that PSBR acted as a heterogeneous nucleating agent.",

The crystallization temperature, isothermal crystallization kinetics and non-isothermal melting behavior of PP modified with the composite \u03b2 nucleating agent and the aromatic amide nucleating agent were analyzed and compared by differential scanning calorimetry(DSC). The ultra-fine full-vulcanized powdered rubber particles in the composite \u03b2 nucleating agent acted as an assistant dispersing agent that facilitated the aromatic amide to be dispersed more homogeneously together with the rubber particles in the PP matrix, and thereby significantly enhanced the nucleating efficiency of the composite \u03b2 nucleating agent. The composite \u03b2 nucleating agent containing a small amount of aromatic amide could obviously increase crystallization rate of PP and simultaneously, brought about a high proportion of \u03b2-form crystal. The optimal mass fraction of the composite \u03b2 nucleating agent added into PP was 0.15%.",

        "abstract": "The film extrusion blowing experiments of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) were performed through different width of die gaps (die gap 1 mm and 2 mm). The tear strength and haze of the blown films were tested. The results indicate that the width of the die gaps has different influences on the blown films of LDPE and LLDPE. The haze and tear strength in machine and transverse direction of the LLDPE film prepared by the narrow die gap are superior to those of the film by the wide die gap. Therefore, the narrow die gap is suitable to blow LLDPE film. The haze, transparency and tear strength of LDPE film prepared by the wide die gap are better than those of the film by the narrow die gap. Consequently, wide die gap is appropriate for film blowing of LDPE.",

        "title": "Ultrafine full-vulcanized powdered rubbers/PVC compounds with higher toughness and higher heat resistance",
        "abstract": "A new type of rigid PVC compound with higher toughness and higher heat resistance was prepared by using a new type of PVC modifier, ultrafine full-vulcanized powdered rubber (UFPR). The UFPRs used in this paper were butadiene nitrile UFPR-1 (NBR-UFPR-1) with particle size of about 150 nm and butadiene nitrile UFPR-2 (NBR-UFPR-2) with particle size of about 90 nm. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) showed that glass transition temperature ( T g ) of PVC in compounds increased from 77.52 \u00b0C of neat PVC to 82.37 and 85.67 \u00b0C, while the notched impact strengths increased from 3.1 kJ/m 2 of neat PVC to 5.2, 5.5 kJ/m 2 , respectively. It can be found that both T g and toughness of PVC have been improved simultaneously, and the smaller the particle size of NBR-UFPRs, the higher the T g and the impact strength. The property could be attributed to larger interface and more interfacial interaction between NBR-UFPRs and PVC matrix. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that NBR-UFPRs could be well dispersed in PVC matrix. Keywords Rigid PVC/UFPR compounds Toughening Glass transition temperature 1 Introduction Rigid PVC has been widely used in construction, transportation, and many other industries due to its high stiffness, flame retardancy, chemical resistance and low cost [1] . However, the disadvantages of rigid PVC, such as low notch impact strength and low heat resistance, have restricted its application. Rubbers like NBR, acrylic rubber, chloride\u2013butadiene rubber etc. can improve the toughness of PVC [2\u20134] , but decrease its heat resistance. PVC toughened by NBR, commercialized by Advance Solvents and Chemical Corporation of USA 60 years ago, was the first toughened PVC compound [5] . Research results [6\u201312] had shown that PVC and NBR are fairly compatible, and the compatibility increased with the increase of acrylonitrile content (within the range 23\u201345%) in NBR. As a partly compatible system, there are two T g s in PVC/NBR compounds, the lower one corresponding to NBR phase and the higher one corresponding to PVC phases [7\u201310] . Unfortunately, the T g of PVC in PVC/NBR compounds is always lower than that in neat PVC, which means the toughness improvement of PVC toughened by NBR is always on the sacrifice of heat resistance. The rigid PVC's application has been markedly restricted because of this disadvantage, especially in the case of window profile. Therefore, it is very important and very difficult to improve both toughness and heat resistance of rigid PVC simultaneously by using NBR. A new type of PVC/NBR compound with both higher toughness and higher T g was introduced in this paper. The NBR used in this paper was a novel powdered NBR, ultrafine full-vulcanized powdered NBR (NBR-UFPR). The NBR-UFPR, prepared by combined technologies of irradiation and spray drying, had special microstructure, very high crosslinking degree on the surface of the NBR particles and moderate crosslinking degree in the inner parts [13,14] . 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials and sample preparation Table 1 lists the materials used in this paper. Five per hundred parts of rubber (phr) TMPTA was added dropwise into DQ-248 and DQ-6387 NBR-latex during stirring. After stirring for 1 h, the two kinds of mixed NBR latices were irradiated with a 60 cobalt-source. Two types of NBR-UFPRs, NBR-UFPR-1 (abbreviated as P-248) and NBR-UFPR-2 (abbreviated as P-6387), were obtained after spray drying. PVC (100 phr), NBR-UFPRs (8 phr), thermolite \u00ae 890 (5 phr), ACR-401 (1 phr), G60 (0.8 phr) and PE wax (0.3 phr) were firstly premixed in a high speed mixer with the mixing temperature in the range 70\u2013110 \u00b0C. Then the cooled mixture was blended in an internal mixer (Brabender PLE 651) at 175 \u00b0C for 8 min at a speed of 45 rpm. The two samples, PVC/P-248 compound with 8 phr P-248 (PVC-1) and PVC/P-6387 compound with 8 phr P-6387 (PVC-2), were compressed into 4 and 2 mm thick sheets at 200 \u00b0C and 7 MPa for 6 min. The 4 mm thick samples were machined into notched impact specimens (GB/T 1843-1996, 80\u00d710\u00d74 mm 3 ); the 2 mm thick samples were machined into dynamic mechanical thermal analysis specimens (45\u00d76\u00d72 mm 3 ) and tensile test specimens (GB/T 16421-1996, 75\u00d710\u00d72 mm 3 ). The TEM specimens were also cut from the compressed sheets. 2.2 Experimental measurements The notched impact strengths were measured at room temperature by using a CEAST impact machine according to GB/T 1843-1996. The tensile test was performed at room temperature according to GB/T 16421-1996. Dynamic mechanical thermal properties were tested in an American Rheometric Scientific DMTA V machine, and scans of temperature from \u2212100 to 150 \u00b0C with a ramp rate of 5.0 \u00b0C/min in dual cantilever mode at a frequency of 1.0 Hz. Morphology of the PVC/UFPRs compounds was observed with a TEM, Philips Tecnai 20; ultrathin sections, about 50\u2013100 nm thick, was microtomed at \u221280 \u00b0C before being stained with osmium tetroxide (OsO 4 ). Fracture surface morphology of notched impact specimen was observed on an environmental scanning electron microscope, Philips XL-30 ESEM, and the fracture surfaces were sputter-coated with a thin gold layer before observation. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a) and (b) are the log tan \u03b4 \u223ctemperature curves of PVC, NBR-UFPRs and PVC/ NBR-UFPR compounds. There were two peaks that correspond to the T g s of PVC and NBR-UFPR in log tan \u03b4 \u223ctemperature curves of PVC/NBR-UFPR compounds. It was surprising to find that the T g s of PVC in both samples of PVC-1 and PVC-2 were higher than that of neat PVC. This result was contrary to those of PVC compounds modified by conventional NBR rubber. For example, Zakrzewski [10] found that conventional NBR rubber reduced the T g s of PVC from 74 to 62 and 42 \u00b0C corresponding to 10 and 30 phr NBR. Moreover, the T g of PVC was 82.4 \u00b0C in the sample of PVC-1 in which the particle size of NBR-UFPR was about 150 nm, and 85.7 \u00b0C in PVC-2 in which the particle size of NBR-UFPR was 90 nm. It is interesting to know why the special rubber particle, NBR-UFPR, can increase the heat resistance and why the smaller the particle size of NBR-UFPR, the higher the T g of PVC in PVC/NBR-UFPR compounds. It had been found that good dispersion of NBR-UFPRs in PVC matrix ensure larger interface between NBR-UFPR and PVC matrix ( Fig. 2 ). Therefore, there existed more interfacial interaction between NBR-UFPRs and PVC matrix in PVC/NBR-UFPR compounds. We had found that interface played a key role in heat resistance of plastic/UFPR compounds and large interface and strong interfacial interaction between UFPR and epoxy resin could increase the heat resistance of epoxy/UFPR composite [15] . Moreover, we found in this paper that PVC-2 with NBR particle size of 90 nm had higher T g than PVC-1 with NBR particle size of 150 nm. Therefore, it is understandable that interface plays an important role in heat resistance of PVC/UFPR compounds and the larger interface between NBR-UFPRs and PVC matrix in PVC/UFPR compounds can increase the T g of PVC. NBR-UFPR was also in favor of the toughness of the PVC/UFPR compounds as shown in Table 2 . Compared with neat PVC, the increment of impact strength of PVC-1 and PVC-2 are 67 and 77%, respectively. It was interesting to find that the increment caused by UFPR with particle size of 90 nm was 10% more than that by UFPR with particle size of 150 nm. Although the result is of the same view with Bucknall's opinion of rubber-toughened PVC that the optimum rubber particle size for PVC should be less than 100 nm [2] , it is still difficult to understand that the impact strength of PVC-2 with smaller rubber particle size was higher than that of PVC-1. It is well known that energy absorption mechanism of rubber particles consists of not only rubber cavitation, tearing, and debonding but also crazing and deformation of matrix caused by rubber particles [2,16\u201320] . PVC deformation could be probably the key factor for explaining the increased toughness of PVC compounds in this study. The probability that a craze meets a rubber particle and is extended by that rubber particle is bigger when the rubber particle size is smaller because the smaller the rubber particle, the shorter the distance between rubber particles when same amount of rubber is used in rubber-toughened plastics. The average ligaments (distance between rubber particles) of PVC-1 and PVC-2 were 136 and 78 nm in the PVC/NBR-UFPR compounds according to Wu [21] . Therefore, there should be more extended crazes and less cracks in PVC-2 than in PVC-1. The SEM micrographs of the fracture surfaces of PVC-1 and PVC-2 in Fig. 3 did show us that there were less large cracks in PVC-2 than in PVC-1. It is also well known that the improvement of toughness comes at the cost of stiffness for most of plastic/rubber blends. However, the tensile strengths of PVC-1 and PVC-2 with improved toughness were also increased compared with that of neat PVC ( Table 2 ). The results need to be studied further. 4 Conclusion A new type of rigid PVC/NBR-UFPR compound has been successfully fabricated. The NBR-UFPRs could increase the toughness and heat resistance of rigid PVC simultaneously. Moreover, the smaller the particle size of NBR-UFPR, the higher the heat resistance and toughness of the PVC/UFPR compound. Images of TEM indicated that NBR-UFPRs were well dispersed in PVC matrix. The increased heat resistance had been attributed to larger interface between NBR-UFPRs and PVC matrix, whilst more craze extension had been used to explain the improved toughness. Further study is needed for understanding the reason that UFPR can increase the toughness and heat resistance of PVC at same time.

Appendix A The following equation derived by Wu [21] can be used to calculate the ligament thickness, \u03c4 (distance between two rubber particle surface) (A1) \u03c4 = D { ( \u03c0 ( 6 \u03d5 r ) ) 1 / 3 \u2212 1 } where D is the average rubber particle size and \u03d5 r is the rubber volume fraction. Thus, using D 1 (150 nm) of P-248 and D 2 (90 nm) of P-248, we can calculate the \u03c4 1 (136 nm) of PVC-1 and \u03c4 2 (78 nm) of PVC-2. References [1] W.V.

A traditional approach is to blend with rubber particles to enhance the toughness of PP yet modulus of PP decreases accordingly. Recently, we have achieved a good balance of toughness and stiffness of PP via blending PP with a small amount of elastomeric nano-particles (ENP). Based on our measurements, mechanical properties of the blends studied both the toughness of PP at room temperature and at \u221220 \u00b0C show substantial increase. On the other hand, the stiffness of the PP blends retains or even possesses a slight enhancement. One of the reasons for this improvement is due to the fact that the ENP is not only a toughening modifier but also a nucleation agent for the PP. The nucleation density of the blends increases, while the crystallization kinetics of the blends becomes faster compared with the pure PP samples.",

The fire performance of EVA and EVA composites was compared in this communication by cone calorimeter test (CCT). The CCT data indicated that the addition of NB-UFPR in EVA/nano-MH system not only reduced the heat release rate, but also prolonged the ignition time of the composite, which is contrary to the effect of NB-UFPR when it was added alone in EVA polymer. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that nano-MH accelerated the loss of acetic acid, but NB-UFPR assisted to reduce nano-MH's accelerating effect. FTIR spectra showed a new absorption at 3374 cm \u22121 in the blends of EVA/NB-UFPR and EVA/NB-UFPR/nano-MH.",

When the UFPSBR/Na-MMT nanocompound powder was mixed with crude SBR, the exfoliated Na-MMT was disorderly dispersed in the SBR matrix because of the carrier nature of the UFPSBR particle, which is compatible with SBR and disperses easily in the SBR matrix, and the SBR/UFPSBR/Na-MMT ternary nanocomposite was prepared. When compared with SBR/Na-MMT binary composites, the SBR/UFPSBR/Na-MMT ternary nanocomposite has a shorter vulcanization time, higher strength, and better flame retardancy because of the good dispersion of exfoliated Na-MMT in the SBR matrix with a Na-MMT loading range of 4 phr.

        "abstract": "A combined rubber system of ultrafine full-vulcanized powdered rubber (UFPR) and SBS was used for polypropylene toughening. The PP toughened with the combined rubber system shows not only higher impact strength as compared to each rubber component used alone but also good stiffness and heat resistance. Crystallization study shows that the UFPR is more efficient in promoting the crystallization of PP than SBS, leading to a higher crystallinity and an enhancement of stiffness and heat resistance of PP. The combined rubber system containing UFPR and a small amount of SBS still possesses a good nucleating ability. Transmission electron microscopy results indicate that the combined rubber system mostly forms an encapsulation structure of UFPR particles encapsulated by SBS phase. This morphology was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy results through observing the fracture surfaces of toughened samples. A small amount of SBS was found to be helpful for a better dispersion of UFPR in PP matrix. The causes for the encapsulation morphology and the synergistic toughening effect were discussed. A tentative explanation was given by comparison of the solubility parameter of each component in the toughened samples.",

Phenol formaldehyde resin was selected as carbon precursor to prepare this catalyst. Ni Al alloy powder (48\u202fwt% Ni) and powdery phenol formaldehyde resin were mixed firstly, and then the mixture was compressed, cured and carbonized, followed by alkaline leaching. The prepared carbon-composed catalyst possesses high stiffness, good hydrogen adsorption capacity, and perfect catalytic property. Hydrogenation of n-butyraldehyde to n-butanol was selected as a probe reaction. Compared with commercial catalyst, this cage-like carbon-composed Raney Nickel catalyst exhibits much higher selectivity and similar catalytic activity. It is believed that the use of carbon composing method will make a series of Raney metal catalysts, including but not limited to Raney nickel, Raney cobalt, and Raney copper, very important fix-bed catalysts for chemical industry.",

The phenolic resin is modified with organic elastomeric nanoparticles including nitrile butadiene and carboxylic nitrile butadiene rubbers. TEM images show that the elastomeric nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in phenolic matrix with a diameter of about 100 nm. SEM photographs show that large quantity of microcracks, initiated by nanoparticles, exist on fracture surface. These microcracks can dissipate impact energy and improve the impact property of phenolic composite. FTIR analysis and curing reaction kinetics analysis confirm that the excellent thermal property is due to the existence of special interface between nanoparticles and phenolic matrix.",

When the UFPNBR/HNCC nanocompound powder is mixed with crude NBR, UFPNBR particles are easily dispersed well in NBR matrix because of their good compatibility, thus the HNCC particles are also dispersed in NBR matrix because of the carrier aidance of UFPNBR particles in 7 phr HNCC loading range, then the novel NBR/UFPNBR/HNCC ternary nanocomposites is fabricated. Compared with NBR/organic reagent-treated HNCC (ONCC) binary composites, the NBR/UFPNBR/HNCC ternary nanocomposites has shorter vulcanization time and better properties of abrasive resistance, oil resistance, dynamic compression properties and flame retardancy in fire. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Of significance, this paper reported a finding that rubber-modified plastics with a special morphology could enhance toughness and heat resistance cooperatively. The special morphology was such that an interface in situ formed between plastic matrix and rubber particle had higher hardness than plastic matrix. As a result, the hard interface not only helped rubber soft component integrate with plastic matrix by covalent bonds to impart plastic matrix high toughness, but also covered rubber nanoparticles as hard shells to protect them from deforming at high temperature. The special morphology had been achieved in rubber-modified epoxies and phenolic molding material. The forming mechanism of the hard interface was studied in detail with AFM, DSC and in situ FTIR, by using rubber-modified epoxy resin as an example. The finding could be applied to any rubber-modified plastics as long as the special morphology could be realized. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

It is found that carboxylic styrene-butadiene ultra-fine full-vulcanized powdered rubber (CSB-UFPR) could behave as a nucleating agent for nylon-6 crystallization, which can increase the crystallization temperature, the onset temperature of crystallization as well as the glass transition temperature of nylon-6 confined in the hybrid of nylon-6 and ultra-fine full-vulcanized powdered rubber. It is also found that nylon-6 molecules confined among CSB-UFPR particles favor the crystalline form of \u03b3 than that of \u03b1. The crystallization process of \u03b3 phase of nylon-6 in nylon-6/CSB-UFPR hybrid is a diffusion-controlled process, and thus it can be accelerated by raising the crystallization temperature or by extending oil into CSB-UFPR. It is expected that these results will benefit the research on crystallization behavior of other constrained geometry polymer, such as ultra-thin film and polymer/clay hybrid, and etc.",

With the addition of 16 phr URP, the percolation threshold of PA6/MWCNT composites was reduced from 6 phr MWCNTs to 3 phr. Besides, at a constant loading of 4 phr MWCNTs, increase of URP loading led to two changes and a plateau for the volume resistivity of composites. The morphological observations of composites revealed that the decrease of volume resistivity was attributed to both homogenous dispersion and stretching of MWCNTs in PA6. The mechanism on better dispersion and stretching of MWCNTs with the help of URP was also given. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

It was found that all of the three UFPRs used in the study can help the silicate layers without organic treatment to be exfoliated in the nylon-6 matrix, despite some differences in compatibilities between them and nylon-6. Accordingly, the clay in different UFPRMs at the same loading content can lead to a similar improvement in stiffness and heat resistance of nanocomposites. In other words, UFPRs having different compatibilities with nylon-6 do not affect the stiffness and heat resistance of nanocomposites largely. However, the nylon-6 nanocomposites, modified with different UFPRMs, show different superior properties. Butadiene styrene vinyl-pyridine UFPRM (VP-UFPRM) is more effective in improving toughness of nylon-6. Nylon-6/silicone UFPRM (nylon-6/S-UFPRM) nanocomposite exhibits more reduced flammability, good flowability and high thermal stability. As for nylon-6/acrylate UFPRM (nylon-6/A-UFPRM) nanocomposite, it shows high toughness and thermal stability. Furthermore, the mechanism of unmodified clay exfoliation during the melt compounding and the effect of different UFPRs on the properties of the nylon-6/UFPRM nanocomposites are also discussed.",

The special compound powder of crosslinked rubber/nano-MH was prepared by co-spray drying the fluid mixture of nano-MH slurry and irradiated rubber latex. The cone testing results showed that the new flame-retardant ternary composite had better flame retardancy than the composite obtained by conventional process, such as longer \u201cTime to ignition\u201d and lower \u201cmean heat release rate in initial time\u201d. Thermogravimetry and transmission electron microscope were used to analyze the reason of different flame retardancy. It is found that more uniform dispersion of nano-MH in the new ternary composite than in conventional one maybe the main reason for better flame retardancy.",

Interestingly, the PVC ternary nanocomposites excel corresponding PVC binary ones, as well as neat rigid PVC, in both heat resistance and toughness due to the synergistic effect of UNCC and NBR-UFPR.",

It was found that the unmodified clay was fully exfoliated and uniformly dispersed in the resulting nanocomposite. Characterizations of mechanical properties revealed that the impact strength of this special epoxy/rubber/clay nanocomposite increased up 107% over the neat epoxy resin. Thermal analyses showed that thermal stability of the nanocomposite was much better than that of epoxy nanocomposite based on organically modified clay.",

The radiation crosslinking reaction of PDMS occurs in the inner phase of the latex and is relatively isolated from the water phase. Therefore the oxygen and the radicals produced by the radiolysis reaction of water almost have no effect on the crosslinking reaction of polymer. The experimental data correspond with the Charlesby-Pinner relationship in the main. The gelation doses, degree of crosslinking and degradation as well as G values of crosslinking were calculated. From them, the sensitization coefficients were derived to offer a quantitative measurement of the enhancing effect of sensitizer on the radiation crosslinking. \u00a9 2004 Springer-Verlag.",

A series of novel nano-rubber particles (UFPR) were introduced, which were prepared through irradiating common rubber lattices and spray drying them. Epoxies toughened with UFPR showed a much better toughening effect than those with CTBN, and the heat resistance of epoxy was unexpectedly elevated. For polypropylene toughening, UFPR can improve the toughness, stiffness and heat resistance of PP simultaneously. These special toughening effects overcome the deficiencies in rubber toughening technology and are worth further investigating.",

The flammability of the ternary composite was studied by cone calorimeter test (CCT). Synergistic effect on flame retardancy was found between silicone rubber and NMH. EVA/CFR ternary nanocomposite showed the lowest peak heat release rate (PHRR) and mass loss rate (MLR) among the samples of virgin EVA, EVA composites. The synergistic flame retardancy of silicone rubber and NMH in EVA system is attributed to the enhanced char layers in the condensed phase that prevents the heat and mass transfer in the fire. \u00a9 2007 World Scientific.",

An ideal morphology with controlled localization of MWCNTs in continuous LLDPE matrix and appropriate size of finely-dispersed UFRP can be achieved at the same time. The controlled localization of MWCNTs in the continuous phase facilitates the formation of conductive pathway, and thus the volume resistivity of the as-prepared LLDPE/UFRP/MWCNTs thermoplastic vulcanizates is significantly decreased. The results show that both the blend ratio of LLDPE/UFRP and the loading of MWCNTs have remarkable effect on the volume resistivity. Significantly, the electrically conductive TPVs exhibit good mechanical properties duo to the fine dispersion of UFRP in LLDPE. The added MWCNTs are capable of imparting reinforcement effects to thermoplastic vulcanizates with just a slight loss of stretchability and elasticity.",

It was found that the nucleating agent decelerated the PE nonisothermal crystallization process. NA did enhance the nucleating rates for both PE and PP, but the linear growth rate dominated the volumetric growth rate for PE, and the volumetric growth rate dominated the overall crystallization rate. That is why PE nucleated with NA had a slower overall crystallization rate than the neat one.",

        "abstract": "Organic conjugated polymers with low energy bandgaps are emerging as a particular class of near-infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion materials. However, these polymers routinely possess high phase transition temperatures due to the rigid skeleton and strong intermolecular interactions. Conjugated polymers can rarely be thermally processed at low temperature, especially below 100\u2009\u00b0C. This work formulates a concept of post-darkening modeling production (p-DMP) by which the thermoplastic non-conjugated trans-polyisoprene (TPI) is refreshed into a photothermal conversion material with high light use efficiency. Two steps, including the customizable shaping at low temperature and iodine vapor-tailored \"darkening\", ensure the ease of preparing photothermal conversion devices with desirable topologies. A few characterizations, with the combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide reasonable explanations for understanding the \"darkening\" process of TPI in iodine atmosphere. In particular, the p-DMP is successfully extended to three-dimension (3D) printing, opening an avenue to fabricate personalized photothermal products, for example, a sunlight-directed physiotherapy device for healthcare of articular tissues.",

Strong PL from poly[(maleic anhydride)-alt-(vinyl acetate)] (PMV) from low-cost monomer has been found in organic solvents, yet the necessity of noxious solvents would hinder its practical applications. Herein, through a novel, eco-friendly, and one-step route, PMV-derived PL polymers can be fabricated with the highest quantum yield of 87% among water-soluble nonconjugated PL polymers ever reported. These PMV-derived polymers emit strong blue emission in both solutions and solids, and can be transformed into red-emission agents easily. These PL polymers exhibit application potentials in light-conversion agricultural films. It is assumed that this work not only puts forward a convenient preparation routine for nonconjugated polymers with high PL, but also provides an industrial application possibility for them.",

These polymers, which contain both bulky carboxylic ester groups and metal carboxylate groups, are found to be dual-emission photoluminescent, with a blue luminescence excitation-dependent group and a red luminescence excitation-independent group. These photoluminescence polymers with a nonconjugated structure and dual chromophores also show characteristics of aggregation-induced emission (AIE). The luminous intensities of the AIE fibers prepared using the polymers are found to increase after stretching, in contrast to traditional photoluminescent fibers with the aggregation-caused quenching property. The study also finds that the stretched fibers can emit the three primary colors when irradiated by ultraviolet, blue, and green light.",

In order to overcome the insurmountable weakness of current conductive/anti-static polymer fibers, a new type of conductive/anti-static fiber has been developed by using low melting point alloy (LMPA) as the conductive filler. The metal filament filled conductive/anti-static fibers perform much better than normal fibers because drawing could make their conductive networks denser instead of destroying them. Another notable finding of our research is that blending of nonconductive montmorillonite could improve the dispersity and stability of metal filaments, and further the conductivity of the polymer fibers. Based on this method, a composite polypropylene fiber with 2\u00a0vol% LMPA and 2\u00a0vol% carbon nanotubes is fabricated, of which the resistivity can be as low as 8.3\u00d710 4 \u00a0\u03a9\u00a0m.",

        "abstract": "A newly-developed polyamide supported Raney Ni catalyst, which is suitable for use in fix-bed reactions with high selectivity, was studied in this paper. Selective hydrogenation of acetone to isopropanol was chosen as a probe reaction. It has been found that clean preparation of isopropanol could be achieved, that is to say, the two main byproducts (isopropyl ether and methyl- iso-butyl carbinol) could be eliminated with the newly-developed polyamide supported Raney Ni catalyst. The elimination of these side reactions was attributed to the adsorption effect of polyamide support and a model was proposed. The proposed model was further proved by hydroamination reaction of acetone. According to this model, catalyst support can play an important role in chemical reactions. Different products could be produced when different catalyst support is used, the main reaction and side reactions can even be reversed sometimes when the chemicals, active component of catalyst and reaction condition are the same. This model could help to improve catalytic selectivity of many Raney metal catalysts used routinely in chemical and oil refining industry, and is also useful for hydrogenation reactions in pharmaceutical and food industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the present work, the uniaxial deformation of 1-hexene based Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) cast film at slow to very fast stretching speed (initial strain rate 10 \u22123  to 8.3\u202fs \u22121 ) was investigated, together with a high speed video camera for capturing craze morphologies. The structural evolution of the deformed film at different speeds was also studied with Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Very different tensile behavior is observed when the film is stretched at very fast speed. Voids are detected by SAXS for slow MD and TD stretching processes; but no visible crazes are observed. However, visible crazes appear starting at a small satrain of 0.3 during fast MD stretching, due to the film being more rigid when stretched at the fast speed. The crazes appear with the length direction being perpendicular to the stretching direction and propagate quickly in the length direction. The crazes appear almost everywhere in the film during the fast MD stretching, while only occur in the central region during the fast TD stretching due to the preferred crystal orientation in MD direction where crazes can propagate more easily and faster. The structure transition at lamellar level is much faster during the fast stretching process, due to the formation of the visible crazes. The leaning is helpful for better understanding puncture, dart and tear tests of PE films, where the films undergo the fast deformation.",

Our new finding shows that pH-value can affect the aggregation of poly(maleic anhydride-alt-vinyl acetate) (PMV) derivatives in aqueous solution. Based on this new finding, a new group of low-cost AIE photoluminescent PMV derivatives with tunable emission from cyan to red were prepared by simply mixing PMV with different concentrations of NaOH aqueous solution. The yellow photoluminescent derivative has been found to have a similar emission with YAG:Ce, a common rare earth phosphor for White light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). A pure white emission with a Commission International de l\u2019Eclairage 1931 of (0.33, 0.34) can be obtained by combining yellow emission derivative with a blue LED chip. WLEDs with a controllable correlated color temperature from cold white (7215 K) to warm white (3486 K) can be fabricated with the new PMV derivatives coated on UV or blue LED chips. This is the first report of AIE photoluminescent polymers that can replace the rare-earth coating on LED chips for White light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). Besides, the new group of low-cost AIE photoluminescent PMV derivatives with tunable emission can also be used as fluorescent dyes for polymer films, fibers and hydrogels with different colors.",

This solid grafting reaction at high temperature can be achieved by using microwave which selectively heats the substance that can absorb microwave. Maleic acid-grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA) was prepared by this new method. It is well known that polypropylene (PP) is transparent to microwave while maleic anhydride (MAH) can be heated by microwave. Under microwave irradiation, MAH dispersed in the micropores of PP spherical powder can absorb microwave to generate high temperature and cause PP nearby and MAH itself to generate free radicals. MAH-grafted PP (PP-g-MAH) can be prepared without using an initiator. The new method has many advantages that traditional methods do not have. For example, the prepared graft polymer has no initiator and MAH residue and thus is odorless; the prepared graft polymer also has excellent mechanical properties because ...",

        "abstract": "A conductive graphene-melamine sponge prepared via microwave irradiation is reported in this paper. Graphene oxide supported on melamine sponge was pre-reduced firstly at 100 \u00b0C and then further reduced in a household microwave oven at over 1000 \u00b0C. It was surprise to find that graphene oxide on melamine sponge was reduced perfectly while the three-dimensional structure of melamine sponge was kept well after high temperature reduction via microwave irradiation. Slightly pyrolysis of melamine sponge was also found during 5 seconds microwave-irradiation, leading to the nitrogen generated from the pyrolysis of melamine sponge being doped into graphene, which could benefit the electric conductivity of the prepared graphene-melamine sponge. The electric conductivity of the prepared graphene-melamine sponge is about 0.12-1.0 S/m due to the high reduction degree of graphene oxide and nitrogen doping. On the other hand, different from pure melamine sponge, the newly developed conductive graphene-melamine sponge possesses superhydrophobic and super-oleophilic properties. Overall, the newly developed conductive graphene-melamine sponge contained 94.3 wt. % melamine sponge and 5.7 wt. % N-doped graphene is a cost-effective material with good elasticity, high conductivity, super-hydrophobicity and super-oleophilicity.",

For example, a polyamide 6-supported Raney nickel catalyst provided a 100.0% conversion of n-butyraldehyde without producing any detectable n-butyl ether, the main byproduct in industry, and eliminated the two main byproducts (isopropyl ether and methyl-iso-butylcarbinol) in the hydrogenation of acetone to isopropanol. Meanwhile, a model for how the polymer support brought about the elimination of byproducts is proposed and confirmed. In this account the preparation and applications of polymer-supported Raney catalysts along with the corresponding models will be reviewed.",

In the method, the powder of low melting point metal alloy (LMPA) is filled into the PE matrix by using twin screw extruder at a temperature below the melting point of the LMPA, and followed by a die drawing process at a temperature around the melting point of the metal alloy. It has been found that die drawing process, repeating the die drawing process and adding nano-fillers, such as montmorillonite (MMT) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), all help reduce the metal particle size in the PE matrix, thus improve the conductivity of the composite. The conductivity improvement is attributed to an increased number of the smaller metal particles. Therefore, conductive composites of polymer/metal alloy/nano-filler with high conductivity are possible to be prepared by using the new method.",

The effect of sedimentary deposit on gaseous phase combustion was analyzed. The results show that the reason why the boron-based fuel-rich propellant at low pressure keeps stable combustion with high burning rate and high pressure exponent is existence of sedimentary deposit; in essence, the combustion model is from continuation of BDP model. The special combustion phenomenon of boron-based fuel-rich propellant at low pressure was qualitatively explained by using the combustion model.",

Results show that DIANP makes the rigidity of NC molecular weaken and its plasticity enhance. This effect of DIANP to NC is better than NG. The mechanical properties (various modulus) of NC/DIANP blends have a relation to binding energies. The greater binding energy corresponds to higher mechanical modulus, which is due to a stronger interaction force between NC and NG compared with DIANP.",

        "abstract": "For better combustion performance of high burning rate composite modified double base(CMDB)propellant with ACP, a novel fast-burning energetic coordination compound of copper(\u2161) salt with one of triazole derivatives, ACP particles were coated with polyurethane adhesive. The thermal decomposition behaviors of ACP and coated ACP were studied by thermogravimetry (TG), and their effects on combustion performance of CMDB propellant in the pressure region of 11-20.5 MPa (high pressure range) and 3-9 MPa (low pressure range) were comparatively studied. Experimental results show that the thermal decomposition process of ACP or coated ACP includes four phases, and total loss of weight after decomposition are 90.70% and 76.22%, respectively. ACP and coated ACP are effective to enhance burning rates under low and high pressure and have about the same increments, and led to burning rate exponents enhancement under low pressure but reduction under high pressure. The propellants containing coated ACP show about 0.1 decrease in burning rate pressure exponent under high and low pressure in comparison with that of containing uncoated ACP with the same content in propellant. The experimental results indicate that the coating agent on the surface of ACP particles plays an important role in the thermal decomposition behaviors of ACP and affects combustion properties of propellants.",

Its structure was determined by elemental analysis, X-ray fluorescence and FT-IR spectra. The thermal decomposition mechanism and kinetic parameters of the decomposition reaction for Zr(3-NO2-PHT)2\u00b72H2O were investigated by temperature-programmed TG-DTG and condensed-phase thermolysis/FT- IR techniques. A kinetic equation for the decomposition reaction was obtained. The results showed that Zr(3-NO2-PHT)\u00b72 2H2O underwent a four-stage decomposition process and that the main decomposition reaction occurred during the second process. The apparent activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A) of the main decomposition reaction are 158.84 kJ\u00b7mol-1 and 109.85 s-1, respectively. The kinetic equation can thus be expressed as: d\u03b1/dt=109.85(1-\u03b1)e-1.91\u00d7104/T.",

It is considered that the combustion surface and the heat feedback of the propellant are increased by addition of ACP,leading that the increasing of burning rate of the propellant.",

In order to realize the proper testing of combustion heat, some fireproof materials' characteristics and their application in the combustion heat testing of fuel-rich propellant were studied. Those fireproof materials include acid washing asbestos, C/C compound materials, Al2O3 chinaware and tungsten crucible. The results show that the C/C compound materials have heat reaction while the acid washing asbestos, Al2O3 chinaware, and tungsten do not have heat reaction under high temperature and oxygen atmosphere. The application of three kinds of fireproof materials in testing the fuel-rich propellant's combustion heat show: Al2O3 chinaware can be used for only one time; spreading the acid washing asbestos in the tungsten crucible can improve the experimental value which is 94% theoretical value.",

The initial decomposition pathways were also proposed on the basis of molecular dynamic simulation. The goal is to find the mutual relationships among the physical models, decomposition pathways, and the impact sensitivities for BCHMX and its PBXs. It has been shown that the physical model of the first step of BCHMX thermolysis is close to first order and the second step is governed by a first order autocatalytic model, which turns to \"2D or 3D Nucleation and Growth\" models under the effect of polymeric binders probably due to their hindrances on topochemical reaction of BCHMX. Simulation results show that the scission of N-NO2 is the initial step for BCHMX pyrolysis, followed by HONO and HNO eliminations, where the latter is due to nitro-nitrite rearrangement. Under the effect of hydrocarbon polymers, the HONO/HON elimination and collapse of ring structure of BCHMX occur earlier without changing the time for N-NO2 scission, which might be the reason why those polymers have little effect on the thermal stability of BCHMX, while they could make it decompose almost in a single complex step.",

The results show that the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G\u2033) increase significantly, G' and G\u2033 increase to the maximum and level off, and then G' is higher than G\u2033. In the addition, the infrared characteristic frequency decreases due to change of H-bond of NC/NG blends in plasticizing process. Besides, according to the calculation results of Molecular Dynamics simulation, it is revealed that the free volume of NC molecule is increased by the steric hindrance effect of NG molecule, and the H-bond can be formed between NG and NC molecules instead of H-bond in the individual NC molecule, thus increasing the radius of gyration of NC.",

Feasible experimental method was put forward. The results show that the oxygen bomb parts were not ablated by combustion and the ingredient in the propellant can be burnt completely in the improved oxygen bomb.

The effect of Mg/Al mechanical alloy on the combustion mechanism was discussed. The combustion physical model of propellant was established. The results show that the substitution of Mg/Al mechanical alloy in propellant for Al powder makes the burning rate increase, pressure index decrease, combustion efficiency of Al increase, thermal decomposition sensitivity enhance, decomposition enthalpy decrease and the agglomerate of Al disappear.",

        "abstract": "The well-known R0 implication is developed to pseudo-De Morgan algebras, which is called generalized pseudo-R0 implication. The notion of strong pseudo-De Morgan algebras is introduced, and its elementary properties are discussed. Secondly, two necessary and sufficient conditions are proved as follows: (1) A pseudo-De Morgan algebra A with generalized pseudo-R0 implication becomes a pseudo-involutive pseudo-BCK algebra if and only if A is a strong pseudo-De Morgan algebra. (2) A pseudo-De Morgan algebra A with generalized pseudo-R0 implication and corresponding operator becomes a pseudo-regular residuated lattice if and only if A is a strong pseudo-De Morgan algebra. Finally, all pseudo-De Morgan algebras, strong pseudo-De Morgan algebras and proper pseudo-involutive pseudo-BCK algebras are obtained by MATLAB software when the order number is smaller than or equal to 8. Furthermore, starting with bounded distributive lattices, we discussed the classification problem of lower-order pseudo-involutive pseudo-BCK algebras.",

Second, the new concepts of weak neutrosophic duplet, weak neutrosophic duplet set, and weak neutrosophic duplet semi-group are introduced, some examples are given by using the mathematical software MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA), and the characterizations of cancellable weak neutrosophic duplet semi-groups are established. Third, the cancellable neutrosophic triplet groups are investigated, and the following important result is proven: the concept of cancellable neutrosophic triplet group and group coincide. Finally, the neutrosophic triplets and weak neutrosophic duplets in BCI-algebras are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The new notion of a neutrosophic triplet group (NTG) is proposed by Florentin Smarandache; it is a new algebraic structure different from the classical group. The aim of this paper is to further expand this new concept and to study its application in related logic algebra systems. Some new notions of left (right)-quasi neutrosophic triplet loops and left (right)-quasi neutrosophic triplet groups are introduced, and some properties are presented. As a corollary of these properties, the following important result are proved: for any commutative neutrosophic triplet group, its every element has a unique neutral element. Moreover, some left (right)-quasi neutrosophic triplet structures in BE-algebras and generalized BE-algebras (including CI-algebras and pseudo CI-algebras) are established, and the adjoint semigroups of the BE-algebras and generalized BE-algebras are investigated for the first time.",

At first, the existing two definitions of inclusion relation (called type-1 and type-2 inclusion relation, respectively) of neutrosophic sets are analyzed, and the deficiencies of type-1 and type-2 inclusion relations are illustrated by examples (in fact, they are actually two extreme cases). Second, a new definition of inclusion relation of neutrosophic sets (call it type-3 inclusion relation) is introduced, and a new method of ranking of neutrosophic sets is given. The effectiveness of the ranking method is presented by some application examples in multiple attribute decision making. Finally, type-3 inclusion relation of neutrosophic sets and related lattice structure are investigated in a systematic way, the definitions of type-3 union and type-3 intersection operations are proposed, and the following important result is proved: all of neutrosophic sets based on a certainty domain constitute a generalized De Morgan algebra (non-distributive lattice) with respect to type-3 union, type-3 intersection and complement operations. From this, the essential difference between neutrosophic set and fuzzy set (and intuitionistic fuzzy set) is clarified theoretically.",

Secondly,wavelet transformation based three-level lifting for the carrier image is conducted.

Finally,by taking corners as root nodes,all the corresponding high frequency coefficients are extracted. Inverse operation of embedding watermark is performed with those coefficients.

A local extreme of the product was reported as comer when the value of the product exceeded a threshold. The features of contour at different scales were contained in multi-scale product which enhanced the responses of corners while suppressing the effect of noise, hence the proposed algorithm not only has good localization accuracy, but also has good robustness to noise.

Therefore,this paper presents a novel algorithm to design the descriptor of image feature points based on differential histograms under polar coordinates (HWDH).Firstly,the neighbor area of feature point is divided into nine small patches. Then,Gradient differential is produced by harr wavelet on every small patch and a dominant direction of the feature point is computed by Scale Adapted Harris detector which is improved. Lastly,histogram is generated from the differential statistic. In contrast to other descriptor based on differential histograms,the description generated by our algorithm needn't to rotate in the around area of feature point.

However, these methods incorporating the category information such as Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA), face small sample problems. In order to take over these disadvantages, the paper proposes a novel approach to extract the facial features called Two-Dimension Nonnegative Partial Least Squares(2DNPLS). The main idea of the approach is grabbing the local features via adding the constraint of nonnegative to 2DPLS, which makes the approach gain not only the advantages of 2DPLS, incorporating both inherent structure and category information of images, but also the local features, having nonnegative interpretability. For evaluating the approach's performance,a series of experiments are conducted on two famous face image databases ORL, Yale face databases, which demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-art algorithms.",

This paper introduces the non-negative properties into 2-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA), and then proposes a novel 2-dimensional projective non-negative matrix factorization (2DPNMF) for face recognition. 2DPNMF preserves the local structure of face images but breaks through the restriction of minimizing the loss function of non-negative matrix factorization. Since 2DPNMF only needs calculating the projection matrix (base matrix), its computational complexity is greatly reduced. This paper theoretically proves the convergence of the proposed algorithm and uses YALE face database, FERET face database, and AR face database for the comparison experiments. Experimental results show that 2DPNMF has higher recognition performance as well as a much faster speed than NMF and 2DPCA. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Acta Automatica Sinica. All rights reserved.",

Since adaptive non-maximal suppression eliminated lots of potential matching points, condition theory was applied to control the number of initial interest points. The bad conditioned points were eliminated, so the computational complexity of the following process was decreased and the efficiency of the algorithm was improved. Meanwhile, matching points were mostly kept. Features under the control of condition theory were called well conditioned features. Since the location of initial Harris corner had offset and false corners were produced, sub-pixel localization technique was used to determine the location of corners, and the false and unstable corners were eliminated in this process. PCA-SIFT was applied to describe the feature points and their neighbors to get vectors. Finally, Euclidean distance between vectors was used to determine whether two points match or not. Experimental results show that the efficiency is improved significantly, the proposed algorithm is good at feature matching, and has good robustness to geometrical transformations, image noise and illumination change.",

        "abstract": "Manifold learning is a new kind of algorithm originating from the field of machine learning to find the intrinsic dimensionality of numerous and complex data and to extract most important information from the raw data to develop a regression or classification model. The basic assumption of the manifold learning is that the high-dimensional data measured from the same object using some devices must reside on a manifold with much lower dimensions determined by a few properties of the object. While NIR spectra are characterized by their high dimensions and complicated band assignment, the authors may assume that the NIR spectra of the same kind of substances with different chemical concentrations should reside on a manifold with much lower dimensions determined by the concentrations, according to the above assumption. As one of the best known algorithms of manifold learning, locally linear embedding (LLE) further assumes that the underlying manifold is locally linear. So, every data point in the manifold should be a linear combination of its neighbors. Based on the above assumptions, the present paper proposes a new algorithm named least square locally weighted regression (LS-LWR), which is a kind of LWR with weights determined by the least squares instead of a predefined function. Then, the NIR spectra of glucose solutions with various concentrations are measured using a NIR spectrometer and LS-LWR is verified by predicting the concentrations of glucose solutions quantitatively. Compared with the existing algorithms such as principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR), the LS-LWR has better predictability measured by the standard error of prediction (SEP) and generates an elegant model with good stability and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "A novel license plate localization algorithm is presented based on the saliency map. The feature maps with respect to intensity, color and orientation are firstly extracted from the input color RGB image by using the bottom-up visual attention model. Moreover, these feature maps are combined into a saliency map. After the binarization of saliency map, several plate candidates are obtained. Then, vertical edges, the aspect ratio, and hopping frequency of the brightness of the license plate region are used to eliminate the undesired candidates and determine the real license plate region. The comparison experimentations show that the proposed method can reduce the pseudo-plate number due to the background environment and have strong environmental adaptability, anti-noise ability as well as high localization rate.",

In this paper, the multi-resolution idea is introduced into the Harris algorithm, and the wavelet-based formula for measuring the image intensity variation is developed, meanwhile, the auto-correlation matrix is obtained that reflected the scale variation information. Then, a novel Harris multi-scale corner detection algorithm wavelet-based is presented, which might detect the corners in different scales and overcome the drawback that the single-scale Harris detector usually leads to either missing significant corners or detecting false corners due to noise. Compared with Harris algorithm, the presented algorithm is more efficient in detecting the corners with accurate location and is robust with respect to noise.",

The algorithm starts with extracting the contour of the object of interest, and then computes the curvature of this contour with Gaussian derivative filters at various scales. Local extremes of the product of the curvatures at different scales are reported as corners when the value of the product exceeds a threshold. The proposed detector is based on the well-known curvature scale-space, but improves on it in two ways: first, since the finest scale is part of the scale product, there is no need for coarse-to-fine corner tracking. Second, since many scales are involved, false positive/negative detections are unlikely even with a single threshold. Finally, the comparison between the proposed approach and other corner detectors shows that our approach is more competitive with respect to CCN and ACU criteria under similarity and affine transforms. Moreover, a number of experiments also illustrate that the scale product corner detection has more robustness for noise.",

A simple iterative algorithm is also provided for calculating design parameters based on LMI techniques.

Several robust stabilities of time-varying systems with parametric uncertainties, such as general robust stability, robustly asymptotical stability and exponential stability, are studied using uniformly positive definite matrix functions and the Lyapunov method. Specifically, robust stability conditions of time-invariant impulsive T-S fuzzy systems are also derived in the formulation of quasi-linear matrix inequalities (QLMIs) and an iterative LMIs algorithm is designed for solving QLMIs. Finally, a unified chaotic system with continuous periodic switch and a unified time-invariant chaotic system are used for demonstrating the effectiveness of our respective results.",

The main difference between the proposed control strategy and PDC lies in that the subsystems are the linear impulsive ones and the overall model of the system is the time-varying impulsive control one. Thus, the stability analysis and control design problems of presented system can be reduced to the ones of impulsive control systems. So, the stability issues of the proposed control system are investigated via comparison criterion of differential equations. Finally, the numerical simulations for the chaotic system verify the effectiveness of the proposed design method.",

Unlike the conventional SRC algorithms, CSSRC defines each class as a group and then impels these groups to compete for representing the test sample. To achieve such property, CSSRC imposes a L1-norm constraint to the classes for compulsively selecting the most relevant classes and introduces a L2-norm constraint to the samples belonging to the same class for making sure that all homogeneous samples can be sufficiently exploited for representation. Since CSSRC is a typical structure sparse representation issue, it can be efficiently solved by the convex optimization. Seven popular visual and audio signal databases are employed for evaluation. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in comparison with the state-of-the-art classifiers.",

In this paper, we propose a new type of combination to give full play to the role of residuals and inception, making network learning more abundant features. The new proposed module is called Residual Inception (RI) which enjoys the same width as the inception module in GoogLeNet. In RI, each parallel cascade structure is replaced by a densely block or a modified residual block for gaining a better performance and a lower computational cost.

        "abstract": "Successfully onboarding open source projects in GitHub is difficult for developers, because it is time-consuming for them to search an expected project by a few query words from numerous repositories, and developers suffer from various social and technical barriers in joined projects. Frequently failed onboarding postpones developers' development schedule, and the evolutionary progress of open source projects. To mitigate developers' costly efforts for onboarding, we propose a ranking model NNLRank (Neural Network for List-wise Ranking) to recommend projects that developers are likely to contribute many commits. Based on 9 measured project features, NNLRank learns a ranking function (represented by a neural network, optimized by a list-wise ranking loss function) to score a list of candidate projects, where top-n scored candidates are recommended to a target developer. We evaluate NNLRank by 2044 succeeded onboarding decisions from GitHub developers, comparing with a related model LP (Link Prediction), and 3 other typical ranking models. Results show that NNLRank can provide developers with effective recommendation, substantially outperforming baselines.\n\n",

Contribution to open source can be rewarding for developers and advocates the evolutionary progress of the open-source software. However, finding a suitable project to contribute can be intimidating for developers because of the enormous possible choices. Due to various social and technical barriers, developers might fail to contribute successfully. Frequent unsuccessful onboarding hampers not only developers\u2019 individual advancement but also the evolutionary progress of open-source projects. To mitigate developers\u2019 costly efforts for onboarding, we propose a learning-to-rank model, neural network for list-wise ranking (NNLRank), to recommend projects that developers are likely to contribute. NNLRank leverages project features and developers\u2019 experience to recommend projects for onboarding. We develop an efficient approach to optimize the neural network where we leverage a list-wise loss function which intends to minimize the difference between the predicted projects list and the ground-truth list preferred by developers. We evaluate NNLRank with 2044 successful onboarding decisions from GitHub and compare it with three standard learning-to-rank models and a prior onboarding tool. Experimental results show that NNLRank can provide effective and efficient onboarding recommendation to developers, substantially outperforming the previous models.",

        "abstract": "Human face contains abundant shape features. This fact motivates a lot of shape feature-based face detection and three-dimensional (3D) face recognition approaches. However, as far as we know, there is no prior low-level face representation which is purely based on shape feature proposed for conventional 2D (image-based) face recognition. In this study, the authors present a novel low-level shape-based face representation named `shape primitives histogram' (SPH) for face recognition. In this approach, the face images are separated into a number of tiny shape fragments and they reduce these shape fragments to several uniform atomic shape patterns called `shape primitives'. Then the face representation is obtained by implementing a histogram statistic of shape primitives in a local image region. To take scale information into consideration, they also produce multi-scale SPHs (MSPHs) by concatenating the SPHs extracted from different scales. Moreover, they experimentally study the influences of each stage of SPH computation on performance, concluding that a small cell with 1/2 overlap and a fine size block with 1/2 overlap are important for good results. Four popular face databases, namely ORL, AR, YaleB and LFW-a, are employed to evaluate SPH and MSPH. Surprisingly, such seemingly naive shape-based face representations outperform the state-of-the-art low-level face representations.",

Therefore, instead of directly constructing the graph Laplacian of samples, we firstly divide each subject data into a static part (subject-invariant part) and a dynamic part (intra-subject variations) and then jointly learn their graph Laplacians to yield a new graph Laplcian. We use this new graph Laplacian to replace the original graph Laplacian of Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) to present a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm. We name this algorithm Globality-Locality Preserving Projections (GLPP). Moreover, we also extend GLPP into a 2D version for dimensionality reduction of 2D data. Compared to LPP, the subspace learned by GLPP more precisely preserves the manifold structures of the data and is more robust to the noisy samples. We apply it to face recognition and gait recognition. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of GLPP in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

However, the high dimension of intensity used in AAM usually leads to an expensive storage and computational cost. Moreover, intensity values cannot provide enough information for image alignment. In this paper, we propose a new AAM method based on Gabor texture feature representation. Our contributions are two-fold. On one hand, based on the assumption that Gabor magnitude and Gabor phase follow a lognormal distribution and a general Gaussian distribution respectively, three simplified texture representations are proposed. One the other hand, we apply the proposed texture representations in AAM, which is the first time to extract statistical features from both Gabor magnitude and Gabor phase as the texture representation in AAM. Tests on public and our databases show that the proposed Gabor representations lead to more accurate and robust matching between model and images. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Although two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) extracts image features directly from 2D image matrices rather than one dimensional vectors, 2DPCA is only based on the whole images to preserve total variances by maximizing the trace of feature covariance matrix. Thus, 2DPCA cannot extract localized components, which are usually important for face recognition. Inspired by nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), which is based on localized features, we propose a novel algorithm for face recognition called two-dimensional nonnegative principal component analysis (2DNPCA) to extract localized components and maintain the maximal variance property of 2DPCA. 2DNPCA is a matrix-based algorithm to preserve the local structure of facial images and has the nonnegative constraint to learn localized components. Therefore, 2DNPCA has both advantages of 2DPCA and NMF. Furthermore, 2DNPCA solves the time-consuming problem by removing the restriction of minimizing the cost function and extracting only the base matrix. The nearest neighbor (NN) classifier and linear regression (LR) classifier are used for classification and extensive experimental results show that 2DNPCA plus NN and 2DNPCA plus LR are both very efficient approaches for face recognition. \u00a9 2012 2012 SPIE and IS&T.",

Then, a novel Harris multi-scale corner detection algorithm wavelet-based is presented, which might detect the corners in different scales and overcome the drawback that the single-scale Harris detector usually leads to either missing significant corners or detecting false corners due to noise.

        "abstract": "Abstract   As a commonly used data representation technique, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has received extensive attentions in the pattern recognition and machine learning communities over decades, since its working mechanism is in accordance with the way how the human brain recognizes objects. Inspired by the remarkable successes of manifold learning, more and more researchers attempt to incorporate the manifold learning into NMF for finding a compact representation,which uncovers the hidden semantics and respects the intrinsic geometric structure simultaneously. Graph regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (GNMF) is one of the representative approaches in this category. The core of such approach is the graph, since a good graph can accurately reveal the relations of samples which benefits the data geometric structure depiction. In this paper, we leverage the sparse representation to construct a sparse hypergraph for better capturing the manifold structure of data, and then impose the sparse hypergraph as a regularization to the NMF framework to present a novel GNMF algorithm called Sparse Hypergraph regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SHNMF). Since the sparse hypergraph inherits the merits of both the sparse representation and the hypergraph model, SHNMF enjoys more robustness and can better exploit the high-order discriminant manifold information for data representation. We apply our work to address the image clustering issue for evaluation. The experimental results on five popular image databases show the promising performances of the proposed approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art NMF algorithms.",

Firstly corners in an image are detected by multi-scale Harris operator, which are taken as initial interest points. And then sub-pixel localization technique is applied to determine the location of corners and eliminate the false and unstable corners. After that, CCSD of all corners is calculated, so matching corners can be obtained. Finally, RANSAC is used to estimate the parameters robustly based on initial matching. The experimental results illustrate the algorithm has a good performance of accuracy and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract    Context:  Previous studies have shown that a transfer learning model, TCA+ proposed by Nam et\u00a0al., can significantly improve the performance of cross-project defect prediction (CPDP). TCA+ achieves the improvement by reducing data distribution difference between source (training data) and target (testing data) projects. However, TCA+ is unstable, i.e., its performance varies largely when using different source projects to build prediction models. In practice, it is hard to choose a suitable source project to build the prediction model.   Objective:  To address the limitation of TCA+, we propose a two-phase transfer learning model (TPTL) for CPDP.   Method:  In the first phase, we propose a source project estimator (SPE) to automatically choose two source projects with the highest distribution similarity to a target project from candidates. Next, two source projects that are estimated to achieve the highest values of F1-score and cost-effectiveness are selected. In the second phase, we leverage TCA+ to build two prediction models based on the two selected projects and combine their prediction results to further improve the prediction performance.   Results:  We evaluate TPTL on 42 defect datasets from PROMISE repository, and compare it with two versions of TCA+ (TCA+_Rnd, randomly selecting one source project; TCA+_All, using all alternative source projects), a related source project selection model TDS proposed by Herbold, a state-of-the-art CPDP model leveraging a log transformation (LT) method, and a transfer learning model Dycom with better form of TCA. Experiment results show that, on average across 42 datasets, TPTL respectively improves these baseline models by 19%, 5%, 36%, 27%, and 11% in terms of F1-score; by 64%, 92%, 71%, 11%, and 66% in terms of cost-effectiveness.   Conclusion:  The proposed TPTL model can solve the instability problem of TCA+, showing substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art and related CPDP models.",

        "abstract": "Software change-prone class prediction can enhance software decision making activities during software maintenance (e.g., resource allocating). Many change-prone class prediction approaches have been proposed and most are effective in inter- version prediction within a project. These approaches usually build a supervised prediction model by learning from historical labeled dataset. However, a major challenge which remains is that this typical change-prone prediction setting cannot be used for new projects or projects with limited historical data. To address this challenge, we propose to tackle this task by adopting a novel prediction method which has not been used in change- prone prediction, namely self-learning method. The key idea of the self-learning method is to enable the change-prone prediction on new projects or projects with limited historical dataset by learning from itself. In this paper, we apply a state-of-art self- learning method, CLAMI, to change-prone prediction. In addition, we propose a novel self-learning approach CLAMI+ by extending CLAMI. The experiments among 14 open source projects show that the self-learning methods achieve comparable results to four typical inter-version baselines and the proposed CLAMI+ slightly improves the CLAMI method on average.",

        "abstract": "Quality models are regarded as a well-accepted approach for assessing high-level abstract quality characteristics (e.g., maintainability) by aggregation from low-level metrics. However, most of the existing quality models adopt the weighted linear aggregation method which suffers from a lack of consensus in how to decide the correct weights. To address this issue, we present an automated aggregation method which adopts a kind of probabilistic weight instead of the subjective weight in previous aggregation methods. In particular, we utilize a topic modeling technique to estimate the probabilistic weight by learning from a software benchmark. In this manner, our approach can enable automated quality assessment by using the learned knowledge without manual effort. In addition, we conduct an application on the maintainability assessment of the systems in our benchmark. The result shows that our approach can reveal the maintainability well through a correlation analysis with the changed lines of code.",

        "abstract": "Static analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs) are widely used to detect potential defects in software development. A recent study suggests that there is a moderate correlation between the alerts reported by static analysis tools and software defects [1]. However, despite the actionable alerts reported by static analysis tools, they may report too many meaningless unactionable alerts. Actionable alert refers to the alert which is meaningful and fixable. Unactionable alert (i.e., false positive alert) refers to the alert which is regarded as unimportant to developers, inessential to source code, or will not be fixed by developers. Are all alerts (including both actionable and unactionable alerts) suitable for indicating software defects? To address this question, we classify all the alerts into two categories, namely actionable alerts and unactionable alerts. By the following, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the degree of correlation between defects and alerts on the evolution of three open source projects with totally 40 releases. The objective of the study is to explore two kinds of correlation analysis: one is the correlation between all the alerts reported by FindBugs and defects among the release history of a project, the other is the correlation between the actionable alerts and defects. As a result, we find that not all the alerts but the actionable alerts are suitable to be an early predictor of defects.",

However, extracting and rearranging the detected object trajectories is one of the difficult issues in generating video synopsis. In this paper, a method is proposed which used for solving the optimization problem of trajectory combination in generating video synopses. The method utilizes the temporal combination ways of trajectories to deal with the optimization problem of motion trajectory combination under the idea of genetic algorithm (GA). Experiment results show that combination of the trajectories based on GA is better than simulated annealing both in information loss and time consumption.

The programming question and answer (Q&A) websites like Stack Overflow gathered the knowledge and expertise of developers worldwide which reflects some insight into the development activities (e.g., NFRs), but the NFRs in the Q&A site are rarely investigated. ObjectiveOur research aims to aid comprehension on the actual thoughts and needs of the developers by analyzing the NFRs on Stack Overflow. MethodWe extracted the textual content of Stack Overflow discussions, and then we applied the topic modeling technique called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) helping us to discover the main topics of the corpus. Next, we labelled the topics with NFRs by the wordlists to analyze the hot, unresolved, difficult NFRs, and the evolutionary trends which involves the trends of the NFRs focus and NFRs difficulty. ResultsOur findings show that (1) The developers mostly discuss usability and reliability while discussing less on maintainability and efficiency. (2) The most unresolved problems also occurred in usability and reliability. (3) The visualization of the NFR evolutions over time shows the functionality and reliability attract more and more attention from developers and usability remains hot. (4) The NFRs investigation in specific technologies indicates the quality is a similar concern among different technologies and some NFRs are of more interest as time progresses. (5) The research on NFRs difficulty in specific technologies shows the maintainability is the most difficult NFR. In addition, the trends of the NFRs difficulty over time in the seven categories signal that we should focus more on usability to address them. ConclusionWe present an empirical study on 21.7 million posts and 32.5 million comments of Stack Overflow, and our research provides some guide to understand the NFRs through developers eyes.",

        "abstract": "The discovered topics have a one-to-one correspondence with category labels.The method performs both single-category and multi-category change classification.The method overcomes the ambiguity coming from manually assigning weights.The method is applicable to cross-project analysis without the need of re-learning. Accurate classification of software changes as corrective, adaptive and perfective can enhance software decision making activities. However, a major challenge which remains is how to automatically classify multi-category changes. This paper presents a discriminative Probability Latent Semantic Analysis (DPLSA) model with a novel initialization method which initializes the word distributions for different topics using labeled samples. This method creates a one-to-one correspondence between the discovered topics and the change categories. As a result, the discriminative semantic representation of the software change messages whose largest topic entry directly corresponds to the category label of the change message which is directly used to perform single-category and multi-category change classification. In the evaluation on five open source projects, the experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a more accurate performance than the four baseline methods. Especially with the multi-category classification task which improves the recall rate. Moreover, the different projects share the same vocabulary and the estimated model so that DPLSA is well applicable to cross-project software change message analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Context  Software change-prone class prediction can enhance software decision making activities during software maintenance (e.g., resource allocating). Researchers have proposed many change-prone class prediction approaches and most are effective on labeled datasets (projects with historical labeled data). These approaches usually build a supervised model by learning from historical labeled data. However, a major challenge is that this typical change-prone prediction setting cannot be used for unlabeled datasets (e.g., new projects or projects with limited historical data). Although the cross-project prediction is a solution on unlabeled dataset, it needs the prior labeled data from other projects and how to select the appropriate training project is a difficult task.    Objective  We aim to build a change-prone class prediction model on unlabeled datasets without the need of prior labeled data.    Method  We propose to tackle this task by adopting a state-of-art unsupervised method, namely CLAMI. In addition, we propose a novel unsupervised approach CLAMI+ by extending CLAMI. The key idea is to enable change-prone class prediction on unlabeled dataset by learning from itself.    Results  The experiments among 14 open source projects show that the unsupervised methods achieve comparable results to the typical supervised within-project and cross-project prediction baselines in average and the proposed CLAMI+ slightly improves the CLAMI method in average.    Conclusion  Our method discovers that it is effective for building change-prone class prediction model by using unsupervised method. It is convenient for practical usage in industry, since it does not need prior labeled data.",

        "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is one of the most frequently occurring childhood cancers. The rs2168101 G>T polymorphism observed in the  gene is located at a conserved GATA transcription factor binding motif. This polymorphism was reported to be significantly associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility. However, whether this and other functional polymorphisms can affect neuroblastoma risk of Chinese children remains unknown. We conducted a two-center hospital-based case-control study with a total of 374 cases and 812 controls to assess the role of five  gene polymorphisms in the neuroblastoma risk. We confirmed that rs2168101 G>T was significantly associated with decreased neuroblastoma risk for both northern and southern Chinese children and the combined subjects [GT vs. GG: adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.44-0.74, <0.0001; TT vs. GG: adjusted OR=0.29, 95% CI=0.15-0.56, =0.0002; GT/TT vs. GG: adjusted OR=0.53, 95% CI=0.41-0.68, <0.0001; and TT vs. GT/GG: adjusted OR=0.36, 95% CI=0.19-0.69, =0.002] after adjustment for age and gender. This association was further confirmed by performing a stratifying analysis and a false-positive report probability analysis. Similar results were observed for the rs3750952 G>C polymorphism. In summary, the current study confirmed that the potentially functional  rs2168101 G>T and rs3750952 G>C polymorphisms were associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility. This research requires further validation with larger sample sizes and inclusion of different ethnicities.",

        "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a pediatric malignancy, and the clinical phenotypes range from localized tumors with excellent outcomes to widely metastatic disease in which long-term survival is approximately 40%, despite intensive therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant miRNA regulation plays a role in neuroblastoma, but the miRNA functions and mechanisms remain unknown. miR-181 family members were detected in 32 neuroblastoma patients, and the effects of miR-181a/b on cell viability, invasion and migration were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. A parallel global mRNA expression profile was obtained for neuroblastoma cells overexpressing miR-181a. The potential targets of miR-181a/b were validated. miR-181a/b expression levels were positively associated with MYCN amplification and neuroblastoma aggressiveness. Moreover, ectopic miR-181a/b expression significantly induced the growth and invasion of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis revealed that mRNAs were consistently downregulated after miR-181a overexpression, leading to cell migration. In addition, the expression of ABI1 was suppressed by miR-181a/b, and ABI1 was validated as a direct target of miR-181a/b. We concluded that miR-181a/b were significantly upregulated in aggressive neuroblastoma, which enhanced its tumorigenesis and progression by suppressing the expression of ABI1.

        "abstract": "Software Quality model is a well-accepted way for assessing high-level quality characteristics (e.g., maintainability) by aggregation from low-level metrics. Aggregation method in a software quality model denotes how to aggregate low-level metrics to high-level quality characteristics. Most of the existing quality models adopt the weighted linear aggregation method. The main drawback of weighted linear method is that it suffers from a lack of consensus in how to decide the correct weights. To address this issue, we present an automated aggregation method which adopts a kind of probabilistic weight instead of the subjective weight in previous aggregation methods. In particular, we leverage a topic modeling technique to estimate the probabilistic weight by learning from a software benchmark.In this manner, our approach can enable automated quality assessment by using the learned probabilistic relationship without manual effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of proposed aggregation approach, we conduct an empirical study on assessing one typical high-level quality characteristic (i.e., maintainability) which is regarded as an important characteristic defined in ISO 9126. The achieved results on 10 open source projects with totally 269 versions show that our method can reveal maintainability well and it outperforms a weighted linear aggregation method baseline in most of the projects.",

        "abstract": "Background:  Software defect models can help software quality assurance teams to allocate testing or code review resources. A variety of techniques have been used to build defect prediction models, including supervised and unsupervised methods. Recently, Yang et al. [1] surprisingly find that unsupervised models can perform statistically significantly better than supervised models in effort-aware change-level defect prediction. However, little is known about relative performance of unsupervised and supervised models for effort-aware file-level defect prediction.  Goal:  Inspired by their work, we aim to investigate whether a similar finding holds in effort-aware file-level defect prediction.  Method:  We replicate Yang et al.u0027s study on PROMISE dataset with totally ten projects. We compare the effectiveness of unsupervised and supervised prediction models for effort-aware file-level defect prediction.  Results:  We find that the conclusion of Yang et al. [1] does not hold under within-project but holds under cross-project setting for file-level defect prediction. In addition, following the recommendations given by the best unsupervised model, developers needs to inspect statistically significantly more files than that of supervised models considering the same inspection effort (i.e., LOC).  Conclusions:  (a) Unsupervised models do not perform statistically significantly better than state-of-art supervised model under within-project setting, (b) Unsupervised models can perform statistically significantly better than state-of-art supervised model under cross-project setting, (c) We suggest that not only LOC but also number of files needed to be inspected should be considered when evaluating effort-aware file-level defect prediction models.",

        "abstract": "Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique, which has been widely used in many applications. Although, LDA is well-known for its discriminant capability, it clearly does not capture the geometric structure of the data. However, from the geometric perspective, the high-dimensional data resides on some low-dimensional manifolds in the sample space and these manifold structures are essential for data clustering and classification. In this paper, we propose a novel LDA algorithm named graph regularized linear discriminant analysis (GRLDA) to further improve the conventional LDA by incorporating such geometric information of data. GRLDA is achieved by penalizing the LDA with a Graph regularization, which is an affinity matrix encoding the geometric relationship of the data points. To take high-order geometric relationship among samples into consideration, we generalize GRLDA via using the hypergraph regularization instead of the graph regularization. We name this new version as hyper graph regularized linear discriminant analysis. Moreover, we exploit the null space of LDA via using an identity matrix to regularize the between-class scatter matrix. This strategy can further improve the discriminating power of LDA algorithms. Four popular face databases are used to evaluate our proposed LDA algorithms and the results of experiments demonstrate that they outperform the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction algorithms.",

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a classical multivariate statistical algorithm for data analysis. Its goal is to extract principal features or properties from data, and to represent them as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components. Although PCA has obtained extensive successes across almost all the scientific disciplines, it is clear that PCA cannot incorporate the supervised information such as class labels. In order to overcome this limitation, we present a novel methodology to combine the supervised information with PCA by discriminatively selecting the components. Our method use the fisher criterion to evaluate the discriminative abilities of bases of original PCA and find the first n best ones to yield the new PCA projections. Clearly, the proposed method is general to all PCA family algorithms and even can be applied to other unsupervised multivariate statistical algorithms. Furthermore, another desirable advantage of our method is that it doesn't break the original structure of the PCA components and thereby keeps their visual interpretability. As two examples, we apply our method to incorporate the supervise information with PCA and Robust Sparse PCA (RSPCA) to improve their discriminative abilities. Experimental results on two popular databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

The scheme represents the surfaces of the template as well as the target objects by spherical harmonics and computes a warp between these via a thin plate spline. To form the propagated s-rep, it applies the warp to the spokes of the template s-rep and then statistically refines. This automatic approach promises to make s-rep fitting robust for complicated objects, which allows s-rep based statistics to be available to all. The improvement in fitting and statistics is significant compared with the previous methods and in statistics compared with a state-of-the-art boundary based method.",

Most existing algorithms analyze the variation in pixels or regions for background subtraction. Unfortunately, these works ignoring the neighborhood information or similarity among pixels and do not work well in complex scenes. To solve this problem, a novel background subtraction method based on SuperPixels under Multi-Scale (SPMS) is proposed. In SPMS, the foreground consists of superpixels with foreground or background label, which decided by the statistic of its variation. The variation in superpixels is robust to noise and environmental changes, which endows the SPMS with the ability to work in extreme environment such as adverse weather and dynamic scenes. Finally, the summary of foregrounds under multiple scales improve the accuracy of the proposed approach. The experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate encouraging performance of the proposed approach in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms.",

In this paper, we proposed a new supervised manifold learning dimensionality reduction algorithm named Category Guided Sparse Preserving Projection (CG-SPP) which combines the global category information with the merits of sparse representation and Locality Preserving Projection (LPP). Besides the sparse graph Laplacian which preserves the intrinsic data structure of samples, a category guided graph is introduced to assist in better preserving the intrinsic data structure of subjects.

To mitigate developersu0027 costly efforts for onboarding, we propose a ranking model NNLRank (Neural Network for List-wise Ranking) to recommend projects that developers are likely to contribute many commits. Based on 9 measured project features, NNLRank learns a ranking function (represented by a neural network, optimized by a list-wise ranking loss function) to score a list of candidate projects, where top-n scored candidates are recommended to a target developer. We evaluate NNLRank by 2044 succeeded onboarding decisions from GitHub developers, comparing with a related model LP (Link Prediction), and 3 other typical ranking models.

        "abstract": "We present a graph-based classification approach called sparse graph-based inductive learning (SGIL). Different to the conventional graph-based classifiers, which perform the classification in a semisupervised way, SGIL is a purely supervised method whose classifier is totally learned in an inductive fashion instead of transductive fashion. Similar to the idea of sparse graph-based classifier, SGIL constructs a sparse graph to encode the correlations of training samples, and considers the classification issue as a regularized sparse graph partition issue where the optimal graph cut should not only minimize the correlation loss of the training samples but also minimize the classification errors. Essentially, the learned graph cut plays a role as the predicted labels here. Thus, a linear classifier can be inductively derived by learning a mapping between the training samples and the graph cuts. Since SGIL is purely supervised, it enjoys several desirable properties over the semisupervised ones in graph construction and model training. We evaluate our work on several popular image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate its superiority.",

        "abstract": "For benefiting from incorporating the class information, partial least squares (PLS) and its two dimension version (2DPLS) have been widely employed in face recognition when extracting principal components. However, currently popular statistic methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), only learn holistic, not parts-based, representations which ignore available local features for face recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract the facial features called two dimension nonnegative partial least squares (2DNPLS). Our approach can grab the local features via adding non-negativity constraint to the 2DPLS, and can also reserve the advantages of 2DPLS, which are both inherent structure and class information of images. For evaluating our approach's performance, a series of experiments were conducted on two famous face image databases include ORL and Yale face databases, which demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the compared state-of-art algorithms.",

Angle is an intuitive and important property for representing corners. This fact motivates us to present a novel angle-based corner detector, named Eigenvector-based Angle Estimator (EAE). EAE estimates the angle of each point in a contour via computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of boundary points over a small Region of Support (RoS). Since EAE is sensitive to uniform scaling due to the fixed RoS, an enhanced version of EAE named Weighted EAE (WEAE) is proposed. WEAE achieves robustness to uniform scaling by weighting the boundary points using their distances from the target point. Experimental results demonstrate that EAE and WEAE can efficiently achieve promising performance in comparisons with several recent state-of-the-art approaches under two commonly used evaluation metrics, namely, Average Repeatability (AR) and Localization Error (LE).",

However, the high expressivity of OCL makes manual inconsistency checking a difficult task. In addition, the developers cannot detect these problems by OCL itself due to its lack of automated reasoning support. We investigate an approach to translating OCL invariants into OWL 2 DL axioms. We do this where the OCL expression contained in an invariant is converted to the corresponding OWL 2 DL class expression in a compositional way. Our approach covers the OCL expressions including four: PrimaryExp, RelationalExp, LogicalExp and IfExp types. Considering the distinction between the CWA and OWA, we achieve correct translation from RelationalExp using closure axiom. Also, we employ an ontology design pattern to overcome the limitations of OWL 2 DL expressivity when translating IfExp. Then inconsistency checking is done through description logic reasoning by the OWL 2 DL high-performance reasoner. We construct an inductive proof to establish the correctness of our translation approach. Moreover, we evaluate our approach using the implemented TUCO tool prototype.",

        "abstract": "Currently, considerable efforts have been devoted to devise image representation. However, handcrafted methods need strong domain knowledge and show low generalization ability, and conventional feature learning methods require enormous training data and rich parameters tuning experience. A lightened feature learner is presented to solve these problems with application to face recognition, which shares similar topology architecture as a convolutional neural network. Our model is divided into three components: cascaded convolution filters bank learning layer, nonlinear processing layer, and feature pooling layer. Specifically, in the filters learning layer, we use K-means to learn convolution filters. Features are extracted via convoluting images with the learned filters. Afterward, in the nonlinear processing layer, hyperbolic tangent is employed to capture the nonlinear feature. In the feature pooling layer, to remove the redundancy information and incorporate the spatial layout, we exploit multilevel spatial pyramid second-order pooling technique to pool the features in subregions and concatenate them together as the final representation. Extensive experiments on four representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model to various variations, yielding competitive recognition results on extended Yale B and FERET. In addition, our method achieves the best identification performance on AR and labeled faces in the wild datasets among the comparative methods.",

And conditions to reach synchronization are more complex and difficult when chaotic systems have random parameters. So in this paper, an adaptive scheme for synchronization of chaotic system with random parameters by using the fuzzy impulsive method and combining the properties of Wiener process and Ito differential is investigated. The main concepts of this paper are applying fuzzy method to approximate the nonlinear part of system, then using Ito differential to study the Wiener process of random parameters of chaotic system, and realizing synchronization under fuzzy impulsive method. The stability is analyzed by Lyapunov stability theorem. At the end of the paper, numerical simulation is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the results obtained in this paper.",

By computing all possible coding modes, the one which has the lowest cost of rate distortion is selected as the best mode. The RDO technique improves the reliability, accuracy and error resilience of encoding while increasing the complexity and search time of the encoding. The residual value between the current and reconstructed 4\u00d74 block is calculated in the circumstances of analyzing the standard intra-prediction. If the value is smaller than a certain threshold the macro block coding can be ended in advance. Conversely, a fast 4\u00d74 intra-prediction mode selection algorithm was proposed by utilizing the correlation between the texture direction of block and the choice of predict modes. Based on the improved Canny operator and square gradient method, this algorithm extracts the texture of the current block and analyzes the corresponding relations between texture direction and the predict modes in detail. Experiments were carried out on the reference model JM13.2 of H.264/AVC. The results show that, compared with the standard algorithm, the encoding time is substantially declined in the case of keeping the bit rate and the PSNR are nearly unchanged.",

By establishing the reversible component transformation (RCT) in color space, the three-component was transformed with less relevance, and then after the lifting integer wavelet transformation, the processed components were still integers. Based on the theory of SPIHT, the proposed method set the square of defined integers as thresholds, completed the quantization and united coding of the three-component wavelet coefficients in the same time. The experiment results show that most important wavelet coefficients need less coding bits, compared with the traditional quantification, each one at least has shorten one bit.

        "abstract": "Mathematical models of GPS/GLONASS combined precise point positioning (Abbreviated as PPP) are introduced in this paper. GPS/GLONASS combined PPP models are developed based on the GPS-only PPP and numerical experiments are carried out to assess the performance of GPS/GLONASS combined PPP. The results show that: the positioning precision and convergence speed of GPS/GLONASS combined PPP are improved but not significantly compared with GPS-only PPP when the number of satellites reaches 8-9 or even more. Whereas, a few GLONASS satellites added to the combined PPP properly can improve the positioning results and convergence speed significantly when the number of satellites is less as only 4-5. Precise Point Positioning (Abbreviated as PPP) is a technique for absolute positioning. In this approach, the IGS precise orbit products and satellite clock products are adopted, all kinds of error sources are taken into account and corrected with precise models, and the un-differenced dual-frequency carrier phase observations of a standalone receiver are processed to compute the point position with high accuracy. Research on PPP is carried out widely and deeply by numerous experts in many universities and institutes home and abroad. Great achievement has been made in the aspect of algorithms, softwares, analysis of experiments results, practical applications and so on (Kouba and Heroux, 2001[2]; Gao, 2001[3]; Shirong Ye, 2002[4]; Han Baoming, 2002[4]; Zhang 2005[6]; Hu Congwei, 2005[7]). Presently, PPP is mainly based on GPS single system and it can reach the precision level of mm-cm in static positioning and cm-dm in kinematic mode. With the restoration of GLONASS system of Russia, International GLONASS-Pilot Project began to operate at the beginning of new millennium, and GLONASS is added to IGS (International GNSS Services). At present, precise ephemeris of GLONASS satellites are provided by CODE(Center of Orbit Determination, Switzerland), IAC(Information and Analytical navigation Center, Russia), BKG(Germany) and ESA/ESOC(European Space Operation Center, Germany). Simultaneously, precise satellite clock products are provided both by IAC and ESOC. Combination of multiple GNSS system has lots of advantages in many aspects such as continuity, reliability, precision and efficiency compared with any single system. GPS and GLONASS are two independent global satellite navigation positioning systems and their combination can improve the geometry significantly to assure full availability and improve the autonomous completeness and precision. Mathematical models of GPS/GLONASS combined PPP are introduced in this paper firstly, and then performance of single GPS PPP and GPS/GLONASS combined PPP are analyzed and compared with each other based on the practical cases.",

The results show that GLONASS has caused a slight impact on positioning accuracy and convergence time in case of more than 8~9 GPS satellites are tracked.

        "title": "A New Method for GNSS Multipath Mitigation with an Adaptive Frequency Domain Filter.",
        "abstract": "Multipath is the dominant error source for most fixed Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) sites and stations. The presence of multipath, particularly the multipath effect on pseudorange measurement, seriously affects positioning accuracy. Unfortunately, multipath effect reduction is still a challenging issue in high-accuracy GNSS positioning applications due to its special properties. To minimize the impact of the multipath effect, this paper focused on pseudorange multipath mitigation. First, the frequency spectrum of the code-minus-carrier divergence (CMCD) for Global Positioning System (GPS), Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) satellites observed in different environments were analyzed, where we found that periodic fluctuations appeared in GPS and GLONASS as well as medium earth orbit (MEO) and inclined geosynchronous satellite orbit (IGSO) of BDS satellites in some situations, which manifested as peaks in the frequency domain. The results showed that the location of the frequency peaks in the frequency domain, width, and basic frequency spectrum intensity were different between different satellites and environments, causing difficulty in reducing the error impact. To eliminate such period fluctuations mainly caused by the multipath effect, a novel method based on a frequency domain filter was proposed in this paper. One of the keys of the proposed method was the use of short-time Fourier transformation (STFT) in the GNSS signal data processing to calculate the accurate local frequency spectrum when code-minus-carrier divergence (CMCD) was assumed to be time varying. Once the frequency spectrum was obtained, a new spectrum peak extraction method was used to locate the peak frequency position. By interpolation and inverse Fourier transformation, the influence of the spectrum peaks could be effectively eliminated, thus improving pseudorange precision. The experimental results showed that the periodic multipath effect could be greatly reduced by the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Realtime kinematic precise point positioning (PPP) requires 1\u00a0Hz GPS satellite clock corrections. An efficient clock estimation\n approach is presented. It applies a combined dual-thread algorithm consisting of an undifferenced (UD) and epoch-differenced\n (ED) engine. The UD engine produces absolute clock values every 5\u00a0s, and the ED engine produces relative clock values between\n neighboring epochs at 1-s interval. A final 1-Hz satellite clock can be generated by combining the UD absolute clock and ED\n relative clock efficiently and accurately. Forty stations from a global tracking network are used to estimate the realtime\n 1-Hz clock with the proposed method. Both the efficiency and accuracy of the resultant clock corrections are validated. Efficiency\n test shows that the UD processing thread requires an average time of 1.88\u00a0s on a 1-GHz CPU PC for one epoch of data, while\n ED processing requires only 0.25\u00a0s. Accuracy validation test shows that the estimated 1-Hz clock agrees with IGS final clock\n accurately. The RMS values of all the available GPS satellite clock bias are less than 0.2\u00a0ns (6\u00a0cm), and most of them are\n less than 0.1\u00a0ns (3\u00a0cm). All the RMS values of Signal in Space Range Error (SISRE) are at centimeter level. Applying the accurate\n and realtime clock to realtime PPP, an accuracy of 10\u00a0cm in the horizontal and 20\u00a0cm in the vertical is achieved after a short\n period of initialization.",

        "abstract": "The main challenge of dual-frequency precise point positioning (PPP) is that it requires about 30 min to obtain centimeter-level accuracy or to succeed in the first ambiguity-fixing. Currently, PPP is generally conducted with GPS only using the ionosphere-free combination. We adopt a single-differenced (SD) between-satellite PPP model to combine the GPS and GLONASS raw dual-frequency carrier phase measurements, in which the GPS satellite with the highest elevation is selected as the reference satellite to form the SD between-satellite measurements. We use a 7-day data set from 178 IGS stations to investigate the contribution of GLONASS observations to both ambiguity-float and ambiguity-fixed SD PPP solutions, in both kinematic and static modes. In ambiguity-fixed PPP, we only attempt to fix GPS integer ambiguities, leaving GLONASS ambiguities as float values. Numerous experimental results show that PPP with GLONASS and GPS requires much less convergence time than that of PPP with GPS alone. For ambiguity-float PPP, the average convergence time can be reduced by 45.9 % from 22.9 to 12.4 min in static mode and by 57.9 % from 40.6 to 17.7 min in kinematic mode, respectively. For ambiguity-fixed PPP, the average time to the first-fixed solution can be reduced by 27.4 % from 21.6 to 15.7 min in static mode and by 42.0 % from 34.4 to 20.0 min in kinematic mode, respectively. Experimental results also show that the less the GPS satellites are used in float PPP, the more significant is the reduction in convergence time when adding GLONASS observations. In addition, on average, more than 4 GLONASS satellites can be observed for most 2-h observation sessions. Nearly, the same improvement in convergence time reduction is achieved for those observations.",

        "abstract": "For long-baseline relative positioning, the effects of ionosphere and troposphere delayed cannot be completely cancelled out by double-difference processing due to the decreasing spatial correlation as baseline separation increases. Currently there are three observation models which can be used to estimate such long baseline vector. The first one applies ionosphere-free (IF) linear combination, while the other two models named ionosphere-float model and ionosphere-weighted model directly processes original L1 and L2 carrier-phase observations. Although these three models have been used in various GNSS software, few papers about their effects on ambiguity resolution have been published. As a result, this paper will analyze the reliability of integer ambiguity resolution for these three models in terms of the ratio test and the bootstrap success rate. A new ambiguity resolution method is developed in order to improve the efficiency of ratio test. Instead of resolving the original L1 and L2 ambiguities, a transformation is designed to derive the wide-lane and L2 ambiguities, which are then sequentially resolved by the LAMBDA method. One test dataset from two National Geodetic Survey (NGS) GPS stations separated by \u223c105 km is processed by the three models. Numerical results show that the float baselines estimated by the ionosphere-free and ionosphere-float model are almost identical, and their corresponding bootstrap success rates are similar. However, the proposed sequential ambiguity resolution method can reduce the ambiguity convergence time for the ionosphere-float and ionosphere-weighted model in terms of improved ratio value of correct ambiguity fixing. Furthermore, the bootstrap success rate and the ratio values are further improved in the ionosphere-weighted model once the ionosphere noise is properly set. For the application which requires less precise accuracy and even faster convergence time, only fixing the wide-lane ambiguity and leaving others as float is able to provide 1 dm accuracy but within quite a few epochs.",

Firstly determine the segments' similarity of the coordinates time series between earthquake day and before that day or after that day, and then based on the similarity measure index to identify weight of each day for filtering. Different similarity measure indicators are analyzed. After that the universal image quality index (UIQI) method is recommended as the similarity measure for the improved sidereal filtering. It's more scientific and reasonable than other similarity measure which considers the correlation coefficient between two series, own mean value and variance as well.

        "title": "Kinematic precise orbit determination based on ambiguity-fixed PPP",
        "abstract": "With the development of space-borne GPS technologies and IGS precise orbit and clock products, precise orbit determination (POD) of Low Earth Orbiters (LEOs) based on PPP technology has become a hot issue. At present, an accuracy of 3-5 cm in Radial(R), Along-track(T), Cross-track(N) components can be achieved with conventional PPP. However, the results are less precise or reliable than the double-differenced fixed solution due to the ambiguity-float solution in traditional PPP. In order to further improve the precision and reliability of POD with PPP, daily observations from all IGS tracking stations through day 2 to 7 in 2012 were used to estimate the wide and narrow-lane fractional cycle bias (FCB) of all satellites for PPP integer ambiguity resolution. The POD of the two GRACE satellites were respectively compared with GFZ's post precise orbit and K-band measurements for the analysis of the inner and external conformities. As compared to GFZ, the daily orbital accuracy of the ambiguity-fixed solution in this work is about 2-3 cm in R direction, better than 2 cm in T direction and better than 2 cm in N direction for GRACE-A, an improvement of 19%, 30% and 50% respectively when compared with that of the float solution. The POD precision for GRACE-B are 2-3 cm, 2 cm and 1-2 cm in R, N, T directions for the fixed solution, respectively. The accuracy improvement in the fixed solution for GARCE-B is nearly equivalent with that for GRACE-A. For K-band cases, the mean STD error of KBR residual is a-bout 16.4 mm for the fixed solution, and 22.6 mm for the float solution. These results show that PPP with ambiguity-fixed can greatly improve POD precision of LEO satellites and provide more reliable orbital service.",

P1/CA augmentation information can shorten the convergence time and help to fix the ionosphere-free combination ambiguities in several epochs. Instantaneous and centimeter-level positioning solutions can be achieved for rovers within the coverage of regional reference network. Also, we develop an approach for seamless transition between URTK and precise point positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR) and present a new scheme to provide URTK service. Therefore, a service for a large number of rovers can be easily realized in real-time data communication for ambiguity fixing. In addition, the period when augmentation information from a particular reference station is not available can be bridged with the help of PPP-AR. Rovers can experience more operational time with fewer interruptions, which are difficult tasks for current URTK and Network Real-Time Kinematic services. More importantly, with this new scheme, URTK and PPP-AR services can be integrated into a unique PPP-AR system. The obtained convergence time only depends on whether or not the rover is receiving the regional augmentation information.",

        "abstract": "Over the past decades, a number of methods have been proposed to handle cycle slips in the carrier phase measurements, but few researches have investigated receiver clock jumps, which may produce undesirable effects on GPS data processing. Such events are generally ignored in double-differenced positioning. For undifferenced processing, such as precise point positioning (PPP) techniques, it is unwise to neglect the impact of clock jumps. Failure to properly detect and account for receiver clock jumps may sometimes cause unexpected behavior of the GPS software and large errors in the resulting PPP solution. This is particularly troublesome when there are irregular (types 2 or 3) millisecond clock jumps represented in RINEX observation files. In this study, we first provide an intuitive description of the receiver clock jump phenomenon, and a comprehensive classification of clock jumps is presented according to its influence on three fundamental quantities (time tag, pseudorange, and carrier phase) of RINEX observation files. To follow the RINEX convention, the observable consistency is analyzed for various types of clock jump; and a simple but robust real-time clock jump compensation (RTCJC) method is proposed for reconstructing a consistent set of observables. Numerous validation tests with various GPS data show that the method is applicable to millisecond clock jumps. Without RTCJC, clock jumps are prone to cause failure of gross error and cycle slip detection algorithms and so result in repeated re-initialization or even non-convergent solutions, which lead to gross errors in the PPP solution. When RTCJC is applied, all clock jumps present in the GPS data can be effectively identified and repaired accurately, and the problem of re-initialization in PPP will no longer be triggered by receiver clock jumps, which results in significant improvement of PPP accuracy and reliability.",

The method couples the kinematic PPP and static PPP, where the continuous kinematic observations between two sequential short static observations provide a correction for the carrier phase ambiguities. Therefore, the whole consecutive observations, including both static and kinematic segments, will contribute to the ambiguities convergence of each point with few epochs' static observation. The experimental results showed that for the measured points which are observed over 60 s with 5 s sampling rate in static mode, the positioning accuracy can reach 5-6 cm in the horizontal and 0\u00b71 m in the vertical; for those points which are observed over 10 s with 5 s sampling rate in static mode, the positioning accuracy is about 8-9 cm in horizontal and 0\u00b712 m in vertical.",

        "abstract": "Airborne LiDAR is an advanced remote sensing technique, which can collect the 3D spatial information of objects directly and effectively, and it has been widely used in acquiring precision digital terrain model (DTM). Nevertheless, in forest areas with a dense vegetation and steep slopes, the amount of laser footprints that can penetrate through the vegetation and reach the ground is relatively less than that in an open area, so the DTM acquisition is difficult to some extent in forest areas. The paper proposes an inherited multi-resolution voxel-based filtering algorithm, aiming at deriving the digital terrain model in forest areas. The laser scanning data were divided into voxels with different resolutions by comparing the weighted average height with neighbors. Vegetation in voxels was rejected and terrain points were retained to be interpolated into the DTM. This study suggests that the filtering algorithm is effective in DTM acquisition of forest areas.",

Using the TEC data from 2008 to 2012 provided by the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) as sample data, the precision of this method in the prediction of ionosphere TEC value was analysed which varies from high latitude to low latitude in both quiet and active period. The effect of TEC sample's length on the predicted accuracy is analyzed, too. Results from numerical experiments show that in ionospheric quiet period the average relative prediction accuracy of 6 days are up to 83.3% with an average prediction residual errors of about 0.18\ufffd\ufffd1.9TECu, while it changes to 86.6% with an average prediction residual errors of about 0.69\ufffd\ufffd2.6TECu in ionospheric active period. For the former, above 90% of predicted residual is less than \ufffd\ufffd3TECu while the latter is only about 81%. Two periods show the same law that the higher the latitude, the higher the absolute precision, and the lower the predicted relative accuracy. In addition, the prediction accuracy will improve with the increase of TEC sample sequences length, but it will gradually reduce if the length exceed the optimal length about 40 days. On the other hand, with the same TEC sample, the predicted days increase, the predicted accuracy decreases. Though it's not obvious in the beginning, it will be significantly reduced over 30 days.",

The method is especially designed for environmental surveys, such as beach mapping or glacier surveys. The proposed method, termed stepwise geometric misalignment determination is based on the relationship between the point clouds on a regular object, e.g. a flat top building, and the ground truth of the objects used for calibration. In order to extract the footprints on the objects, filtering is implemented before the calibration. The tests verify that the proposed method is feasible, and very effective. The calibration flight should be designed beforehand to ensure the accuracy of the retrieved boresight corrections.

Two different approaches are used to realize the transformation between ITRF2005 and CGCS2000. One is the transformation with considering the epoch and the frame together and the other is with considering the two aspects respectively. The practical results show that the former can not satisfy the accuracy required. As for the later, the motion rate of the points unknown can be interpolated first by using a weight-average method according to the available information of points known, and then adopt the 7 parameters to transform the different frames. This method can meet the needs of transformation accuracy which can achieve 1-2 cm.",

In our study, we demonstrate the performance of the real-time ambiguity-fixed precise point positioning (PPP) approach using 5 Hz GPS data collected during El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake (Mw 7.2, 4 April 2010). The PPP-based displacements show to agree with accelerometerbased displacement at centimeter level. The key for successfully obtaining high precision displacements is the efficient ambiguity resolution. PPP with ambiguity fixing can result in correct permanent co-seismic offsets and correct recovery of moment magnitude and fault slip inversion at levels comparable to post-processing. \u00a9 2013.

In this contribution,\n we present a new strategy to augment PPP estimation with a regional reference network, so that instantaneous ambiguity fixing\n is achievable for users within the network coverage. In the proposed method, precise zero-differenced atmospheric delays are\n derived from the PPP fixed solution of the reference stations, which are disseminated to, and interpolated at user stations\n to correct for L1, L2 phase observations or their combinations. With the corrected observations, instantaneous ambiguity resolution\n can be carried out within the user PPP software, thus achieving the position solutions equivalent to the network real-time\n kinematic positioning (NRTK). The strategy is validated experimentally. The derived atmospheric delays and the interpolated\n corrections are investigated. The ambiguity fixing performance and the resulted position accuracy are assessed. The validation\n confirms that the new strategy can provide comparable service with NRTK. Therefore, with this new processing strategy, it\n is possible to integrate PPP and NRTK into a seamless positioning service, which can provide an accuracy of about 10\u00a0cm anywhere,\n and upgrade to a few centimeters within a regional network.",

The segmentation of tree crown was implemented in several phases. First, the relatively high vegetation points were filtered out from the original tree dimensional point cloud by lidar data processing software. These vegetation points were interpolated in a grid, and then lowpass filter and highpass filter method were utilized to smooth the noise and sharp the crown edge respectively. In the next phase, the points were transformed to be a grayscale image, and the contrast of the image was enhanced by a contrast stretch algorithm to help the segmentation in latter step. Before the watershed segmentation was used to segment the tree crowns, the opening and closing operation in morphology were operated on the image to optimize the segmentation. Finally, a satisfying segmentation result was shown compared to the result which the contrast stretch algorithm wasn't operated on the image, even the overlapped tree crowns were segmented successfully in our test.",

        "abstract": "GPS precise orbit determination antenna observations from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites represent a new plasmaspheric data source, which are globally distributed and continuously available. By assuming that all free electrons in the plasmasphere at an altitude range of approximately 800-20 200 km are contained in a thin shell (namely, a single-layer model), daily global plasmaspheric maps (GPMs) of plasmaspheric electron content (PEC) are constructed using a spherical harmonic expansion. We employ this method to obtain PEC maps for DOY 102-131 in 2008 and compare the PEC model values with the Meteorological Operational satellite programme (MetOp) measurements. According to the estimation results, the global PEC values show features that are consistent with previous studies and exhibit higher estimation accuracy; the estimation results of COSMIC GPS receiver differential code biases also agree well with the reference values in the 30 days. During this period, the mean rms of the differences between MetOp PEC measurements and GPM PEC values is 1.29 TECU, which suggests that GPMs can offer reasonable and high-precision PEC values.",

IAR for PPP became a highlight topic in global positioning system (GPS) community in recent years. More and more researchers focus on this issue. Progress has been made in the latest years. In this paper, we aim at investigating and demonstrating the performance of a global zero-differenced (ZD) PPP IAR service for GPS users by providing routine ZD uncalibrated fractional offsets (UFOs) for wide-lane and narrow-lane. Data sets from all IGS stations collected on DOY 1, 100, 200 and 300 of 2010 are used to validate and demonstrate this global service. Static experiment results show that an accuracy better than 1 cm in horizontal and 1-2 cm in vertical could be achieved in ambiguity-fixed PPP solution with only hourly data. Compared with PPP float solution, an average improvement reaches 58.2% in east, 28.3% in north and 23.8% in vertical for all tested stations. Results of kinematic experiments show that the RMS of kinematic PPP solutions can be improved from 21.6, 16.6 and 37.7 mm to 12.2, 13.3 and 34.3 mm for the fixed solutions in the east, north and vertical components, respectively. Both static and kinematic experiments show that wide-lane and narrow-lane UFO products of all satellites can be generated and provided in a routine way accompanying satellite orbit and clock products for the PPP user anywhere around the world, to obtain accurate and reliable ambiguity-fixed PPP solutions. \u00a9 2012 COSPAR.

        "abstract": "Ionospheric disturbances can be detrimental to accuracy and reliability of GNSS positioning. We focus on how ionospheric scintillation induces significant degradation to Precise Point Positioning (PPP) and how to improve the performance of PPP during ionospheric scintillation periods. We briefly describe these problems and give the physical explanation of highly correlated phenomenon of degraded PPP estimates and occurrence of ionospheric scintillation. Three possible reasons can contribute to significant accuracy degradation in the presence of ionospheric scintillation: (a) unexpected loss of lock of tracked satellites which greatly reduces the available observations and considerably weakens the geometry, (b) abnormal blunders which are not properly mitigated by positioning programs, and (c) failure of cycle slip detection algorithms due to the high rate of total electronic content. The latter two reasons are confirmed as the major causes of sudden accuracy degradation by means of a comparative analysis. To reduce their adverse effect on positioning, an improved approach based on a robust iterative Kalman filter is adopted to enhance the PPP performance. Before the data enter the filter, the differential code biases are used for GNSS data quality checking. Any satellite whose C1---P1 and P1---P2 biases exceed 10 and 30 m, respectively, will be rejected. Both the Melbourne---Wubbena and geometry-free combination are used for cycle slip detection. But the thresholds are set more flexibly when ionospheric conditions become unusual. With these steps, most of the outliers and cycle slips can be effectively detected, and a first PPP estimation can be carried out. Furthermore, an iterative PPP estimator is utilized to mitigate the remaining gross errors and cycle slips which will be reflected in the posterior residuals. Further validation tests based on extensive experiments confirm our physical explanation and the new approach. The results show that the improved approach effectively avoids a large number of ambiguity resets which would otherwise be necessary. It reduces the number of re-parameterized phase ambiguities by approximately half, without scarifying the accuracy and reliability of the PPP solution.",

        "abstract": "In order to overcome the shortcomings (e.g. to amplify measurement noise, loss of half observations) of traditional ionosphere-free PPP model, recently some researchers have proposed a new PPP model by using uncombined original non-differenced carrier phase and pseudorange observations to implement PPP, which named uncombined PPP. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of both PPP models are analyzed in detail. Observations from 10 IGS tracking stations on October 10th in 2011 are used to demonstrate the static and simulated kinematic PPP positioning performance with respect to positioning accuracy, convergence time and ZPD estimation accuracy between two PPP models. The results show that for both combined and uncombined PPP model, daily static positioning accuracy of mm~cm in horizontal, 1~3 cm in vertical and a kinematic positioning accuracy of 1~3 cm in horizontal, about 4 cm in vertical can be achieved. Observation residuals in uncombined PPP model are smaller than that of combined PPP model. For static case, the average convergence time of uncombined PPP is 38 min which is longer than that of combined PPP, For kinematic case, the average convergence time of uncombined PPP is 33min longer than that of combined PPP. For ZPD estimation, an accuracy level of about 6mm can be achieved from both PPP models.",

ArcGIS version 9.0, has been used as the implementation platform as which as effective data processing function and outstanding performance of data analysis such as TIN interpolation and 3D display. To extract trees from the raw data, the data is loaded into ArcGIS to create shapefile recognized by ArcGIS at first, and the corresponding attributes, coordinates, intensity and height difference computed by programming are stored. Then we select the data accord with the filtering condition, a threshold for height difference is given. All the comparisons of 3D coordinates and intensity occur between point data in the same row, in other words, between the first pulse and last pulse. We accept the first pulse which satisfies the height difference threshold as vegetation points. At last, a considerable result of detection of trees has been achieved.",

The principles of SRTI method and modified SRTI method are presented and detectable period range is analyzed theoretically for both methods. Then we analyze MSTIDs using observation data of 5 IGS stations in southern California on day 189, 2012. The results show that there are two disturbance waves with the period 15 min and 39 min, respectively at 21:30-23:00 LT. The SRTI method detected only the former, while the modified SRTI method propped both of them, which means it has good sensitivity to both short-period disturbances and long-period disturbances. With the disturbance sequence acquired by the modified SRTI method, the MSTIDs propagation parameters are estimated using the FFT phase difference method. The results are consistent with the previous studies totally. This indicates that the modified SRTI method can be fully applied to the study of MSTIDs and has advantage in processing mass data with a simple calculation procedure.",

In the method, the velocity of GPS station is precisely estimated based on the Doppler shift method by only using standard GPS broadcast products and high-rate carrier phase measurements, which are available in real time. We analyzed the 5 Hz GPS data collected by UNAVCO-Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) network from five stations in near-field areas within 50~100 km from the epicenter during the Mw7.2 EI-Mayor-Cucapah earthquake occurred on 4 April 2010 in Baja California (32.259\u00b0N, 115.287\u00b0W), and compared the results with strong-motion seismograph records. The GPS results find a good agreement with the integrated strong motion seismograph record, and the earthquake waveforms can be fully recovered. Exciting performance demonstrates the potential application of this method.",

At the moment more than 70 satellites are already in view, and about 120 satellites will be available once all four systems (BeiDou + Galileo + GLONASS + GPS) are fully deployed in the next few years. This will bring great opportunities and challenges for both scientific and engineering applications. In this paper we develop a four-system positioning model to make full use of all available observations from different GNSSs.

        "title": "Assessment of correct fixing rate for precise point positioning ambiguity resolution on a global scale",
        "abstract": "Ambiguity resolution (AR) for a single receiver has been a popular topic in Global Positioning System (GPS) recently. Ambiguity-resolution methods for precise point positioning (PPP) have been well documented in recent years, demonstrating that it can improve the accuracy of PPP. However, users are often concerned about the reliability of ambiguity-fixed PPP solution in practical applications. If ambiguities are fixed to wrong integers, large errors would be introduced into position estimates. In this paper, we aim to assess the correct fixing rate (CFR), i.e., number of ambiguities correctly fixing to the total number of ambiguities correctly and incorrectly fixing, for PPP user ambiguity resolution on a global scale. A practical procedure is presented to evaluate the CFR of PPP user ambiguity resolution. GPS data of the first 3 days in each month of 2010 from about 390 IGS stations are used for experiments. Firstly, we use GPS data collected from about 320 IGS stations to estimate global single-differenced (SD) wide-lane and narrow-lane satellite uncalibrated phase delays (UPDs). The quality of UPDs is evaluated. We found that wide-lane UPD estimates have a rather small standard deviation (Std) between 0.003 and 0.004 cycles while most of Std of narrow-lane estimates are from 0.01 to 0.02 cycles. Secondly, many experiments have been conducted to investigate the CFR of integer ambiguity resolution we can achieve under different conditions, including reference station density, observation session length and the ionospheric activity. The results show that the CFR of PPP can exceed 98.0 % with only 1 h of observations for most user stations. No obvious correlation between the CFR and the reference station density is found. Therefore, nearly homogeneous CFR can be achieved in PPP AR for global users. At user end, higher CFR could be achieved with longer observations. The average CFR for 30-min, 1-h, 2-h and 4-h observation is 92.3, 98.2, 99.5 and 99.7 %, respectively. In order to get acceptable CFR, 1 h is a recommended minimum observation time. Furthermore, the CFR of PPP can be affected by diurnal variation and geomagnetic latitude variation in the ionosphere. During one day at the hours when rapid ionospheric variations occur or in low geomagnetic latitude regions where equatorial electron density irregularities are produced relatively frequently, a significant degradation of the CFR is demonstrated. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "Since the Selective Availability was turned off, the velocity and acceleration can be determined accurately with a single GPS receiver using raw Doppler measurements. The carrier-phase-derived Doppler measurements are normally used to determine velocity and acceleration when there is no direct output of the raw Doppler observations in GPS receivers. Due to GPS receiver clock drifts, however, a GPS receiver clock jump occurs when the GPS receiver clock resets itself (typically with 1 ms increment/decrement) to synchronize with the GPS time. The clock jump affects the corresponding relationship between measurements and their time tags, which results in non-equidistant measurement sampling in time or incorrect time tags. This in turn affects velocity and acceleration determined for a GPS receiver by the conventional method which needs equidistant carrier phases to construct the derived Doppler measurements. To overcome this problem, an improved method that takes into account, GPS receiver clock jumps are devised to generate non-equidistant-derived Doppler observations based on non-equidistant carrier phases. Test results for static and kinematic receivers, which are obtained by using the conventional method without reconstructing the equidistant continuous carrier phases, show that receiver velocity and acceleration suffered significantly from clock jumps. An airborne kinematic experiment shows that the greatest impact on velocity and acceleration reaches up to 0.2 m/s, 0.1 m/s2 for the horizontal component and 0.5 m/s, 0.25 m/s2 for the vertical component. Therefore, it can be demonstrated that velocity and acceleration measurements by using a standalone GPS receiver can be immune to the influence of GPS receiver clock jumps with the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Long-range airborne laser altimetry and laser scanning (LIDAR) or airborne gravity surveys in, for example, polar or oceanic\n areas require airborne kinematic GPS baselines of many hundreds of kilometers in length. In such instances, with the complications\n of ionospheric biases, it can be a real challenge for traditional differential kinematic GPS software to obtain reasonable\n solutions. In this paper, we will describe attempts to validate an implementation of the precise point positioning (PPP) technique\n on an aircraft without the use of a local GPS reference station. We will compare PPP solutions with other conventional GPS\n solutions, as well as with independent data by comparison of airborne laser data with \u201cground truth\u201d heights. The comparisons\n involve two flights: A July 5, 2003, airborne laser flight line across the North Atlantic from Iceland to Scotland, and a\n May 24, 2004, flight in an area of the Arctic Ocean north of Greenland, near-coincident in time and space with the ICESat\n satellite laser altimeter. Both of these flights were more than 800\u00a0km long. Comparisons between different GPS methods and\n four different software packages do not suggest a clear preference for any one, with the heights generally showing decimeter-level\n agreement. For the comparison with the independent ICESat- and LIDAR-derived \u201cground truth\u201d of ocean or sea-ice heights, the\n statistics of comparison show a typical fit of around 10\u00a0cm RMS in the North Atlantic, and 30\u00a0cm in the sea-ice region north\n of Greenland. Part of the latter 30\u00a0cm error is likely due to errors in the airborne LIDAR measurement and calibration, as\n well as errors in the \u201cground truth\u201d ocean surfaces due to drifting sea-ice. Nevertheless, the potential of the PPP method\n for generating 10\u00a0cm level kinematic height positioning over long baselines is illustrated.",

Finally, the result shows that the kinematic time delay can be neglected as compared with other error sources.\n The accuracy of the coordinates is not only influenced by the amplitude of the error, but also controlled by the operation\n parameters such as flight height, scanning angle amplitude and attitude magnitude of the platform.",

However, the\n precise point positioning (PPP) technique can also achieve centimeter to decimeter kinematic positioning accuracy without\n restriction of inter-station distances but is not as popular as network RTK for real-time engineering applications. Typically,\n PPP requires a long initialization time and continuous satellite signals to maintain the high accuracy. In case of phase breaks\n or loss of signals, re-initialization is usually required. An approach of instantaneous cycle slips fixing using undifferenced\n carrier phase measurements is proposed, which leads to instantaneous re-initialization for real-time PPP. In the proposed\n approach, various errors such as real-time orbit and clock errors, atmosphere delay and wind-up effects are first refined\n and isolated from integer cycle slips. The integer values of cycle slips can then be estimated and fixed with the LAMBDA technique\n by applying a cascade cycle slip resolution strategy. Numerical experiments with different user dynamics are carried out to\n allow a comprehensive evaluation of efficiency and robustness of the cycle slip fixing algorithm. The results show that the\n cycle slips can be fixed correctly in all cases considered and that data gaps of up to 300\u00a0s can be connected with high confidence.\n As a result, instantaneous re-initialization is achieved in the real-time PPP processing.",

As it's the same with GPS satellites it's very important to estimate the differential code basis of Compass satellites. But with few Compass satellites in orbit at the present time and the characteristics of Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) Satellites, it's difficult to separate the ionosphere parameters from the differential code basis. A method to estimate the DCB of Compass satellites is put forward in this article with the mathematical models.

We investigate the applicability and interpolation effect of spatial regression model in which precise ZPD derived from regional CORS network are used to interpolate ZPD for user site. We also demonstrate that H1QM3 model and MLCM model are equivalent, and propose the height constraint strategy to improve interpolation precision. It is shown that the H1QX1 model and H1QM3 model are superior to other models, interpolation precision is 10 mm in the flat region and 20mm in the undulated region. With height constraint, the precision of intepolated ZPD can be improved by 60% in the undulated region. The optimal number of reference stations for intepolation is 9 or 10.",

During the 2003/04 austral summer season,five day's GPS measurement was carried out on the front of the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS),East Antarctica,by the 20th Chinese National Antarctica Research Expedition. The GPS data was processed using GAMIT/GLOBK software with 2-hour static data segment and the vertical precision is less than 0.18 m. To verify the results for the vertical component,the ice shelf GPS tidal signal was compared with the tidal result derived from tide gauge measurements at Zhongshan Station. Comparison of the GPS results with the tide gauge gives a good agreement in amplitude at the few cm level,which indicates that the tide under the front of Amery Ice Shelf is irregular semidiurnal tide,the maximal tidal differences is approximately 2 m. GPS data can be used to validate the ocean tide model around the Antarctic area and such studies are important to improve the knowledge about the Antarctic ice shelf mass balance and dynamical models of ice sheet/ocean interaction.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposed a new method for detection of pre-earthquake ionospheric anomalies using time series analysis based on the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Firstly, we compared the precision of this new method with the traditional ones, namely the Inter Quartile Range (IQR) method and the sliding window method, in predicting the TEC reference background values. The results show that the precision of the former is obviously better than the latter, while the average prediction residual errors of the former are twice smaller than the latter. To detect pre-earthquake ionospheric anomalies more accurately, besides precise reference background value, its reasonable error range is also needed. Therefore, this paper put forward a new method to calculate the reference background value's upper and lower bounds. Finally, the earthquake happened in Sumatra on January 10, 2012 was taken as example. We analyzed its pre-earthquake ionospheric anomalies and proved the effectiveness of the new method. The results show that obvious ionospheric anomalies appeared on the 13th, 8th to 9th and 1st to 2nd days before the earthquake as well as several hours during the day when the earthquake happened. Furthermore, positive anomalies (observational values higher than normal ones) generally appeared to the north of the epicenter and are much earlier before the earthquake occurrence, while the negative ones (observation values lower than the normal) occurred in any direction to the epicenter, and close to the moment the earthquake occurrence. Through statistics for the frequency of ionospheric anomalies occurred at different times of the day, we have also found a valuable law that the closer the time of the day before the earthquake moment, the higher the occurrence frequency of the ionospheric anomalies, which is likely to be an important reference to the more accurate earthquake prediction in the future.",

        "abstract": "Both static and kinematic testings are investigated by using IGS 5min, 30s and 5s-interval precise satellite clock products in precise point positioning (PPP) solution. Test results show that the sampling rate of IGS satellite clock has very little effect on the static PPP solution. All the three types of sampling intervals of precise satellite clock can satisfy mm-cm level of positioning accuracy; higher sampling rate has no significant improvement for PPP solution. However, sampling rate of satellite clock has a significant impact on the PPP solution in kinematic PPP. The higher the interval of satellite clock, the better the accuracy achieved. The accuracy of kinematic PPP achieved by using 30s-interval precise satellite clock is improved by nearly 30-50 percent with respect to the solution by using 5min-interval precise satellite clock, but using 5s and 30s-interval satellite clock can almost produce the same accuracy of kinematic solution. Moreover, the use of precise satellite clock products from different analysis centers may also produce more or less effect on the PPP solution.",

        "abstract": "This article first clearly figures out the relationship between parameters of timing group delay (TGD) and differential code bias (DCB) for BDS, and demonstrates the equivalence of TGD and DCB correction models combining theory with practice. The TGD/DCB correction models have been extended to various occasions for BDS positioning, and such models have been evaluated by real triple-frequency datasets. To test the effectiveness of broadcast TGDs in the navigation message and DCBs provided by the Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX), both standard point positioning (SPP) and precise point positioning (PPP) tests are carried out for BDS signals with different schemes. Furthermore, the influence of differential code biases on BDS positioning estimates such as coordinates, receiver clock biases, tropospheric delays and carrier phase ambiguities is investigated comprehensively. Comparative analysis show that the unmodeled differential code biases degrade the performance of BDS SPP by a factor of two or more, whereas the estimates of PPP are subject to varying degrees of influences. For SPP, the accuracy of dual-frequency combinations is slightly worse than that of single-frequency, and they are much more sensitive to the differential code biases, particularly for the B2B3 combination. For PPP, the uncorrected differential code biases are mostly absorbed into the receiver clock bias and carrier phase ambiguities and thus resulting in a much longer convergence time. Even though the influence of the differential code biases could be mitigated over time and comparable positioning accuracy could be achieved after convergence, it is suggested to properly handle with the differential code biases since it is vital for PPP convergence and integer ambiguity resolution.",

        "abstract": "With the development of precise point positioning (PPP), the School of Geodesy and Geomatics (SGG) at Wuhan University is now routinely producing GPS satellite fractional cycle bias (FCB) products with open access for worldwide PPP users to conduct ambiguity-fixed PPP solution. We provide a brief theoretical background of PPP and present the strategies and models to compute the FCB products. The practical realization of the two-step (wide-lane and narrow-lane) FCB estimation scheme is described in detail. With GPS measurements taken in various situations, i.e., static, dynamic, and on low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the quality of FCB estimation and the effectiveness of PPP ambiguity resolution (AR) are evaluated. The comparison with CNES FCBs indicated that our FCBs had a good consistency with the CNES ones. For wide-lane FCB, almost all the differences of the two products were within \u00b10.05 cycles. For narrow-lane FCB, 87.8 % of the differences were located between \u00b10.05 cycles, and 97.4 % of them were located between \u00b10.075 cycles. The experimental results showed that, compared with conventional ambiguity-float PPP, the averaged position RMS of static PPP can be improved from (3.6, 1.4, 3.6) to (2.0, 1.0, 2.7) centimeters for ambiguity-fixed PPP. The average accuracy improvement in the east, north, and up components reached 44.4, 28.6, and 25.0 %, respectively. A kinematic, ambiguity-fixed PPP test with observation of 80 min achieved a position accuracy of better than 5 cm at the one-sigma level in all three coordinate components. Compared with the results of ambiguity-float, kinematic PPP, the positioning biases of ambiguity-fixed PPP were improved by about 78.2, 20.8, and 65.1 % in east, north, and up. The RMS of LEO PPP test was improved by about 23.0, 37.0, and 43.0 % for GRACE-A and GRACE-B in radial, tangential, and normal directions when AR was applied to the same data set. These results demonstrated that the SGG FCB products can be produced with high quality for users anywhere around the world to carry out ambiguity-fixed PPP solutions.",

        "abstract": "The latest generation of GPS satellites, termed Block IIF, provides a new L5 signal. Multi-frequency signals open new prospects for precise positioning and fast ambiguity resolution and have become the trend in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) development. However, a new type of inter-frequency clock bias (IFCB), i.e., the difference between the current clock products computed with L1/L2 and the satellite clocks computed with L1/L5, was noticed. Consequently, the L1/L2 clock products cannot be used for L1/L5 precise point positioning (PPP). In order to solve this issue, the IFCB should be estimated with a high accuracy. Datasets collected at 129 globally distributed Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) stations from 2015 are employed to investigate the IFCB. The results indicate that the IFCB is satellite dependent and varies with the relative sun---spacecraft---earth geometry. Other factors, however, may also contribute to the IFCB variations according to the harmonic analysis of the single-day IFCB time series. In addition, the results show that the IFCB exhibits periodic signal with a notable period of 43,080 s and the peak-to-peak amplitude is 0.023---0.269 m. After considering a time lag of 240 s, the average cross-correlation coefficient between the IFCB series of two consecutive days is 0.943, and the prediction accuracy of IFCB is 0.006 m. A triple-frequency PPP model that takes the IFCB into account is proposed. When using 3-h datasets, the positioning accuracy of triple-frequency PPP can be improved by 19, 13 and 21 % compared with the L1/L2-based PPP in the east, north and up directions, respectively.",

First, three triple-frequency PPP models are developed. The observation model and stochastic model are designed and extended to accommodate the third frequency.

Results show that the three triple-frequency PPP models agree well with each other. Additional frequency has a marginal effect on the positioning accuracy in static PPP tests.

        "abstract": "All BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS) satellites are transmitting signals on three frequencies, which brings new opportunity and challenges for high-accuracy precise point positioning (PPP) with ambiguity resolution (AR). This paper proposes an effective uncalibrated phase delay (UPD) estimation and AR strategy which is based on a raw PPP model. First, triple-frequency raw PPP models are developed. The observation model and stochastic model are designed and extended to accommodate the third frequency. Then, the UPD is parameterized in raw frequency form while estimating with the high-precision and low-noise integer linear combination of float ambiguity which are derived by ambiguity decorrelation. Third, with UPD corrected, the LAMBDA method is used for resolving full or partial ambiguities which can be fixed. This method can be easily and flexibly extended for dual-, triple- or even more frequency. To verify the effectiveness and performance of triple-frequency PPP AR, tests with real BDS data from 90 stations lasting for 21 days were performed in static mode. Data were processed with three strategies: BDS triple-frequency ambiguity-float PPP, BDS triple-frequency PPP with dual-frequency (B1/B2) and three-frequency AR, respectively. Numerous experiment results showed that compared with the ambiguity-float solution, the performance in terms of convergence time and positioning biases can be significantly improved by AR. Among three groups of solutions, the triple-frequency PPP AR achieved the best performance. Compared with dual-frequency AR, additional the third frequency could apparently improve the position estimations during the initialization phase and under constraint environments when the dual-frequency PPP AR is limited by few satellite numbers.",

        "abstract": "The time-varying biases within carrier phase observations will be integrated with satellite clock offset parameters in the precise clock estimation. The inconsistency among signal-dependent phase biases within a satellite results in the inadequacy of the current L1/L2 ionospheric-free (IF) satellite clock products for the GPS precise point positioning (PPP) involving L5 signal. The inter-frequency clock bias (IFCB) estimation approaches for triple-frequency PPP based on either uncombined (UC) observations or IF combined observations within a single arbitrary combination are proposed in this study. The key feature of the IFCB estimation approaches is that we only need to obtain a set of phase-specific IFCB (PIFCB) estimates between the L1/L5 and L1/L2 IF satellite clocks, and then, we can directly convert the obtained L1/L5 IF PIFCBs into L5 UC PIFCBs and L1/L2/L5 IF PIFCBs by multiplying individual constants. The mathematical conversion formula is rigorously derived. The UC and IF triple-frequency PPP models are developed. Datasets from 171 stations with a globally even distribution on seven consecutive days were adopted for analysis. After 24-h observation, the UC and IF triple-frequency PPP without PIFCB corrections can achieve an accuracy of 8, 6 and 13\u00a0mm, and 8, 5 and 13\u00a0mm in east, north and up coordinate components, respectively, while the corresponding positioning accuracy of the cases with PIFCB consideration can be improved by 38, 33 and 31%, and 50, 40 and 23% to 5, 4 and 9\u00a0mm, and 4, 3 and 10\u00a0mm in the three components, respectively. The corresponding improvement in convergence time is 17, 1 and 22% in the three components in UC model, respectively. Moreover, the phase observation residuals on L5 frequency in UC triple-frequency PPP and of L1/L2/L5 IF combination in IF triple-frequency PPP are reduced by about 4\u00a0mm after applying PIFCB corrections. The performance improvement in UC triple-frequency PPP over UC dual-frequency PPP is 7, 4 and 2% in terms of convergence time in the three components, respectively. The daily solutions of UC triple-frequency PPP have a comparable positioning accuracy to the UC dual-frequency PPP.\n",

        "title": "The contribution of Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) to precise point positioning",
        "abstract": "Abstract   In response to the changing world of GNSS, the International GNSS Service (IGS) has initiated the Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX). As part of the MGEX project, initial precise orbit and clock products have been released for public use, which are the key prerequisites for multi-GNSS precise point positioning (PPP). In particular, precise orbits and clocks at intervals of 5\u00a0min and 30\u00a0s are presently available for the new emerging systems. This paper investigates the benefits of multi-GNSS for PPP. Firstly, orbit and clock consistency tests (between different providers) were performed for GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou. In general, the differences of GPS are, respectively, 1.0\u20131.5\u00a0cm for orbit and 0.1\u00a0ns for clock. The consistency of GLONASS is worse than GPS by a factor of 2\u20133, i.e. 2\u20134\u00a0cm for orbit and 0.2\u00a0ns for clock. However, the corresponding differences of Galileo and BeiDou are significantly larger than those of GPS and GLONASS, particularly for the BeiDou GEO satellites. Galileo as well as BeiDou IGSO/MEO products have a consistency of 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0m for orbit, and 0.2\u20130.3\u00a0ns for clock. As to BeiDou GEO satellites, the difference of their orbits reaches 3\u20134\u00a0m in along-track, 0.5\u20130.6\u00a0m in cross-track, and 0.2\u20130.3\u00a0m in the radial directions, together with an average RMS of 0.6\u00a0ns for clock. Furthermore, the short-term stability of multi-GNSS clocks was analyzed by Allan deviation. Results show that clock stability of the onboard GNSS is highly dependent on the satellites generations, operational lifetime, orbit types, and frequency standards. Finally, kinematic PPP tests were conducted to investigate the contribution of multi-GNSS and higher rate clock corrections. As expected, the positioning accuracy as well as convergence speed benefit from the fusion of multi-GNSS and higher rate of precise clock corrections. The multi-GNSS PPP improves the positioning accuracy by 10\u201320%, 40\u201360%, and 60\u201380% relative to the GPS-, GLONASS-, and BeiDou-only PPP. The usage of 30\u00a0s interval clock products decreases interpolation errors, and the positioning accuracy is improved by an average of 30\u201350% for the all the cases except for the BeiDou-only PPP.",

        "abstract": "The joint use of multi-frequency signals brings new prospects for precise positioning and has become a trend in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) development. However, a new type of inter-frequency clock bias (IFCB), namely the difference between satellite clocks computed with different ionospheric-free carrier phase combinations, was noticed. Consequently, the B1/B3 precise point positioning (PPP) cannot directly use the current B1/B2 clock products. Datasets from 35 globally distributed stations are employed to investigate the IFCB. For new generation BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) satellites, namely BDS-3 satellites, the IFCB between B1/B2a and B1/B3 satellite clocks, between B1/B2b and B1/B3 satellite clocks, between B1C/B2a and B1C/B3 satellite clocks, and between B1C/B2b and B1C/B3 satellite clocks is analyzed, and no significant IFCB variations can be observed. The IFCB between B1/B2 and B1/B3 satellite clocks for BDS-2 satellites varies with time, and the IFCB variations are generally confined to peak amplitudes of about 5 cm. The IFCB of BDS-2 satellites exhibits periodic signal, and the accuracy of prediction for IFCB, namely the root mean square (RMS) statistic of the difference between predicted and estimated IFCB values, is 1.2 cm. A triple-frequency PPP model with consideration of IFCB is developed. Compared with B1/B2-based PPP, the positioning accuracy of triple-frequency PPP with BDS-2 satellites can be improved by 12%, 25% and 10% in east, north and vertical directions, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Reliable and rapid ambiguity resolution (AR) is the key to fast precise point positioning (PPP). We propose a modified partial ambiguity resolution (PAR) method, in which an elevation and standard deviation criterion are first used to remove the low-precision ambiguity estimates for AR. Subsequently the success rate and ratio-test are simultaneously used in an iterative process to increase the possibility of finding a subset of decorrelated ambiguities which can be fixed with high confidence. One can apply the proposed PAR method to try to achieve an ambiguity-fixed solution when full ambiguity resolution (FAR) fails. We validate this method using data from 450 stations during DOY 021 to 027, 2012. Results demonstrate the proposed PAR method can significantly shorten the time to first fix (TTFF) and increase the fixing rate. Compared with FAR, the average TTFF for PAR is reduced by 14.9% for static PPP and 15.1% for kinematic PPP. Besides, using the PAR method, the average fixing rate can be increased from 83.5% to 98.2% for static PPP, from 80.1% to 95.2% for kinematic PPP respectively. Kinematic PPP accuracy with PAR can also be significantly improved, compared to that with FAR, due to a higher fixing rate. ",

        "abstract": "Integer ambiguity resolution in Precise Point Positioning (PPP) can shorten convergence time and improve accuracy significantly. Uncalibrated Fractional Offsets (UFOs) originating in the satellites destroy the integer nature of carrier phase ambiguities observed at a single station. Several methods have been developed to estimate UFO information from a reference network for PPP ambiguity resolution. In this paper, we present a new approach for estimating Zero-Differenced (ZD) UFOs via float ZD ambiguities from a reference network. In this new approach, UFOs for receivers and satellites are estimated in an integrated adjustment with integer ambiguities being resolved sequentially, so that UFOs of higher quality can be achieved. The float ZD ambiguities used in the estimation can be from network or PPP solutions. Using those from PPP solutions enables the time-consuming clock estimations and the UFO estimations to be carried out separately, so that UFOs can be estimated more reliably from a much denser network. In this paper, a data processing procedure, from the estimation of UFOs through to PPP ambiguity fixing, is designed and proposed. The approach is validated with several data sets in various scenarios. The results show that satellite UFOs can be estimated precisely and reliably by using the observations from a reference network, in which the station spacing could be up to thousands of kilometres. With 30 minutes of observations, a PPP solution with fixed integer ambiguities is achievable and the positioning accuracy can be improved significantly when compared with its float solution.

        "abstract": "Cycle slip detection and correction are important issues when carrier phase observations are used in high-precision GNSS data processing and have, therefore, been intensively investigated. Along with the GNSS modernization, the cycle slip correction (CSC) problem has been raised to deal with more signals from multi-frequencies. We extend the geometry-based approach by integrating time-differenced pseudorange and carrier phase observations to estimate the integer number of triple-frequency cycle slips together with the receiver clock offset, ionospheric delay variations and receiver displacements. The Least-squares AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment method can be employed. The benefit of the third frequency observation on the cycle slip estimate is first investigated with simulation tests. The results show that adding the third frequency observation can significantly improve the model strength and that a reliable triple-frequency CSC with a theoretical success rate of higher than 99.9 % can still be achieved, even under the condition that the range or ionosphere delay variation is poorly defined. The performance of triple-frequency CSC is validated with real triple-frequency BDS data since all BDS satellites in orbit are transmitting triple-frequency signals. The results show that the fixing rate of CSC can reach 99.1 % in static precise point positioning (PPP) and 98.8 % in the kinematic case. PPP solutions with cycle slip-uncorrected and cycle slip-corrected data sets are compared to validate the correctness of triple-frequency CSC. The standard deviations of the PPP solution in east, north and vertical component, respectively, can be improved by 31.1, 30.7 and 37.6 % for static, and by 42.0, 53.8 and 39.7 % for kinematic after cycle slips are corrected. The performance of dual- and triple-frequency CSC is also compared. Results show that the performance of dual-frequency CSC is slightly worse than that of triple-frequency CSC. These results demonstrate that the performance of CSC can be significantly improved with triple-frequency observations.",

We test four ambiguity resolution (AR) methods which are applicable to triple-frequency observations. These are least squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA), GF-TCAR (geometry-free three-carrier ambiguity resolution), GB-TCAR (geometry-based three-carrier ambiguity resolution) and GIF-TCAR (three-carrier ambiguity resolution based on the geometry-free and ionospheric-free combination). A comparison between LAMBDA, GF-TCAR and GB-TCAR was conducted over three short baselines and two medium baselines. The results indicated that LAMBDA is optimal in both short baseline and medium baseline cases. However, the performances of GB-TCAR and LAMBDA differ slightly for short baselines. Compared with GF-TCAR, which uses the geometry-free model, the GB-TCAR using the geometry-based model improves the AR performance significantly. Compared with dual-frequency observations, the LAMBDA AR results show a significant improvement when using triple-frequency observations over short baselines. The performance of GIF-TCAR is evaluated using multi-epoch observations. The results indicated that multi-path errors on carrier phases will have a significant influence on GIF-TCAR AR results, which leads to different GIF-TCAR AR performance for different type of satellites. For GEO (Geostationary Orbit) satellites, the ambiguities can barely be correctly fixed because the multi-path errors on carrier phases are very systematic. For IGSO (Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites, when the elevation cutoff angle is set as 30\u00b0, several tens to several hundreds of epochs are needed for correctly fixing the narrow lane ambiguities. The comparison of positioning performance between dual-frequency observations and triple-frequency observations was also conducted. The results indicated that a minor improvement can be achieved by using triple-frequency observations compared with using dual-frequency observations.",

        "abstract": "Due to the application of frequency division multiple access, the signals of GLONASS satellites suffer from code and carrier phase inter-frequency biases (IFBs). In this study, the effects of GLONASS code IFBs on differential code bias (DCB) estimation and ionospheric modeling are investigated. The observational data from more than 130 MGEX stations for a period of 60 days are used to generate the DCB products, with and without considering the GLONASS code IFB. According to the results, residuals of the DCB estimation without GLONASS code IFB consideration exhibit frequency-dependent systematic errors, errors that can be eliminated when the GLONASS code IFB is taken into account. The GLONASS inter-frequency differential code bias (IFDCB), defined as the difference of the sum of satellite and receiver DCB estimates without and with GLONASS code IFB consideration, is taken to represent the difference between the two DCB estimation types. The IFDCBs are generally in the range of \u00b14 and \u00b12 ns for C1P---C2P and C1C---C1P, respectively, and the largest difference of the C1P---C2P IFDCBs between frequency channels is 7 ns. The VTEC products of ionospheric modeling with and without the consideration of the GLONASS code IFB are also generated based on data from 30 days of MGEX and IGS networks. The mean difference and standard deviation between them are 0.53---1.13 and 0.98---1.75 TECU, respectively.",

        "abstract": "For mobile surveying and mapping applications, tightly coupled integration of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and Strap down Inertial Navigation System is usually recommended for direct georeferencing since it can provide position, velocity, and attitude information at higher accuracy and better reliability in a self-contained manner. A post-mission smoothing method is applied to optimally use observation information of both systems and to overcome the shortcomings of Kalman filter in GNSS degraded environments. We propose the revised Rauch---Tung---Streibel Smoother (RTSS) and Forward---Backward combination (FBC) smoothing algorithms for tightly coupled integration. From the analysis and field test, it is found that RTSS smoothing mainly improves the relative accuracy, while FBC mainly contributes to the absolute accuracy. With the complementary characteristics of both smoothing algorithms, an optimal new smoothing scheme combining RTSS with FBC is built. The performance of these three smoothing algorithms is evaluated through a real vehicular test. Compared with RTSS and FBC smoothing algorithms, the new smoothing scheme improves the mean 3D position RMS and the mean 3D attitude RMS by 65.7 and 70%, respectively. It provides better accuracy and smoothness for the position, velocity, and attitude at the same time.",

        "abstract": "The focus is on the quality assessment of precise orbit and clock products for the emerging Galileo, BeiDou, and QZSS systems. Products provided by Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) over 2 years are used for evaluation. First, the products are assessed by orbit and clock comparisons among individual analysis centers (ACs), which give us an objective impression of their consistency. In addition, the precise orbits are verified by satellite laser ranging (SLR) residuals, which can be regarded as indicators of orbit accuracy. Moreover, precise point positioning (PPP) tests are conducted to further verify the quality of MGEX precise orbits and clocks. Orbit comparisons show agreements of about 0.1---0.25 m for Galileo, 0.1---0.2 m for BeiDou MEOs, 0.2---0.3 m for BeiDou IGSOs, and 0.2---0.4 m for QZSS. The BeiDou GEO orbits, however, have the worst agreements having a few meters differences. Clock comparisons of individual ACs have a consistency of 0.2---0.4 ns for Galileo, 0.2---0.3 ns for BeiDou IGSOs, 0.15---0.2 ns for BeiDou MEOs, 0.5---0.8 ns for BeiDou GEOs, and 0.4---0.8 ns for QZSS in general. The SLR validations demonstrate an accuracy of about 0.1 m for the current Galileo, BeiDou IGSO/MEO orbits, and about 0.2 m for QZSS orbits. However, the SLR residuals of BeiDou GEO orbits show a systematic bias of about \u017a0.5 m together with a standard deviation of 0.3 m. Solutions of PPP with different products mostly agree well with each other, which further confirms the good consistency of orbits and clocks among ACs. After convergence, an accuracy of 1 mm to 1 cm for static PPP and a few centimeters for kinematic PPP is achieved using multi-GNSS observations and MGEX orbit and clock products. However, it should be noted that a few exceptions may exist throughout the evaluations due to the insufficient models, different processing strategies, and ongoing updates applied by individual ACs.",

        "abstract": "The Hatch---Melbourne---W\u00fcbbena (HMW) combination is a geometry-free and ionospheric-free (first-order) function that has been widely used for cycle slip detection and ambiguity resolution in GNSS dual-frequency data processing. We investigate the characteristics of HMW combinations for BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS) observations for different types of satellites. We first study the characteristics of BDS undifferenced (UD) HMW combinations. Obvious systematic errors are found on BDS UD HMW combinations. The characteristics of single-differenced (SD) and double-differenced (DD) HMW combinations are then analyzed. The results indicate that the biases do not cancel in single-differencing between two satellites. On the contrary, they are amplified because of the superposition of the systematic biases of two satellite signals. In single-differencing between two receivers, different characteristics are found for different satellites types depending on baseline length. For inclined geostationary orbit (IGSO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), the systematic biases cancel for single-differencing between receivers or double-differencing over short and medium baselines; however, they do not cancel in single-differencing between receivers or double-differencing over long baselines. Regarding geostationary earth orbit (GEO), the systematic biases do not cancel for single-differencing between receivers or double-differencing over both short and long baselines. In addition, we analyze the sources of the systematic biases of the BDS HMW combination. The systematic biases of IGSO and MEO HMW combinations mainly originate from multipath errors at the satellite; the systematic biases of GEO HMW combinations may also originate from multipath errors. Finally, we study the influence of the systematic errors on wide-lane ambiguity resolution by analyzing the consistency of the fractional part of the averaged SD HMW combinations and the fixing rate of DD wide-lane ambiguity resolution. The results are compared with those of GPS.",

As a satellite-based positioning technology, the QISPP is expected to improve the accuracy and availability of positioning solutions due to the increased number of visible satellites and the improved satellite sky distribution.

        "abstract": "To fast estimate high-dimensional ambiguities, we propose a new lattice reduction algorithm based on QR decomposition, which achieves fast integer transformation through an iterative strategy of whole size reduction and the deep insertion of minimum basis vectors. It acquires better basis vectors for ambiguity resolution. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing its performance with those of LAMBDA, LLL, the parallel Cholesky-based reduction algorithm with ascending sorting (ASCE), and a modified LLL algorithm with deep insertions (PotLLL) under three experimental scenarios. The Hermite defect and defined length ratio are used to measure the reduction quality. Both metrics verify that our proposed method acquires a good reduced basis for accelerating the ambiguity search. To evaluate the practical ambiguity resolution behaviour, we tracked the runtime of ambiguity resolution. The results show that the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm is better than those of the ...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, the spatial patterns and vertical structure of atmospheric temperature anomalies, in both the tropics and the extratropical latitudes, associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the upper troposphere and stratosphere are investigated using global positioning system (GPS) radio occultation (RO) measurements from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) Formosa Satellite Mission 3 mission from July 2006 to February 2014. We find that negative correlations between the atmospheric temperature in the tropics and ENSO are observed at 17\u201330\u00a0km in the lower stratosphere at a lag of 1\u20134 months and at a lead of 1 month. Out-of-phase temperature variation is observed in the troposphere over the mid-latitude band and in-phase behaviour is observed in the lower stratosphere. Interestingly, we also find that there is a significant negative correlation at a lag of 1\u20133 months from 32\u00a0km to 40\u00a0km in the mid-latitude region of the Northern Hemisphere. The atmospheric temperature variations over mid-latitude regions in both hemispheres are closely related to the QBO. There are also two narrow zones over the subtropical jet zone where the QBO signals are strong in both hemispheres, approximately parallel to the equator. Finally, we develop a new robust index to describe the strength of the ENSO and QBO signal.",

        "title": "Initial assessment of the COMPASS/BeiDou-3: new-generation navigation signals",
        "abstract": "The successful launch of five new-generation experimental satellites of the China\u2019s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, namely BeiDou I1-S, I2-S, M1-S, M2-S, and M3-S, marks a significant step in expanding BeiDou into a navigation system with global coverage. In addition to B1I (1561.098\u00a0MHz) and B3I (1269.520\u00a0MHz) signals, the new-generation BeiDou-3 experimental satellites are also capable of transmitting several new navigation signals in space, namely B1C at 1575.42\u00a0MHz, B2a at 1176.45\u00a0MHz, and B2b at 1207.14\u00a0MHz. For the first time, we present an initial characterization and performance assessment for these new-generation BeiDou-3 satellites and their signals. The L1/L2/L5 signals from GPS Block IIF satellites, E1/E5a/E5b signals from Galileo satellites, and B1I/B2I/B3I signals from BeiDou-2 satellites are also evaluated for comparison. The characteristics of the B1C, B1I, B2a, B2b, and B3I signals are evaluated in terms of observed carrier-to-noise density ratio, pseudorange multipath and noise, triple-frequency carrier-phase ionosphere-free and geometry-free combination, and double-differenced carrier-phase and code residuals. The results demonstrate that the observational quality of the new-generation BeiDou-3 signals is comparable to that of GPS L1/L2/L5 and Galileo E1/E5a/E5b signals. However, the analysis of code multipath shows that the elevation-dependent code biases, which have been previously identified to exist in the code observations of the BeiDou-2 satellites, seem to be not obvious for all the available signals of the new-generation BeiDou-3 satellites. This will significantly benefit precise applications that resolve wide-lane ambiguity based on Hatch\u2013Melbourne\u2013W\u00fcbbena linear combinations and other applications such as single-frequency precise point positioning (PPP) based on the ionosphere-free code\u2013carrier combinations. Furthermore, with regard to the triple-frequency carrier-phase ionosphere-free and geometry-free combination, it is found that different from the BeiDou-2 and GPS Block IIF satellites, no apparent bias variations could be observed in all the new-generation BeiDou-3 experimental satellites, which shows a good consistency of the new-generation BeiDou-3 signals. The absence of such triple-frequency biases simplifies the potential processing of multi-frequency PPP using observations from the new-generation BeiDou-3 satellites. Finally, the precise relative positioning results indicate that the additional observations from the new-generation BeiDou-3 satellites can improve ambiguity resolution performance with respect to BeiDou-2 only positioning, which indicates that observations from the new-generation BeiDou-3 satellites can contribute to precise relative positioning.",

        "abstract": "In precise relative positioning applications, an effective approach to improve the interoperability of GNSS systems is the tightly combining or inter-system double-differencing of observations from the common frequencies that are shared by different constellations. As the BeiDou satellites are currently transmitting a B2 signal at 1207.14 MHz that is identical to the Galileo E5b signal, the inter-system double-differenced observations can also be created between observations from both systems at that particular frequency. In this paper, we will focus on the instantaneous ambiguity resolution performance analysis of tightly combining BeiDou B2 and Galileo E5b observations. The size and stability of phase and code Differential Inter-System Biases (DISBs) between BeiDou B2 and Galileo E5b signals are first investigated, in which the new BeiDou and Galileo satellites launched recently will also be included. Then, first results of the Tightly Combined Model (TCM) with  a priori  corrected DISBs (TCM_C) are evaluated in comparison to the Loosely Combined Model (LCM) and tightly combined model with unknown DISBs (TCM_F) in an instantaneous approach. It is demonstrated that the instantaneous integer ambiguity resolution performance can be improved using the TCM_C with respect to LCM and TCM_F.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   With the recent revitalization of GLONASS constellation and two newly emerging constellations of BeiDou and Galileo, multi-constellation integration has become a trend in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) development. In order to provide a good indication of the positioning and navigation performance under the current GNSS constellations for the global users, the availability of four-constellation integration with GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo should be investigated. In this study, the availability with the use of 31\u00a0GPS satellites, 24 GLONASS satellites, 18 BeiDou satellites and 11 Galileo satellites on a global scale is evaluated in terms of the number of visible satellites, the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) and the percentage of time span over which the position solutions can be acquired over the total time span during approximately a repeat cycle of orbits for all types of satellites. The effects of compatibility between different satellite systems on availability are discussed. In addition, datasets collected at 59 globally distributed four-system stations on 30 consecutive days are employed to fully assess the performance of four-constellation integrated dual-frequency precise point positioning (PPP), single-frequency PPP and single point positioning (SPP). The results indicate that the multi-constellation integration can significantly improve the availability and positioning accuracy. The enhancement of compatibility can also improve the availability. The availability can reflect the positioning performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Kinematic acceleration estimated using the global positioning system (GPS) is significant for airborne scalar gravimetry. As the conventional approach based on the differential global positioning system (DGPS) presents several drawbacks, including additional cost or the impracticality of setting up nearby base stations in challenging environments, we introduce an alternative approach, Modified Kin-VADASE (MKin-VADASE), based on a modified Kin-VADASE approach without the requirement to have ground-base stations. In this approach, the aircraft velocities are first estimated with the modified Kin-VADASE. Then the accelerations are obtained from velocity estimates using the Taylor approximation differentiator. The impact of carrier-phase measurement noise and satellite ephemeris errors on acceleration estimates are investigated carefully in the frequency domain with the Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm (FFT). The results show that the satellite clock products have a significant impact on the acceleration estimates. Then, the performance of MKin-VADASE, PPP, and DGPS are validated using flight tests carried out in Shanxi Province, China. The accelerations are estimated using the three approaches, then used to calculate the gravity disturbances. Finally, the analysis of crossover difference and the terrestrial gravity data are used to evaluate the accuracy of gravity disturbance estimates. The results show that the performances of MKin-VADASE, PPP and DGPS are comparable, but the computational complexity of MKin-VADASE is greatly reduced with regard to PPP and DGPS. For the results of the three approaches, the RMS of crossover differences of gravity disturbance estimates is approximately 1\u20131.5\u00a0mGal at a spatial resolution of 3.5\u00a0km (half wavelength) after crossover adjustment, and the accuracy is approximately 3\u20134\u00a0mGal with respect to terrestrial gravity data.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the precise point positioning (PPP) ambiguity resolution (AR) using the observations acquired from four systems: GPS, BDS, GLONASS, and Galileo (GCRE). A GCRE four-system uncalibrated phase delay (UPD) estimation model and multi-GNSS undifferenced PPP AR method were developed in order to utilize the observations from all systems. For UPD estimation, the GCRE-combined PPP solutions of the globally distributed MGEX and IGS stations are performed to obtain four-system float ambiguities and then UPDs of GCRE satellites can be precisely estimated from these ambiguities. The quality of UPD products in terms of temporal stability and residual distributions is investigated for GPS, BDS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellites, respectively. The BDS satellite-induced code biases were corrected for GEO, IGSO, and MEO satellites before the UPD estimation. The UPD results of global and regional networks were also evaluated for Galileo and BDS, respectively. As a result of the frequency-division multiple-access strategy of GLONASS, the UPD estimation was performed using a network of homogeneous receivers including three commonly used GNSS receivers (TRIMBLE NETR9, JAVAD TRE_G3TH DELTA, and LEICA). Data recorded from 140 MGEX and IGS stations for a 30-day period in January in 2017 were used to validate the proposed GCRE UPD estimation and multi-GNSS dual-frequency PPP AR. Our results show that GCRE four-system PPP AR enables the fastest time to first fix (TTFF) solutions and the highest accuracy for all three coordinate components compared to the single and dual system. An average TTFF of 9.21 min with (7{^{circ }}) cutoff elevation angle can be achieved for GCRE PPP AR, which is much shorter than that of GPS (18.07 min), GR (12.10 min), GE (15.36 min) and GC (13.21 min). With observations length of 10 min, the positioning accuracy of the GCRE fixed solution is 1.84, 1.11, and 1.53 cm, while the GPS-only result is 2.25, 1.29, and 9.73 cm for the east, north, and vertical components, respectively. When the cutoff elevation angle is increased to (30{^{circ }}), the GPS-only PPP AR results are very unreliable, while 13.44 min of TTFF is still achievable for GCRE four-system solutions.",

The BDS-3 satellites are able to transmit several new navigation frequencies including B1C at 1575.42\u202fMHz, B2a at 1176.45\u202fMHz, and B2b at 1207.14\u202fMHz, in addition to B1 (1561.098\u202fMHz) and B3 (1268.520\u202fMHz) frequencies transmitted by BDS-2 satellites. Since the satellite-induced and elevation-dependent code biases were observed for the 14 older BDS-2 satellites (C01-C14), a comprehensive analysis and characterization of the code observations for the BDS-3 satellites were conducted based on observation data collected at 14 stations including 13 of the International GNSS Monitoring and Assessment System (IGMAS) and one station named SGG0 operated at the School of Geodesy and Geomatics (SGG) of Wuhan University. The Multipath (MP) combination, Melbourne-Wubbena (MW) combination and wide-lane uncalibrated phase delays (UPDs) are calculated to verify the existence and magnitude of the satellite-induced code bias for the BDS-3 satellites. The elevation-dependent polynomial models of MP combination for BDS-3 satellites were also established in order to analyze the characteristic of satellite-induced bias observed at different receiver types or different frequencies. For comparison, the MP combination of a newly launched BDS-2 satellite I6 was also calculated. The results indicate that the satellite-induced code bias is negligible for the BDS-3 satellites while newly launched BDS-2 satellite I6 has similar elevation-dependent code bias as the 14 older BDS-2 satellites.",

        "abstract": "In this contribution, we focus on the precise orbit determination (POD) for BDS3 experimental satellites with the international GNSS Monitoring and Assessment System (iGMAS) and Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) tracking networks. The datasets of DOY (day of year) 001-230 in 2017 are analyzed with different processing strategies. By comparing receiver clock biases and receiver B1I\u2013B3I DCBs, it is confirmed that there is no obvious systematic bias between experimental BDS3 and BDS2 in the common B1I and B3I signals, which indicates that experimental BDS3 and BDS2 can be treated as one system when performing combined POD. With iGMAS-only BDS3 stations, the 24-h overlap RMS of \\(\\hbox {BDS}3\\,+\\,\\hbox {BDS}2\\,+\\,\\hbox {GPS}\\) combined POD is 24.3, 16.1 and 8.4\u00a0cm in along-track, cross-track and radial components, which is better than BDS3-only POD by 80\u201390% and better than \\(\\hbox {BDS}3+\\hbox {BDS}2\\) combined POD by about 10%. With more stations (totally 20 stations from both iGMAS and MGEX) and the proper ambiguity resolution strategy (GEO ambiguities are float and BDS3 ambiguities are fixed), the performance of BDS3 POD can be further improved to 14.6, 7.9 and 3.7\u00a0cm, respectively, in along-track, cross-track and radial components, which is comparable to the performance of BDS2 POD. The 230-day SLR validations of C32, C33 and C34 show that the mean differences of \\(-\\,3.48\\), 7.81 and 8.19\u00a0cm can be achieved, while the STD is 13.35, 13.46 and 13.11\u00a0cm, respectively. Furthermore, the 230-day overlap comparisons reveal that C31 most likely still uses an orbit-normal mode and exhibits similar orbit modeling problems in orbit-normal periods as found in most of the BDS2 satellites.",

        "abstract": "In this contribution, the BDS3 differential code biases (DCBs) are estimated by using the iGMAS and MEGX networks and the performance of both satellite and receiver DCBs for BDS3 is evaluated with the observational data during the period of DOY 1\u2013180, 2017. The characteristics of BDS3 and BDS2 DCB are compared, and the code inter-system biases (ISB) between BDS3 and BDS2 are also analyzed in detail. The comparison of our estimated BDS C2I-C6I and C2I-C7I DCBs and the DLR and IGG products shows a good agreement. For BDS2, the mean differences are within \\( \\pm \\,0.2\\,{\\text{ns}} \\) and STDs are within 0.15\u00a0ns. However, the BDS3 presents a larger difference, with the mean difference of about 0.35\u00a0ns, because fewer stations are included in the DLR/IGG processing. The comparison of BDS3 and BDS2 DCB shows that the receiver DCB differences between BDS3 and BDS2 are close to zero for the same network, i.e., iGMAS or MGEX. In other words, there is no significant systematic bias between BDS3 and BDS2 receiver DCB. However, when the iGMAS and MGEX networks are processed together, we found that the receiver DCB differences between BDS3 and BDS2 are not close to zero and present an obvious systematic bias between different networks. The further analysis of code ISB between BDS3 and BDS2 also shows a similar phenomenon. Therefore, the receiver DCB of BDS3 and BDS2 should be separately estimated or calibrated when iGMAS and MGEX networks are processed together. We also analyze the receiver DCB and code ISB between Galileo FOC and IOV satellites and found that there is no such systematic bias between Galileo FOC and IOV satellites. A 180-day analysis of estimated BDS3 and BDS2 DCB shows that the satellite DCBs of BDS3 are fairly stable, with a mean STD of about 0.18\u00a0ns. For BDS2, the IGSO DCBs are the most stable with a mean STD of about 0.09\u00a0ns, and the GEO DCBs exhibit the worst stability with a mean STD of about 0.18\u00a0ns. The mean STDs of receiver DCBs for BDS3 and BDS2 are 0.38 and 0.41\u00a0ns, respectively, and the STD of receiver DCBs of BDS3 is smaller than that of BDS2 at most stations.",

        "abstract": "Because of the demand for seamless indoor and outdoor positioning of mass-market applications, several simple and efficient pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) systems have been introduced. However, the performance of the PDR system would significantly decrease with the increase of recursion time, due to the influence of sensors and model error. This paper discusses the overview of the pedestrian navigation system and the implementation of key techniques of PDR, then proposes an improved PDR system with precise displacement estimation based on time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) technique. Using the derived position change and heading from TDCP as updating information, the bias of stride and heading of the modeled PDR system will be estimated through a sliding window. The field test results demonstrate that the errors of gyroscope heading and compass heading show different characteristics, and there is a linearly increased error of gyroscope heading. The max errors of accumulated displacement of TDCP are about 5.32 m, and using pure PDR after trained by TDCP, the max error values of short-term and long-term navigation are approximately 5.97 and 14.88 m, respectively. From the point view of cumulative probability, for the probability of 80%, the horizontal errors of accumulated displacement of TDCP is only 3.78 m, and values of short-term and long-term navigation reach to 4.15 m and 11.78 m, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed algorithm is stable and practical to the continuous pedestrian navigation during the intermittent global navigation satellite system observation condition.",

        "abstract": "The fast motion of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite contributes to the geometric diversity, allowing for rapid convergence of precise point positioning (PPP). In this contribution, we investigate the PPP performance of the LEO constellation-augmented full operational capability (FOC) multi-GNSS. We design six LEO constellations with different satellite numbers, orbit altitudes and orbit types, together with the FOC multi-GNSS constellations, and then simulate both the onboard LEO and ground-based observations. The multi-GNSS POD result shows much better orbit accuracy of 3.3, 2.7 and 2.6\u00a0cm in radial, along-track and cross-track components, respectively, compared with that of 10.3, 9.2 and 8.9\u00a0cm for GPS-only POD. Furthermore, the performance of LEO-augmented multi-GNSS PPP is evaluated. With the augmentation of 60-, 96-, 192- and 288-satellite LEO constellation, the multi-GNSS PPP convergence time can be shortened from 9.6 to 7.0, 3.2, 2.1 and 1.3\u00a0min, respectively, in midlatitude region. For LEO-augmented GPS- and BDS-only PPP, the improvement is more significant with the convergence time dramatically shortened by 90% from about 25 to within 3\u00a0min with 192- or 288-satellite constellation. The augmentation capability is also found to be associated with station latitude, and the higher latitude, the better performance. To enable about more than 70% significant reduction on convergence time, as well as considering the cost, the 192-satellite LEO constellation scheme is suggested. In terms of orbit altitude, the scheme of 1000\u00a0km presents better performance than that of 600\u00a0km. As for orbit type, the performances are comparable for polar and sun-synchronous orbits. Additionally, LEO-only PPP can be achieved with the convergence time of about 6.5\u00a0min.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) kinematic positioning, observations will be inevitably contaminated by cycle slips and gross errors, as the complex observation environment changes rapidly. These outliers will degrade the performance of classic Kalman filtering applied in GNSS kinematic resolution and eventually, the filtering may converge slowly or even diverge and thus the precision will be degraded. Therefore, a robust Kalman filter should be applied to resist the influence of these outliers that cannot be identified in the data preprocessing stage. Based on the conventional IGG (Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics) III equivalent weight method which addresses the outliers of the zero-weight segment with the same strategy, this paper proposes an improved robust Kalman filtering strategy that detects outliers by both posterior phase residuals and standardized residuals and handles the carrier-phase observation of zero-weight segment as cycle slips. In addition, to avoid unnecessary ambiguity reinitialization caused by the detected cycle slips, only when the carrier-phase observation of the same satellite is classified in the zero-weight segment over two consecutive epochs should the ambiguity be reinitialized. Experimental results of relative positioning show that the improved method can not only mitigate the influence of unexpected outliers in the Kalman filter but also improve the fixing rate of ambiguity resolution as well as the accuracy and reliability of positioning.",

        "abstract": "As a cost-effective remote sensing technique, global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) has recently drawn significant attention from both academia and industry. However, research on GNSS-R has mainly been focused on the global positioning system which consists of only medium earth orbit satellites, while the use of geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites, such as those in BeiDou navigation satellite system, has received little attention. This paper investigates the GEO-satellite-based GNSS-R with a focus on the application of soil moisture retrieval. Because GEO satellites remain static with the earth, the models of the reflected GNSS signals can be considerably simplified and their signals can be used to estimate soil moisture with a high update rate such as once per hour. Two new soil moisture estimation approaches using GEO signals are proposed, which are termed GEO interferometric reflectometry (GEO-IR) and GEO reflectometry (GEO-R). Two theoretical models (linear and second order) are developed for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based GEO-IR as well as for phase-based GEO-IR. Meanwhile, two empirical models (linear and second order) are developed for signal amplitude-based GEO-R as well as for SNR ratio-based GEO-R. Experimental data sets collected from three different geographical regions were used to evaluate the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed GEO-IR and GEO-R are able to monitor soil moisture reliably under bare soil condition, augmenting GNSS-R through significantly reduced processing complexity and increased temporal coverage.",

        "abstract": "The code-phase divergences, which are minimal for GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellites, are commonly found in BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) Geostationary Orbit (GEO), Inclined GeoSynchronous Orbit (IGSO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. Several precise positioning applications which use code observations are severely affected by these code biases. We present an analysis of code bias based on multipath (MP) combination observations. To mitigate the effect of BDS code bias on precise positioning, we proposed a periodical correction method using a low-pass filter for BDS GEO, IGSO and MEO satellites. The auto-correlation of MP series over long periods is analyzed to obtain the periods of the dominant repeating components for three types of BDS satellites. The periods of the dominant daily repeating components are close to 86,160\u00a0s for BDS GEO and IGSO satellites while 603,120\u00a0s for MEO satellites. The zero phase-shift low-pass filter was used to extract the low-frequency components of MP series and then low-frequency components are applied to mitigate the code bias periodically. The developed correction methods can make a more remarkable improvement for the accuracy of MP series, compared to the current elevation-dependent correction models. Data sets collected at 50 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ground stations including 15 of the International GNSS Monitoring and Assessment System (iGMAS) and 35 of the Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) stations are employed for this study. To analyze the influence of code bias on precise positioning and validate the effectiveness of the correction methods, some applications such as single point positioning (SPP), wide-lane (WL) ambiguity analysis and Uncalibrated Phase Delays (UPDs) estimation are conducted. After applying the proposal correction method to the code observations, SPP solutions outperform the uncorrected ones in term of positioning accuracy. The positioning accuracy decreased by 0.28 and 0.1\u00a0m in the north and east components and the improvements are more significant for the U components decreased by 0.42\u00a0m. In addition, the systematic variations of Melbourne-W\u00fcbbena (MW) combination are greatly removed and the convergence time of the MW series are decreased. Moreover, significant improvement is also achieved in terms of the usage rate and residuals of UPDs estimation.",

        "abstract": "Attitude determination based on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is characterized by high-precision, low-cost, and no error accumulation. However, GNSS harsh-signal environments will degrade the accuracy and reliability of GNSS attitude. In this case, micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensors are often integrated with dual-antenna GNSS for more reliable and continuous attitude determination. In this paper, we fused dual-antenna GNSS and MEMS to acquire heading, pitch, and roll with high accuracy in GNSS challenged environments. Instead of a Euler angle representation, the misalignment is used to build the state model in the integrated Kalman filter. Attitudes derived from dual-antenna GNSS and smoothed acceleration are adopted as measurements. It can be found that this filtering architecture is actually a subset of loosely coupled GNSS/MEMS integration. Therefore, the proposed module can be easily embedded into loosely coupled integration. In addition, due to the disadvantage that GNSS is sensitive to signal interference and obstacles, the fault detection and exclusion strategy was proposed to avoid the filtering divergence and to improve the reliability of attitude determination. Finally, two vehicular tests with a 1.12-m baseline conducted in GNSS friendly and challenged environments showed that the proposed attitude determination algorithm could detect and exclude all GNSS-attitude outliers, thus achieve the high accuracy of 0.2\u00b0, 0.39\u00b0, and 0.28\u00b0 for heading, pitch, and roll angles in the challenged environment, respectively. With the MEMS-gyroscope aiding, the attitude gaps caused by GNSS outages are bridged. For a 300-s outage duration, the average accumulated attitudes errors are 2.37\u00b0, 0.88\u00b0, and 1.40\u00b0.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the precise point positioning (PPP) ambiguity resolution (AR) using the observations acquired from four systems: GPS, BDS, GLONASS, and Galileo (GCRE). A GCRE four-system uncalibrated phase delay (UPD) estimation model and multi-GNSS undifferenced PPP AR method were developed in order to utilize the observations from all systems. For UPD estimation, the GCRE-combined PPP solutions of the globally distributed MGEX and IGS stations are performed to obtain four-system float ambiguities and then UPDs of GCRE satellites can be precisely estimated from these ambiguities. The quality of UPD products in terms of temporal stability and residual distributions is investigated for GPS, BDS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellites, respectively. The BDS satellite-induced code biases were corrected for GEO, IGSO, and MEO satellites before the UPD estimation. The UPD results of global and regional networks were also evaluated for Galileo and BDS, respectively. As a result of the frequency-division multiple-access strategy of GLONASS, the UPD estimation was performed using a network of homogeneous receivers including three commonly used GNSS receivers (TRIMBLE NETR9, JAVAD TRE_G3TH DELTA, and LEICA). Data recorded from 140 MGEX and IGS stations for a 30-day period in January in 2017 were used to validate the proposed GCRE UPD estimation and multi-GNSS dual-frequency PPP AR. Our results show that GCRE four-system PPP AR enables the fastest time to first fix (TTFF) solutions and the highest accuracy for all three coordinate components compared to the single and dual system. An average TTFF of 9.21 min with \\(7{^{\\circ }}\\) cutoff elevation angle can be achieved for GCRE PPP AR, which is much shorter than that of GPS (18.07 min), GR (12.10 min), GE (15.36 min) and GC (13.21 min). With observations length of 10 min, the positioning accuracy of the GCRE fixed solution is 1.84, 1.11, and 1.53\u00a0cm, while the GPS-only result is 2.25, 1.29, and 9.73\u00a0cm for the east, north, and vertical components, respectively. When the cutoff elevation angle is increased to \\(30{^{\\circ }}\\), the GPS-only PPP AR results are very unreliable, while 13.44 min of TTFF is still achievable for GCRE four-system solutions.",

        "title": "Tightly combined GPS/Galileo RTK for short and long baselines: Model and performance analysis",
        "abstract": "Abstract   To ensure the compatibility and interoperability with modernized GPS, Galileo satellites are capable of broadcasting navigation signals on carrier phase frequencies that overlap with GPS, i.e., GPS/Galileo L1-E1/L5-E5a. Moreover, the GPS/Galileo L2-E5b signals have different frequencies with wavelength differences smaller than 4.2\u202fmm. Such overlapping and narrowly spaced signals between GPS and Galileo bring the opportunity to use the tightly combined double-differenced (DD) model for precise real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning, resulting in improved performance of ambiguity resolution and positioning with respect to the classical standard or loosely combined DD model. In this paper, we focus on the model and performance assessment of tightly combined GPS/Galileo L1-E1/L2-E5b/L5-E5a RTK for short and long baselines. We first investigate the tightly combined GPS/Galileo DD observational model for both short and long baselines with simultaneously considering the GPS/Galileo overlapping and non-overlapping frequencies. Particularly, we introduce a reparameterization approach to solve the rank deficiency that caused by the correlation between the DISB parameters and the DD ionospheric parameters for both overlapping and non-overlapping frequencies. Then we present performance assessment for the tightly combined GPS/Galileo RTK model with real-time estimation of the differential inter-system bias (DISB) parameters for short and long baselines in terms of ratio value, ambiguity dilution of precision (ADOP), ambiguity conditional number, decorrelation number, search count, empirical success rate, time-to-first-fix (TTFF), and positioning accuracy. Results from both static and kinematic experiments demonstrated that compared to the loosely combined model, the tightly combined model can deliver improved performance of ambiguity resolution and precise positioning with different satellite visibility. For the car-driven short baseline experiment with 10\u00b0 elevation cut-off angle, the tightly combined model can not only significantly increase the ratio value by approximately 27.5% (from 16.0 to 20.4), but also reduce the ambiguity ADOP, the conditional number, and the search count in LAMBDA by approximately 22.2% (from 0.027 to 0.021 cycles), 14.9% (from 199.2 to 169.6), and 25.4% (from 150.1 to 112.0), respectively. Comparable decorrelation number, empirical success rate, and positioning accuracy are also obtained. For the car-driven long baseline experiment, it is also observed that the ambiguity resolution performance in terms of the ratio value, the decorrelation number, the condition number, and the search count are significantly improved by approximately 18.5% (from 2.7 to 3.2), 22.0% (from 0.186 to 0.227), 55.9% (from 937.6 to 413.7), and 10.3% (from 43.8 to 39.3), respectively. Moreover, comparable ADOP, empirical success rate, and positioning accuracy are obtained as well. Additionally, the TTFF can be reduced (from 54.1 to 51.8 epochs with 10\u00b0 elevation cut-off angle) as well from the results of static experiments.",

        "abstract": "Many applications, such as marine navigation, land vehicles location, etc., require real time precise positioning under medium or long baseline conditions. In this contribution, we develop a model of real-time kinematic decimeter-level positioning with BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) triple-frequency signals over medium distances. The ambiguities of two extra-wide-lane (EWL) combinations are fixed first, and then a wide lane (WL) combination is reformed based on the two EWL combinations for positioning. Theoretical analysis and empirical analysis is given of the ambiguity fixing rate and the positioning accuracy of the presented method. The results indicate that the ambiguity fixing rate can be up to more than 98% when using BDS medium baseline observations, which is much higher than that of dual-frequency Hatch-Melbourne-W\u00fcbbena (HMW) method. As for positioning accuracy, decimeter level accuracy can be achieved with this method, which is comparable to that of carrier-smoothed code differential positioning method. Signal interruption simulation experiment indicates that the proposed method can realize fast high-precision positioning whereas the carrier-smoothed code differential positioning method needs several hundreds of seconds for obtaining high precision results. We can conclude that a relatively high accuracy and high fixing rate can be achieved for triple-frequency WL method with single-epoch observations, displaying significant advantage comparing to traditional carrier-smoothed code differential positioning method.

        "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing systems require accurate, autonomous and real-time orbit determinations (RTOD) for geo-referencing. Onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) has widely been used to undertake such tasks. In this paper, a novel RTOD method achieving decimeter precision using GPS carrier phases, required by China's HY2A and ZY3 missions, is presented. A key to the algorithm success is the introduction of a new parameter, termed pseudo-ambiguity. This parameter combines the phase ambiguity, the orbit, and clock offset errors of the GPS broadcast ephemeris together to absorb a large part of the combined error. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the orbit and clock offset errors, the pseudo-ambiguity can be modeled as a random walk, and estimated in an extended Kalman filter. Experiments of processing real data from HY2A and ZY3, simulating onboard operational scenarios of these two missions, are performed using the developed software SATODS. Results have demonstrated that the position and velocity accuracy (3D RMS) of 0.2-0.4 m and 0.2-0.4 mm/s, respectively, are achieved using dual-frequency carrier phases for HY2A, and slightly worse results for ZY3. These results show it is feasible to obtain orbit accuracy at decimeter level of 3-5 dm for position and 0.3-0.5 mm/s for velocity with this RTOD method. ",

        "abstract": "Improving ambiguity resolution (AR) in multi-frequency undifferenced and uncombined precise point positioning (PPP) benefits from accurate uncalibrated phase delays (UPD), which are often estimated from linear combinations of float ambiguities. The traditional linear ambiguity combinations for estimating these UPDs in case of triple-frequency observations are typically extra-wide-lane, wide-lane, and L1 combinations. We proposed the method for estimating UPDs from triple-frequency ambiguities using maximal decorrelated linear ambiguity combinations obtained by the least-squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment Z-transformation. To validate the quality and availability of estimating UPDs for the BeiDou navigation satellite system, based on maximal decorrelated linear ambiguity combinations, tests using observations from stations of the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China and the Asia-Pacific Reference Frame project are performed using undifferenced and uncombined PPP-AR. The results show the internal precision of combined satellite UPDs estimated from the maximal decorrelated linear ambiguity combinations is better than that estimated from traditional combinations in terms of temporal stability and RMS of posteriori residuals. Furthermore, the statistical results also demonstrated that triple-frequency PPP-AR using the improved UPDs reduces the average convergence time by 8.9 and 12.3% in horizontal and vertical directions, and also improves the positioning accuracy for 3 h of observations by 11.1, 9.1 and 8.3% in the east, north and up directions, respectively, compared with triple-frequency PPP-AR using the UPDs derived from the traditional combinations.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we employ far-field GPS total electron content (TEC) observed in Hawaii to detect the ionospheric disturbances induced by the 2011 Tohoku tsunami. We observed tsunami-driven traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) at two different times: at about 12:40 UT, there were TIDs in the disturbance series propagating at approximately 260\u00a0m/s in an outward direction from the tsunami\u2019s source, and then, the signals began to weaken and gradually disappeared after 14:00 UT; however, at about 17:30 UT, the TIDs appeared again in the disturbance series with similar propagation characteristics. According to the observation times, the former TIDs can be attributed to the straight tsunami from the mainshock, while the latter TIDs are most likely driven by tsunami from aftershocks. Furthermore, we also observed tsunami-like TIDs at about 11:50 UT with similar horizontal velocity and direction compared to tsunami waves. However, the arrival time of the TIDs was about 1.5 earlier than tsunami waves in the sea level and should be induced by other sources.",

        "abstract": "Low-voltage pentacene organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with different gate dielectric interfaces are studied and their performance in terms of electrical properties and operational stability is compared. Overall high electrical performance is demonstrated at low voltage by using a 100 nm-thick high- \u03ba gate dielectric layer of aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and modified with hydroxyl-free low- \u03ba polymers like polystyrene (PS), divinyltetramethyldisiloxane-bis(benzocyclobutene) (BCB) (Cyclotene\u2122, Dow Chemicals), and as well as with the widely used octadecyl-trichlorosilane (OTS). Devices with PS and BCB dielectric surfaces exhibit almost similar electrical performance with high field-effect mobilities, low subthreshold voltages, and high on/off current ratios. The higher mobility in pentacene transistors with PS can be correlated to the better structural ordering of pentacene films, as demonstrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The devices with PS show good electrical stability under bias stress conditions ( V GS = V DS = \u221210 V for 1 h), resulting in a negligible drop (\u223c2%) in saturation current ( I DS ) in comparison to that in devices with OTS (\u223c12%), and to a very high decay (\u223c30%) for the devices with BCB. PACS 85.30.Tv 72.80.Le 77.55.+f 81.15.\u2212z Keywords Pentacene Organic field-effect transistors Operational stability Bias stress effect 1 Introduction The operational stability of OFETs, including hysteresis, reproducibility, reliability, and bias stress (BS) effect, are important issues that need to be addressed for practical applications such as flexible displays and low cost RFIDs. The electrical instability induced by BS effects leads simultaneously to a drain-source current decay and a threshold voltage shift under prolonged operation time with a fixed gate voltage. There exist several potential mechanisms for the electrical instability, which include trapping of charges, defect generation [1] , charge tunneling within the gate dielectrics, at the semiconductor/dielectric interface [2,3] , in the semiconductor itself, or at the interface near the source/drain contacts [4,5] . The current instability has been investigated with different gate dielectric surfaces and the results indicate that SiOH groups and water molecules absorbed on the surface are the main origins of the trap sites [6] . Low- \u03ba polymeric dielectrics have been demonstrated as good dielectric insulators for organic transistors. The device performance of organic transistors was correlated with the dielectric surface energy and the glass transition temperature of the polymers [7\u20139] . However, no polymeric interface providing both high electrical performance and good operational stability for low voltage pentacene p -channel OFETs has yet been identified. In this work, we studied the electrical performance and the operational stability of pentacene organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) in which the gate dielectric is coated with hydroxyl-free low- \u03ba polymers. The polymers chosen for this work were divinyltetramethyldisiloxane-bis(benzocyclobutene) (BCB) (Cyclotene\u2122 3022, Dow Chemicals), and polystyrene (PS) (see chemical structures in Fig. 1 ). Crosslinkable BCB can provide a high-quality hydroxyl-free interface [10] to organic semiconductors with a high dielectric breakdown strength exceeding 3 MV/cm [11] . With poly (\u03b1-methylstyrene) (PMS) as a surface modification layer on gate dielectrics, a record mobility of 7 cm 2 /V s in a thin-film pentacene transistor has been reported [12] . Here, polystyrene (PS) instead of PMS was used due to its lack of dipole moment (such as CH 3 - in PMS). Both BCB and PS have already been demonstrated as stable gate dielectrics for n -channel C 60 OFETs by our group [13] . 2 Experimental details Pentacene transistors were fabricated on heavily n -doped silicon substrates ( n ++ -Si, as the gate electrode) with a 100 nm-thick Al 2 O 3 layer deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a gate dielectric insulator. The process details and dielectric characterization of Al 2 O 3 by ALD are described elsewhere [14] . A top-contact OFET device geometry was used as shown in Fig. 1 . To better control the interfacial properties at the dielectric and the pentacene layer, as well as enhance the device operation stability and reproducibility, the Al 2 O 3 dielectric surface was passivated with different hydroxyl-free polymers (PS and BCB in this work) as thin buffer layers. The thin polymeric layers were formed and processed as follows. The BCB thin films from diluted Cyclotene\u2122 3022 were crosslinked at 250 \u00b0C on a hot plate for 1 h in a N 2 -filled glovebox. PS films were spin-coated from a 4 mg/ml solution in toluene and annealed at 130 \u00b0C on a hot plate for 1 h. The Al 2 O 3 surface was also modified with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with octadecyl-trichlorosilane (OTS) molecules. OTS has been widely known as a good tunneling barrier to hydroxyl groups on oxide surfaces due to its long alkyl chain, and a good surface layer for controlling structural order of pentacene films. OTS layer was formed by soaking the substrates in a 5 mM toluene solution of OTS for 15 h in a dry N 2 -filled glovebox. The capacitance density C OX (nF/cm 2 ) was measured from parallel-plate capacitors with 12 varying contact areas. The added buffer layer on Al 2 O 3 reduced the capacitance density C OX from 66.4 nF/cm 2 to 64.1 nF/cm 2 with OTS, to 46.8 nF/cm 2 with BCB, and to 42.7 nF/cm 2 with PS. The results on C OX are listed in Table 1 and were used to calculate the OFET electrical parameters. Pentacene (Aldrich), purified using gradient zone sublimation, was deposited at a rate of 1 \u00c5/s to a thickness of 50 nm. 60 nm-thick Au as S/D electrodes were deposited at a rate 1 \u00c5/s on top of pentacene through a shadow mask in the same chamber without breaking the vacuum. The substrates were held unheated during the deposition and the chamber vacuum was about 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 Torr. The samples were transferred in a vacuum tight vessel without being exposed to atmospheric conditions into a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2 , H 2 O < 1 ppm) for electrical testing. The electrical measurements were performed using an Agilent E5272A source/monitor unit in the dark. The chemical and physical surface properties of the dielectrics, including surface wetting properties, surface roughness, and surface defect density are important parameters that affect the electrical performance of OFETs, through the morphology/structural ordering of organic semiconductor films and the charge transport at the dielectric/semiconductor interface. To characterize the surface properties, the surface morphology of Al 2 O 3 with different surface modification layers was investigated by AFM (Digital Instruments NanoScope\u2122 Scanning Probe Microscopes). The root-mean-square ( rms ) surface roughness of the dielectric surfaces with different surface treatment was estimated to be below 5 \u00c5 when measured over an area of 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm, as listed in Table 1 . With polymeric surfaces, the dielectric surface roughness of 100 nm-thick Al 2 O 3 was further decreased to below 3 \u00c5 after spin coating. The effect of surface roughness on the charge transport at the interface can be negligible for a rms value smaller than 5 \u00c5 [15,16] . The surface energy of the dielectric surface with different buffering layers was studied by contact angle measurement using DI water, with the results listed in Table 1 . All the surfaces became highly hydrophobic with aqueous contact angles around 90\u00b0, indicating low surface energy with BCB, PS or OTS as passivation layers on the dielectric surface. The morphology of pentacene films can be affected by the deposition conditions (substrate temperature, deposition rate and thickness) as well as the dielectric surface properties (surface roughness, surface energy, and etc). Here, the deposition conditions of pentacene were kept constant. AFM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the film morphology and the structural ordering of pentacene molecules, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . Pentacene films on all dielectric surfaces exhibited high structural order and displayed island formation. However, the grain size varied significantly for the substrates with different surface energy and surface roughness. The morphology of pentacene shows small grains on OTS-treated Al 2 O 3 , probably caused by the large surface roughness of the dielectrics. The pentacene growth on the smoother dielectric surfaces (PS and BCB in this case), on the other hand, was less disturbed and prone to form large grains and good connectivity. The slight difference on the grain size with PS and BCB can be attributed to the different surface energy. The diffraction spectrum of island films consisted of crystalline peaks with a first diffraction peak at 2 \u0398 = 5.74\u00b0, corresponding to \u201cthin film\u201d spacing of 15.4 \u00c5, and the presence of higher order peaks was observed. The lattice spacing corresponds to a tilt of the molecules of 17.1\u00b0 to the surface normal, assuming a triclinic single crystal structure. The presence of a \u201cbulk\u201d phase of pentacene with a spacing of 14.4 \u00c5 was not observed since the substrate temperature was held at room temperature during deposition. The XRD peak intensity mirrored the grain size of the crystalline structure observed in the AFM images; films with larger grains showed higher intensity. 3 Operational stability and electrical characterization In order to accurately characterize the device performance, the devices need to be stable during measurement. Testing procedures like hysteresis scans and duty-cycle-like tests were used to test the stability and reproducibility of the devices. The fabrication and testing were carried-out in a N 2 -filled glove box in the dark so that the device instabilities induced by light, water, and oxygen were avoided. The electrical instability/degradation is attributed to both trapping by shallow and deep states. For deeper trapping sites, longer trapping time/relaxation time is required. The trapping at the shallow sites is usually reversible sometimes even at room temperature. The ratio and distribution of shallow and deep traps are dependent on the materials, fabrication, and device operation. Electrical instability induced by the trapping on different time scales can manifest itself as a hysteresis, a current decay, or a threshold voltage shift. The devices showing hysteresis are less stable, and this property is highly undesirable when the devices are not used as memory devices. The hysteretic transfer characteristics were measured with a resolution of 20 ms and duration of several seconds in the saturation regime with V DS = \u221210 V. The representative transfer curves and normalized output curves ( I DS was normalized by the capacitance density C OX ) are compared in Fig. 3 for the devices with the same geometry (channel length L of 100 \u03bcm and channel width W of 1000 \u03bcm) and different dielectric surface treatments. On the time scale of this measurement, negligible hysteresis and threshold voltage shift were found in transistors with polymeric dielectric surfaces as well as OTS-treated dielectric surfaces. Next, all devices were repeatedly stressed by measuring transfer characteristics in the saturation regime 100 times with a 2 s waiting time between cycles. The superimposed measured transfer curves from the first 10 cycles and the last 10 cycles are shown in Fig. 4 . Here again, no significant performance degradation could be observed in any of the transistors under investigation. The shape of the successive transfer curves remained unchanged during hysteresis scans and during 100 duty-cycle scans, indicating there exists no shallow states from structure defects within the semiconductor or the gate dielectric caused by the applied gate field [17] . In these two types of measurements, the rest time between successive stressing was varied between 20 ms to several seconds and no changes could be observed. We can speculate that either no fast trapping had occurred or that the trapped charges were detrapped/released during the rest time. Negligible threshold voltage shift occurred on this time scale, indicating a good electrical stability and reproducibility for devices under normal operation using Al 2 O 3 gate dielectrics with PS, BCB, and OTS passivation layers. This can be attributed to the low concentration of shallows traps at the dielectric surfaces. Trapping species expected at Al 2 O 3 surfaces, such as highly polar Al(OH) 3 , absorbed water molecules, or other impurities, are screened by the hydroxyl-free polymers used to passivate the surface. With good stability under normal operating conditions, the device performance parameters can be extracted reliably from a forward gate bias scan as seen in Fig. 3 . Field-effect mobilities \u03bc and threshold voltages V T were calculated in the saturation regime defined by standard MOSFET models by fitting the I DS vs. V GS data to the square law. Also extracted from the transfer characteristics are the turn-on voltage ( V TO ) and the on/off current ratio ( I on/off ). The extracted electrical parameters ( \u03bc , V TO , V T , S , and I on/off ) are summarized and compared in Table 1 along with rms and C OX previously measured. Devices with PS and BCB dielectric surfaces show similar electrical performance with high mobility, low subthreshold voltage, and high on/off current ratios. The higher mobility from pentacene transistors on PS can be correlated to the structural ordering of pentacene films: larger grains, higher XRD intensity and less trapping. Since OTS might not fully passivate the Al(OH) 3 groups on the surface, these electron-trapping residuals could give rise to an earlier turn-on voltage and lower threshold voltages in pentacene OFETs with OTS. To investigate the dependence of mobility on the channel length L , field-effect mobilities of devices are statistically plotted over the inverse of channel length ( L \u22121 ) with a channel width W = 1000 \u03bcm in Fig. 5 a. All the devices with different dielectric surfaces show a similar trend: the mobility remains nearly independent of channel length larger than 25 \u03bcm. However, the device mobility with short channels of 25 \u03bcm increases instead of decreasing like in many organic transistors where the channel current is contact-limited due to the large Schottky barrier at the metal/organic interface. The higher mobilities at short-channel devices could be explained through the presence of fewer traps in the grain boundaries existing within a shorter length. It also implies a very low contact resistance and good ohmic contact between Au S/D electrode and pentacene films. To gain a better understanding of the effect of the contacts on the mobility, the contact resistance of pentacene transistors with PS as a surface treatment layer was extracted using the transmission line method (TLM) based on the dependence of current\u2013voltage characteristics on channel length. In the linear regime, the overall device resistance R on can be considered as the sum of the channel resistance R ch and a total contact resistance R C according to Rolland [18] . A set of devices with channel lengths ranging from L = 50 to 200 \u03bcm and a fixed channel width of W = 1000 \u03bcm was used to calculate the contact resistance at a low drain-source voltage ( V DS ) of \u22120.1 V for V GS values ranging from \u22123 to \u221210 V. The width-normalized contact resistance ( R C W ) was estimated using the y intercept of the least squares when extrapolating R on W to L = 0 \u03bcm, as plotted in Fig. 5 b. The contact resistance drops drastically with V GS since the resistance of pentacene film was reduced by the increasingly induced charge density in the accumulation regime with V GS . A low R C W of 500 \u03a9 cm was achieved at V GS = \u221210 V. This value is even lower than the best result reported by Klauk et al. [19] . Since the contact resistance between the Au S/D electrodes and pentacene films is quite low and the values are similar for the devices with different dielectric surfaces, its change during the operation can be negligible compared to that of the channel resistance with a long channel length such as L = 100 \u03bcm. Therefore, the effect of contact resistance on the electrical stability can be ignored in this study. 4 Bias stress effect To further explore the effect of different dielectric interfaces on the stability of pentacene transistors, the time-dependent decay of I DS was tested under dc bias stress with V GS = V DS = \u221210 V for 1 h, as plotted in Fig. 6 a. The current decay in this experiment exhibited typical features of bias stress instability showing an exponential decay function. The trapping rate slows down with stressing time since the density of the vacant trapping sites decreases as more holes are trapped with time. Then, trapped charges screen the electrical field and in turn cause the negative shift of the threshold voltage. The bias stress instability can be described by a stretched-exponential function based on threshold voltage shift ( \u0394 V T ) or drain-source channel current decay. A stretched-exponential equation was proposed by Libsch and Kanicki based on \u0394 V T [20] : (1) \u0394 V T ( t ) = V GS - V TO 1 - exp - t \u03c4 \u03b2 . V GS - V TO is the effective voltage drop across the gate insulator and V TO is the initial threshold voltage at t = 0 s. The dispersion parameter \u03b2 is the stretched-exponential factor, reflecting the width of the involved trap distribution. The constant \u03c4 represents the characteristic trapping time of the carriers. The trapping/detrapping process is assumed thermally activated. The above model can be extended with the measurement of drain-source channel on-current decay with time under dc bias stress [21] . Using on-current degradation instead of threshold voltage shift to estimate stability can avoid the error and inaccuracy caused by the measurement and extraction of threshold voltages. The derivation of stretched-exponential function based on on-current degradation was carried-out as follows. The current\u2013voltage characteristics in the saturation regime can be described as: (2) I DS = 1 2 \u03bc C OX W L V GS - V TO 2 = K V GS - V TO 2 . When the device has been operated for a long period of time t that resulted in a threshold voltage shift \u0394 V T , the current\u2013voltage characteristics after an elapsed time t can be expressed as: (3) I DS ( t ) = K V GS - ( V TO + \u0394 V T ( t ) ) 2 . Then, the current decay with time \u0394 I DS ( t ) can be described as: (4) \u0394 I DS ( t ) = I DS ( t ) I DS 0 = [ V GS - ( V TO + \u0394 V T ( t ) ) ] 2 ( V GS - V TO ) 2 . Combining a stretched-exponential function for \u0394 V T from Eq. (1) , a stretched-exponential function for \u0394 I DS ( t ) can be reduced to: (5) \u0394 I DS ( t ) = I DS ( t ) I DS 0 = exp - 1 t \u03c4 \u03b2 As shown in Fig. 6 a, the solid points are the experimental data and the line is a fit according to Eq. (5) . The simulated results indicate that the experimental data can be fitted with Eq. (5) where the on current in the channel was obtained in the saturation regime. The threshold voltage shift under the same condition can be calculated from Eq. (1) using the fitting parameters listed in Table 1 , as shown in Fig. 6 b. The dispersion parameter \u03b2 , reflecting the width of the involved trap distribution, is similar (0.41\u20130.42) in the devices with polymeric interfaces and SAM. The values are similar to the value obtained by Mathijssen [3,22] using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) SAM to passivate the dielectric surface. The \u03b2 value was found to be lower with higher HMDS coverage [3] . The stability during dc bias stress can be quantitatively compared with the trapping time \u03c4 at room temperature. Longer times \u03c4 are desirable because they lead to transistors with smaller threshold voltage shifts and increased stability. Since polar Al(OH) 3 groups can acts as traps, the presence of a spatial barrier between the mobile charge carriers and the traps results in a much longer time scale for the threshold voltage shift dynamics. Therefore, the stability of the devices with treated dielectric surfaces (PS, BCB or OTS SAM) was improved with values for \u03c4 in the range of 10 5 \u201310 8 s, with small \u0394 V T below 1 V. Among them, pentacene OFETs with a PS-treated gate dielectric surface show the highest stability with the trapping time even longer than that of amorphous Si thin film transistors (TFTs) [23] . Pentacene transistors passivated with PS exhibit an outstanding stability with estimated \u0394 V T of 0.2 V after 3600 s stressed under dc bias with V GS = V DS = \u221210 V based on the values of \u03b2 and \u03c4 extracted by fitting the current decay. Devices with OTS-treated surfaces also show good stability with time constants in the range of 10 6 \u201310 7 s, which agrees well with the results reported by Miyadera using \u03b2 -phenethyltrichlorosilane SAM [24] . We notice that the stability with BCB-treated gate dielectrics in pentacene OFETs is poorer than that of devices with PS or OTS SAM. This observation is in contrast with the results obtained in n -channel C 60 OFETs where devices with BCB-treated gate dielectrics were found to be most stable [13] . Hence, there is a fundamental difference in the trapping mechanisms giving rise to the degradation of the electrical performance of C 60 and pentacene-based OFETs with BCB-treated gate dielectrics. The non-polar nature of BCB seems to rule out a dipolar origin to the trapping mechanisms occurring in pentacene OFETs, therefore further investigation is required to explore the origin of this slow trapping mechanism. It is worth pointing out that in C 60 OFETs, passivation of the gate dielectric with PS acted almost as effectively as BCB to stabilize the electrical performance. Therefore, the results presented in this paper also indicate that PS offers a good compromise to achieve stable operation both in C 60 and pentacene OFETs. Indeed, with PS as the gate dielectric passivation layer, organic complementary inverters with high noise margins and dc gains have been demonstrated recently [25] . The characteristic trapping time \u03c4 (10 5 \u201310 8 ) is several orders of magnitude longer than the time duration for hysteresis and repeatability (10 \u22123 \u201310 s) testing. In other words, when the devices experienced short-time stress, no bias stress effect was introduced. To further investigate the trap distribution and the activation energy of traps, the measurement of current decay at various thermal temperatures is required. This model is able to predict the threshold shift behavior for any time duration. However, this model only addresses the electrical stress with dc bias. In AMLCD, a-Si:H TFTs are subjected to pulsed gate bias addressing with a typical frequency of 60 Hz [26] . The magnitude of threshold voltage shift caused by ac stress or pulsed gate bias is significantly lower. A logical explanation is that the trapped charges at the shallow states will be released if the rest time between the testing is longer than the trapping time. 5 Conclusion We studied the device performance and operational stability of pentacene OFETs in which the gate dielectric was passivated by PS and BCB polymers or by OTS. The device performance was found to correlate with the structural ordering of pentacene films and the surface properties of gate dielectrics. Both PS and BCB passivation can yield devices with high charge mobility due to the formation of pentacene films with large grain size on the smooth surface with low surface energy. However, when measured under prolonged dc gate bias, the electrical performance of devices with BCB deteriorated. The stability of devices with OTS was found superior but the best overall performance was obtained in devices passivated with PS.

PACS 85.30.Tv 72.80.Le 77.55.+f 81.15.\u2212z Keywords Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) Atomic layer deposition (ALD) Al 2 O 3 Pentacene ITO 1 Introduction Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have recently gained attention as building blocks for electronic applications that can greatly benefit from low-cost, large-area fabrication and flexible form factors, such as radio-frequency identification tags (RFID) [1] , drivers for electronic paper [2] and driving circuits for flat panel displays (FPDs) [3] . To achieve high-performance OFETs, development of suitable gate dielectric materials in addition to high-mobility organic semiconductors is important. Preferably, dielectric materials should have a high dielectric constant ( \u03ba ) and should be processible into thin high-quality, defect-free films to form OFETs with a reduced operating voltage, fast switching speed, and large on/off ratio. Low deposition temperature is also desirable to allow for fabrication on plastic substrates. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a deposition technique that allows for the deposition of highly conformal, defect-free dielectric layers at relatively low temperature [4\u20137] . Dielectric films grown by ALD have a high resistivity and good barrier properties, and therefore are excellent candidates for gate insulators. The deposition process is simple, low-cost, and compatible with various substrates made from different materials and with irregular shapes [4,5] . Oxide layers fabricated by ALD have also been studied as O 2 /H 2 O barriers for organic light-emitting diodes [8] . However, to date ALD technology has had limited success in fabricating dielectric materials suitable for OFET applications [9,10] . Here, we report on the fabrication of high-performance pentacene OFET devices using a 200 nm-thick film of Al 2 O 3 grown by ALD as the gate dielectric material. We first characterized the dielectric and the surface properties of Al 2 O 3 thin films grown by ALD. We then fabricated OFETs on heavily n -doped silicon ( n + -Si) substrates (serving also as the gate electrode) with both, 200 nm-thick films of Al 2 O 3 grown by ALD and thermally-grown SiO 2 , as the gate dielectrics. The latter was used as a reference control sample. Finally, we used the conformational aspect of ALD to fabricate high-performance OFETs on a substrate with a large surface roughness: ITO-coated glass substrate. 2 Deposition and characterization of Al 2 O 3 gate insulators A Savannah100 ALD system from Cambridge Nanotech Inc. was used to deposit Al 2 O 3 dielectric films on n + -Si substrates (5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u03a9 cm) and on ITO-coated glass substrates (Colorado Concept Coatings, 60 \u03a9/sq.). ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using, successively, soapy water, deionized water, acetone, and reagent alcohol for 15 min each, and then dried under nitrogen. The n + -Si substrates were cleaned in a mixture of H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O 2 , and a buffered oxide etchant (1:6 diluted HF in H 2 O) was used to remove the natural oxide. Immediately before being loaded into the ALD deposition system, substrates underwent O 2 plasma treatment in a plasma asher for 10 min at low power. This plasma treatment is known, not only to remove organic residues and other contaminants from surfaces, but also to increase the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups and the amount of absorbed aluminum precursor [11] . Al 2 O 3 films were deposited at 100 \u00b0C using alternating exposures of Al(CH 3 ) 3 and H 2 O vapor at a deposition rate of approximately 1 \u00c5 per cycle. Each deposition cycle (one monolayer) lasted 24 s, yielding a total deposition time of 13.3 h for 2000 cycles. The thickness of the Al 2 O 3 films was measured by a stylus profilometer (Dektak 6M by Veeco) and found to be about 200 nm. We characterized the dielectric properties of Al 2 O 3 films (200 nm) grown on ITO-coated glass using parallel plate capacitors of various plate areas ranging from 3.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm 2 to 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22121 cm 2 . The capacitors were fabricated by sandwiching a 200 nm-thick Al 2 O 3 film between an ITO electrode and a 100 nm-thick Al electrode. For each of the 12 devices, capacitance and dissipation factor (loss tangent) were measured at 1.0 V RMS as a function of frequency from 20 Hz to 1 MHz with an Agilent 4284A precision LCR meter. The dielectric constant ( \u03ba ) of Al 2 O 3 at 1 kHz was determined to be 7.5 \u00b1 0.2 (calculated from the linear dependence of capacitance as a function of device area C OX = \u03b5 o k / t , where \u03b5 o is the permittivity in vacuum, t is the thickness, and \u03ba is the dielectric constant). This result is comparable to the value obtained by Groner [5] . The current density vs. voltage characteristic presented in Fig. 1 a shows that a 200 nm-thick Al 2 O 3 film is an excellent insulator with a leakage current density less than 200 nA/cm 2 under an applied field of 2 MV/cm over a contact area of 0.016 cm 2 . Notably, these values are small considering the large surface roughness of ITO-coated glass. Dissipation factors for all devices were measured in the range of 10 \u22123 . Furthermore, the capacitance density C OX was stable up to a relatively high frequency of 1 MHz, as shown in Fig. 1 b. In addition to dielectric properties, the chemical and physical surface properties of dielectrics including surface wetting properties, surface roughness, and surface defect density are also important parameters that affect the electrical performance of OFETs, through the morphology/structural ordering of organic semiconductor films and the charge transport at the dielectric/semiconductor interface. To characterize the surface properties, first, an element analysis of Al 2 O 3 films was done by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). No other elements other than Al, O, and elements from the substrates (e.g., Si, In, and Sn) were detected over a test area of 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm. Then, the surface morphology of Al 2 O 3 on both n + -Si substrates (smooth) and on ITO-coated glass (rough) was investigated by AFM (Digital Instruments NanoScope \u2122 Scanning Probe Microscopes). The results were compared with thermally-grown SiO 2 on n + -Si substrates as shown in Fig. 2 . The root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of the 200 nm-thick Al 2 O 3 film on an n + -Si substrate was estimated to be 4.3 \u00c5 when measured over an area of 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm ( Fig. 2 left), which is almost identical to that of the 200 nm-thick SiO 2 film thermally-grown on an identical n + -Si substrate 4 \u00c5 ( Fig. 2 center). With an ITO-coated glass substrate, the RMS surface roughness of a 200 nm-thick film of Al 2 O 3 was increased up to 12 \u00c5 ( Fig. 2 right), which is comparable to the value of the substrate prior to deposition. So far, we have obtained high-quality Al 2 O 3 dielectric insulators with a dielectric constant ( \u03ba = 7.5) almost twice that of SiO 2 . Although, high- \u03ba dielectric insulators are desirable for reducing operating voltage of OFETs, Veres et al. have reported that high- \u03ba dielectrics usually contain polar functional groups that can increase the energetic disorder at the interface, which results in a higher localization of the charge carriers and reduced field-effect mobility in polymer OFETs [12,13] . Recent studies based on organic single-crystal transistors have attributed the dependence of mobility on dielectric polarizability to the coupling/interaction force between the charged carriers in the organic conducting channel and the ionic lattice of the dielectric [14,15] . To minimize the effect of dielectric polar functional groups and other surface charges on the organic conducting channel, the surfaces of all oxides were passivated with an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) just before the deposition of pentacene. It is well established that SAMs applied on the interfaces in OFETs allow for better control of the morphology and properties of the organic semiconducting material. The OTS SAMs were formed by dipping the substrates in a 5 mM toluene solution of OTS for 30 min after the substrates were oxygen-plasma treated for two minutes. The static aqueous contact angle measurement showed that after the treatment, the previously hydrophilic surfaces of both dielectric materials became hydrophobic. A contact angle of 91\u201392\u00b0 was obtained from OTS-treated Al 2 O 3 on both smooth surface ( n + -Si) and rough surface (ITO-coated glass), indicating that a uniform self-assembled OTS monolayer with long alkyl chains was formed. This value is slightly lower than that of OTS-treated SiO 2 on n + -Si (112\u00b0). This can be attributed to a lower concentration of oxygen atoms of Al 2 O 3 and a different SAM formation mechanism compared with SiO 2 [16,17] . 3 Fabrication and characterization of OFETs with Al 2 O 3 gate insulators OFETs were fabricated using 200 nm-thick Al 2 O 3 on n + -Si (T1), 200 nm-thick SiO 2 on n + -Si (T2, the reference sample), and 200 nm-thick Al 2 O 3 on ITO-coated glass (T3). All oxide surfaces were treated with OTS SAMs as described above and n + -Si and ITO acted as gate electrodes, respectively. All three types of transistors were top-contact devices (as shown in Fig. 3 a for T1 and T2, and Fig. 3 b for T3). The transistors were fabricated by evaporating a 60 nm-thick film of pentacene on different substrates (T1, T2, and T3) followed by the patterned deposition of a 40 nm-thick Au film capped with a 100 nm-thick Al film to serve as top source/drain electrodes through a shadow mask. Here, a thin Au film was inserted to form a quasi-ohmic contact between pentacene and the source/drain electrodes. Ti/Au (10 nm/100 nm) backside metallization was used as the external gate contact in T1 and T2. Prior to deposition, pentacene (Aldrich) was purified using gradient zone sublimation, and then deposited at a deposition rate of 0.3 \u00c5/s, as measured by a crystal monitor. The temperature and pressure during deposition were 25 \u00b0C and 2 \u00d7 10 \u22128 Torr, respectively. The samples were transferred in a vacuum-tight vessel without being exposed to atmospheric conditions into a nitrogen glove box (O 2 , H 2 O < 0.1 ppm) for electrical testing. The electrical measurements were performed using an Agilent E5272A source/monitor unit in a dark environment. The surface morphology of the pentacene films on different substrates (T1, T2, and T3) was characterized using AFM as shown in Fig. 4 . The growth of pentacene films on all three OTS-treated substrates exhibited high structural order and displayed island formation, but no dendrite-like crystal formation was observed. However, the grain size greatly varied from the substrates with different surface energy and surface roughness. Therefore, although the RMS roughness on T1 and T2 are comparable (see Fig. 2 ), the grain size was slightly reduced on T1 where its aqueous contact angle is lower. A further reduction in grain size can be seen in T3 due to its larger roughness (12 \u00c5) compared to T1 and T2 [18,19] . The larger grain size of pentacene films on T2 may be due to the residual polar groups on SiO 2 , like silanols [20] . Intermolecular layer spacing of pentacene films was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 5 , the diffraction spectrum of island films consisted of crystalline peaks with a first diffraction peak at 2 \u0398 = 5.74\u00b0, corresponding to \u201cthin film\u201d spacing of 15.4 \u00c5, and the presence of higher order peaks (up to 4 or 5) was observed on the smooth substrates (T1, T2). The lattice spacing corresponds to a tilt of the molecules of 17.1\u00b0 to the surface normal, assuming a triclinic single-crystal structure. The presence of a \u201cbulk\u201d phase of pentacene with a spacing of 14.4 \u00c5 was not observed for films reported here. Peak intensity and number of higher-order reflections mirrored the grain size of the crystalline structure observed in AFM images: films with larger grains showed higher intensity and more higher-order reflections. With smaller crystalline grain size ( Fig. 4 ), the peak intensity of T1 was slightly lower than that for T2. In comparison, the grain size was reduced and then the peak intensity was decreased in T3 due to its large substrate surface roughness, as discussed by Steudel [18] and Fritz [19] . Pentacene transistors were characterized in the saturation regime defined by standard MOSFET models. To explore the influence of the different dielectrics (Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 ) on device performance, transistors T1 and T2 with a channel length L = 65 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm and a channel width W = 590 \u00b1 90 \u03bcm were compared. These two types of transistors had similar properties such as substrate surface roughness, pentacene morphology, and structural ordering as discussed earlier. Fig. 6 shows the output characteristics in Fig. 6 a (drain-source current I DS vs. drain-source voltage V DS for increasing values of gate-source voltage V GS ) and transfer characteristics in Fig. 6 b (\u2212 I DS vs. V GS plotted on a logarithmic scale and \u2223 I DS \u2223 vs. V GS , at V DS = \u221230 V) for the two transistors. Field-effect mobilities and threshold voltages were calculated in the saturation regime by fitting the \u2223 I DS \u2223 vs. V GS data to the square law: (1) I DS = \u03bc C OX W 2 L ( V GS - V T ) 2 where \u03bc is the field-effect mobility, C OX is the capacitance density of the gate dielectric insulator, V T is the threshold voltage, and W (width) and L (length) are the dimensions of the semiconductor channel defined by the source and drain electrodes. A field-effect mobility of 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 cm 2 /V s was extracted for the T1 transistors while the T2 transistors had a lower carrier mobility of 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 cm 2 /V s. With Al 2 O 3 ( \u03ba = 7.5) as gate insulators, the capacitance density of the gate insulator in T1 transistors was as high as 32.7 nF/cm 2 as compared to 17.3 nF/cm 2 in T2 transistors. Consequently, the saturation current (\u221288 \u03bcA) in T1 transistors was almost five times larger than that (\u221217 \u03bcA) obtained from T2 transistors as shown in Fig. 6 a. The higher mobility and current obtained from T1 transistors can be correlated with the morphology of pentacene film and the dielectric/surface properties of OTS-treated Al 2 O 3 : first, compared with pentacene films on T2 (OTS-treated SiO 2 ), a reduced grain size and a well-ordered island formation of pentacene films on OTS-treated Al 2 O 3 (T1) indicate a higher interconnection and tighter packing (with improved contact) between grains, which could lead to more efficient charge transport and enhance the drain current in the channel [21] . Secondly, with OTS SAMs on the surface, the surface disorder induced by the polar groups from high- \u03ba dielectric surface (Al 2 O 3 in our case) can be minimized. This is confirmed by the zero turn-on voltage V TO shown on the transfer curve in Fig. 6 b, indicating that no net fixed charges exist at the semiconductor/insulator interface. By using gate insulators with higher dielectric constant, a higher concentration of the charge carriers is accumulated in the channel for the same gate voltage and the Fermi level moves towards the band edge. The trapping states located in the \u2018gap\u2019 are filled and consequently a higher density of injected carriers is free to move with the microscopic mobility associated with carriers in the delocalized states. Thus, the use of high- \u03ba dielectrics not only lowers the operating voltage, but also improves the mobility. This increase in mobility can be superlinear, as observed in this study, since it is due to the cumulative process of carriers becoming available at higher energies as the lower energy traps are filled. Using dielectric films with comparable thickness but having different dielectric constants, Dimitrakopolous et al. have demonstrated that the mechanism responsible for enhancing TFT carrier mobility is related to the carrier density in the channel region rather than the gate electric field [22] . Along with a zero turn-on voltage V TO , a low threshold voltage of \u22127 \u00b1 2 V and a subthreshold slope of 0.6 V/decade were extracted for T1. A high on/off current ratio of 6 \u00d7 10 6 was also obtained for T1, measured between the \u201con\u201d current value at V GS = \u221230 V and the \u201coff\u201d current at V GS = 0 V, both with V DS = \u221230 V. On the other hand, T2 showed a positive turn-on voltage V TO of 5 V with a threshold voltage of \u22129 \u00b1 2 V. Thus the transistors were operated in the depletion mode instead of the enhancement mode as in T1, and consequently they could only be switched off by applying a positive gate bias. In addition, a higher sub-threshold slope of 3 V/decade and a lower on/off ratio of 10 5 were obtained for T2. The \u201coff\u201d current in T2 was 10 times higher than that in T1. These significant improvements in subthreshold slope, turn-on voltage (threshold voltage) and \u201coff\u201d current seen in T1 transistors can be attributed to a lower charge trap density at the pentacene/dielectric interface. We can estimate the maximum interfacial trap density N trap max from Eq. (2) : [23,24] (2) N trap max = C OX q qS log e k B T - 1 where k B is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, T is temperature, q is the electronic charge, e is the base of the natural logarithm, C OX is the capacitance density of the gate insulator and S is the subthreshold slope in V/decade. Calculated from Eq. (2) , the trap density at the OTS-treated Al 2 O 3 (T1) surface was as low as 1.8 \u00d7 10 12 cm \u22122 . A much higher value of trap density (5.2 \u00d7 10 12 cm \u22122 ) was obtained from OTS-treated SiO 2 (T2) surface. This higher value can explain the positive turn-on voltage, larger subthreshold slope, and higher \u201coff\u201d current observed in T2. However, this calculated trap density value for OTS-treated SiO 2 is comparable to previously reported values for bare SiO 2 [23] . The interfacial traps are usually due to surface imperfections such as oxygen (OH groups), water molecules or mobile ions. It has been shown that silanol groups on SiO 2 cannot be completely passivated by self-assembled alkyl layers [25] . The residual silanol groups can trap electrons with protons and release H 2 , therefore forming negative charges and inducing a positive shift in V TO [20] . The electrical parameters we discussed here for transistors T1 and T2 along with those of the transistors T3 to be discussed next are summarized in Table 1 . The output characteristics and transfer characteristics of T3 transistors were shown in Figs. 7a and 7 b, respectively. Even though the substrate ITO-coated glass had a relatively large surface roughness (see Fig. 2 ), a high field-effect mobility of 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 cm 2 /V s was obtained in the saturation region for T3 ( Fig. 7 b) with a channel length L = 185 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm and a channel width W = 550 \u00b1 50 \u03bcm. This value of mobility ranks to date as the highest known mobility reported for pentacene-based OFETs on ITO-coated glass [26] . This indicates that the contribution of higher carrier density to the field-effect mobility is dominant compared to the adverse effect of the substrate roughness on the morphology and transport. In addition to the high-mobility values, T3 transistors exhibited superior electrical characteristics similar to those of T1: a turn-on voltage V TO of zero volts, a threshold voltage of \u22126 \u00b1 1 V, and a subthreshold slope of 0.5 V/decade, as extracted from the transfer characteristic curve ( Fig. 7 b). The maximum trap density was estimated to be 1.4 \u00d7 10 12 cm \u22122 , which is again close to the value estimated for T1. The consistency of trap density across the same type of oxide surface further confirms that Al 2 O 3 has fewer trapping sites. A high on/off current ratio larger than 10 6 was also obtained from T3. Since pentacene growth, and thus OFETs made of it, can be affected by the roughness of dielectric layers underneath as demonstrated by Fritz et al. [19] , the high performance of T3 transistors demonstrates the effectiveness of employing an Al 2 O 3 layer grown by ALD technique as a dielectric for inherently rough substrates. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have utilized atomic layer deposition (ALD) to grow Al 2 O 3 gate dielectric insulators and obtained high-performance pentacene OFETs. OFETs fabricated on n + -Si wafers and ITO-coated glass were operated in enhancement mode with a zero turn-on voltage, and exhibited large carrier mobility and a low threshold voltage, as well as a low subthreshold slope and a large on/off current ratio. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of pentacene films on Al 2 O 3 revealed well-ordered island formation, and X-ray diffraction patterns showed characteristics of a \u201cthin film\u201d phase. Low trap density and high capacitance density of Al 2 O 3 gate insulators also contributed to the high performance of pentacene field-effect transistors. The results of this work not only demonstrate that gate dielectrics grown by ALD present a viable alternative to dielectrics from traditional deposition techniques, but also show that the ALD dielectrics can result in improved electrical performance of transistors even on substrates with high roughness. The latter will become an increasingly critical issue in future for most flexible substrates of interest.

        "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in the area of p-type organic field effect transistors while progress in developing n-type materials and devices has been comparatively lacking, a limiting factor in the pursuit to develop complementary organic electronic circuits. Given the need for n-type organic semiconductors we have carried out studies using two different fullerene molecules, C 60 and C 70 . Here, we report mobilities for C 60 ranging from 0.02 cm 2 /V s up to 0.65 cm 2 /V s (depending on channel length), and mobilities from 0.003 cm 2 /V s up to 0.066 cm 2 /V s for C 70 . All devices were fabricated with organic films deposited under high vacuum but tested at ambient pressures under nitrogen. PACS 85.30.Tv 85.65.+h 73.61.Wp Keywords Organic electronics Complementary logic Thin-film transistors Fullerenes 1 Introduction Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) hold promise for electronic applications where low cost, large area, simplified processing and mechanical flexibility are of interest. Individual transistors with field-effect mobilities greater than 1 cm 2 /V s, threshold voltages near 0 V, and on/off current ratios greater than 10 6 are routinely achieved in thin films of the p-type (hole transport) organic semiconductor pentacene [1] . This level of performance is comparable to that of amorphous silicon thin-film transistors used to drive some liquid\u2013crystal displays. However, in order to realize applications such as organic complementary logic circuits [2] , both p-type and n-type organic semiconductors are needed and should exhibit comparable electrical performance. In contrast, electron field-effect mobilities have only recently exceeded 1 cm 2 /V s; where the highest value reported in a thin-film device was 1.7 cm 2 /V s using the perylene-based compound PTCDI-C 8 [3] . The fullerenes are another well known class of n-type organic semiconductor that have previously been used for OFETs. In thin films of the fullerene C 60 , reported field-effect mobility values have increased over time from 0.08 cm 2 /V s, reported by Haddon et al. [4] to 0.56 cm 2 /V s, reported by Kobayashi et al. [5,6] . In both cases threshold voltages were approximately 15\u201320 V, and on/off current ratios increased from >10 6 for Haddon to >10 8 for Kobayashi. Thin films of the fullerene C 70 have also been studied in OFET devices by Haddon [7] and the field effect mobility was two orders of magnitude lower than C 60 , 0.002 cm 2 /V s. Compared to Haddon\u2019s C 60 OFETs, these devices also exhibited higher threshold voltages (27 V compared to 15 V) and on\u2013off current ratios that were one order of magnitude lower (10 5 compared to 10 6 ). Because n-type organic semiconductors are susceptible to the effects of oxygen [8] , fullerene devices exhibiting the highest mobility values [4\u20137] have been both fabricated and tested under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. One report of stable operation of C 60 OFETs in air used an Ar sputtered, low oxygen content alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) passivation layer that resulted in no degradation in transistor performance for more than one month but the mobility was only 0.1 cm 2 /V s [9] . Here, we present results on thin-film C 60 and C 70 OFETs fabricated under high vacuum and tested in nitrogen at ambient pressure. These devices exhibit electron field-effect mobilities as high as 0.65 cm 2 /V s in C 60 and 0.066 cm 2 /V s in C 70 . 2 Experiment Transistors were fabricated on heavily n-doped silicon substrates (as the gate electrode) with 200 nm of thermally grown silicon dioxide as the gate dielectric ( \u03b5 r = 3.9) and Ti/Au (10 nm/100 nm) backside metalization as the external gate contact. Bottom contact geometry Ti/Au (10 nm/100 nm) source and drain electrodes defining channels with 500 \u03bcm and 1000 \u03bcm widths and lengths ranging from 1 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm were patterned on the SiO 2 layer using lift-off photolithography ( Fig. 1 ). Commercially obtained (Alfa Aesar) C 60 and C 70 were first purified using gradient zone sublimation and then deposited at 0.6 \u00c5/s onto the source and drain electrodes to a thickness of 50 nm. Depositions were performed at room temperature using physical vapor deposition at a pressure of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 Torr. Subsequent to organic layer deposition the devices were transferred into a nitrogen glove box (O 2 , H 2 O < 1 ppm) connected to the vacuum deposition system and then transferred in an air-tight vessel to a second glove box filled with nitrogen (O 2 , H 2 O < 0.1 ppm) for electrical characterization. During testing electrical connections were made with a micro-probe station contained within the second glove box and an Agilent E5272A medium power source/monitor unit, connected to the probe station, was used to perform the electrical measurements. At no point after deposition of the organic layer were the devices exposed to air. For each individual device output characteristics ( I DS vs. V DS at multiple, discrete V GS values) and transfer characteristics ( I DS vs. V GS at fixed V DS ) were measured. Field-effect mobilities and threshold voltages were calculated in the saturation regime by fitting the I DS vs. V GS data to the square law: (1) I DS = \u03bc C OX W 2 L ( V GS - V T ) 2 where \u03bc is the field-effect mobility, C OX is the capacitance density of the gate dielectric [F/cm 2 ], V T is the threshold voltage, and W (width) and L (length) are the dimensions of the semiconductor channel defined by the source and drain electrodes. 3 Results For the C 60 OFETs mobility values generally increased with channel length and ranged from a minimum of 0.02 cm 2 /V s for the width 1000 \u03bcm, length 1 \u03bcm device to the maximum value of 0.65 cm 2 /V s for the width 500 \u03bcm, length 50 \u03bcm device ( Fig. 2 ). This field effect mobility value is greater than the 0.56 cm 2 /V s value reported by Kobayashi et al. [5,6] and, more recently, the 0.5 cm 2 /V s value reported by Tapponnier et al. [10] , for devices fabricated and tested under UHV. Transfer characteristics for this device are shown in Fig. 3 b. In addition to the mobility value, the linear fit to the I DS vs. V GS data yielded a threshold voltage of approximately 32 V. Semi-logarithmic plots of I DS vs. V GS yielded an on/off current ratio >10 6 and a sub-threshold slope of 3.2 V/decade. Output characteristics for the width 500 \u03bcm, length 50 \u03bcm device are shown in Fig. 3 a for V DS between 0 V and 60 V and V GS between 0 V and 60 V. Results for the C 70 OFETs behaved similarly to those of C 60 where mobility values increased with channel length and ranged from a minimum of 0.003 cm 2 /V s for the width 500 \u03bcm, length 1 \u03bcm device to the maximum value of 0.066 cm 2 /V s for the width 500 \u03bcm, length 50 \u03bcm device ( Fig. 2 ). This field-effect mobility value is more than 30 times the 0.002 cm 2 /V s value reported by Haddon et al. for devices fabricated and tested under UHV [7] . Transfer characteristics for this device are shown in Fig. 4 b. The linear fit to the I DS vs. V GS data yielded a higher threshold voltage of approximately 40 V and semilogarithmic plots of I DS vs. V GS yielded an on/off current ratio >10 5 . The lower mobility and higher threshold voltage in C 70 reflect the same trend observed by Haddon. C 70 however, did exhibit a lower sub-threshold slope of 2.2 V/decade. Output characteristics for the width 500 \u03bcm, length 50 \u03bcm C 70 OFET are shown in Fig. 4 a for V DS between 0 V and 60 V and V GS between 0 V and 60 V. One significant difference in the performance of the two materials is the non-ohmic behavior in the output characteristics at low V DS in the C 60 device compared to the C 70 device. Such behavior suggests the presence of contact resistance between the organic semiconductor and the source and drain electrodes. While contact resistance can be attributed to many factors including film morphology at the electrode/organic interface [11] and interactions between the electrode and organic semiconductor [12] it is difficult to determine an absolute cause for the non-ohmic behavior in our devices. However, bottom contact Ti/Au electrodes have shown in the literature to produce more ohmic output characteristics that what we have presented here [6] . Common to both materials is a decrease in the drain current in the usual saturation regime above pinch-off. This phenomenon is as of yet unexplained but it has been observed in other n-type organic field-effect transistors [13] . Our devices were also sensitive to ambient atmosphere exposure. When C 60 devices similar to those discussed previously were exposed to ambient atmosphere for 1 h and then returned to the glove box for testing, drain currents were found to drop by half ( Fig. 5 b) relative to those measured in the pristine state ( Fig. 5 a). This was accompanied by a drop in mobility and on/off current ratio as well as an increase in threshold voltage ( Table 1 ). Similar to other reports in the literature [8,10] , post-exposure device performance (drain current, mobility, threshold voltage, on/off current ratio) could be improved by storing the devices in the inert atmosphere for 24 h prior to retesting ( Fig. 5 c, Table 1 ). Compared to pristine devices ( Fig. 6 a), C 70 OFETs showed a factor of three reduction in drain currents after a 1 h exposure to ambient atmosphere ( Fig. 6 b) along with a decrease in mobility and on/off current ratio and an increase in threshold voltage ( Table 1 ). Unlike the C 60 device however, performance continued to degrade after storage under inert atmosphere for 24 h ( Fig. 6 c, Table 1 ). Another point of interest regarding our results on C 60 is that the mobility value of 0.65 cm 2 /V s is slightly higher than the highest mobility measured in single crystals of C 60 (0.5 cm 2 /V s) by the time-of-flight technique [14] . Material morphology plays a significant role in charge transport and mobility measurements in organic single crystals are usually considered upper values. For instance, recent work has shown that hole mobilities as large as 35 cm 2 /V s could be measured in single crystals of pentacene as measured by space-charge limited current methods [15] . These values should be compared with hole mobilities of 5 cm 2 /V s measured in thin films of pentacene in a field-effect transistor geometry [16] . Our results would then suggest that the mobility of 0.5 cm 2 /V s measured in single crystals of C 60 was limited by extrinsic effects such as impurities and structural defects and that the intrinsic electron mobility of C 60 can possibly be significantly higher than 1 cm 2 /V s. 4 Conclusions Organic field-effect transistors have been fabricated from thin films of C 60 and C 70 purified by zone sublimation and deposited into thin films under high vacuum. These devices have been tested in an inert nitrogen atmosphere at ambient pressure and have exhibited saturation regime electron field-effect mobilities as large as 0.65 cm 2 /V s for C 60 and 0.066 cm 2 /V s for C 70 . The mobility value for C 60 is slightly higher than the state of the art value obtained from devices tested under ultra-high vacuum and the mobility value for C 70 is more than an order of magnitude improvement over the state of the art value in that material (also obtained from devices tested under ultra-high vacuum). Our results indicate that carefully passivated devices fabricated from a highly purified fullerene and pentacene could be good candidates for complementary organic semiconductor circuits.

        "title": "Effect of Au deposition rate on the performance of top-contact pentacene organic field-effect transistors",
        "abstract": "A study of the influence of the deposition rate of top-contact Au source and drain electrodes deposited by electron-beam evaporation on the electrical performance of pentacene organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) is presented. By adjusting the deposition rate of the Au electrodes to minimize metal diffusion into the semiconductor pentacene layer, the source/drain contact resistance could be reduced. At a Au deposition rate of 10 \u00c5/s, high-performance pentacene p -channel OFETs were obtained with a field-effect mobility of 0.9 cm 2 /Vs and a normalized channel width resistance of 23 k\u03a9 cm in a device with a channel length of 25 \u03bcm. Keywords Organic field-effect transistor Pentacene Au diffusion Metal/organic and organic/metal interfaces play an important role in organic electronics and often limit the performance of discrete devices such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Such heterointerfaces are often regarded as abrupt interfaces and their electrical properties are described in terms of relative energy barrier height defined by the work function of the metal and the molecular orbital energies of the organic semiconductor. Furthermore, this barrier height can be affected by the formation of surface dipoles at this interface and doping effects. On the other hand, the interfacial contact properties can also be greatly influenced by the inter-diffusion between metal atoms and organic molecules during the metallization process and post-annealing, especially when metal is directly deposited onto organic materials [1\u20133] . Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [4] and radiotracer [5] studies have shown that noble metals tend to diffuse into the organic film and form metallic and nonmetallic clusters. Therefore, when constructing high-performance top-contact OFETs, it is important to understand the influence of the metal diffusion into the organic film on its electrical performance. In p -channel OFETs noble metals such as gold provide generally good electrical contact to hole transport materials such as pentacene due to a good match between the work function of the metal and the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the semiconductor. For Au, a noble metal with a high work function of 5.05 eV, the hole injection barrier height into pentacene is estimated at 0.47 eV [6] . In pentacene OFETs, the device performance is strongly dependent on the polycrystalline structure of the pentacene film. Hence, changes in film morphology due to the interaction of pentacene molecules with high energy Au atoms/clusters during the electrode deposition are expected to have a strong influence on the performance of the OFET device and are worth studying in details. Here, we investigate the influence of the deposition rate of Au on its diffusion into pentacene and the related effect on contact resistance and device performance in top-contact pentacene OFETs with Au as source/drain electrodes fabricated by electron-beam deposition. While some reports on OFETs [7,8] had previously shown that Au atoms can penetrate into pentacene films, this study shows that the deposition rate also influences the lateral diffusion of Au. By adjusting the deposition rate of Au electrodes, high-performance pentacene OFETs were achieved with a minimized interfacial morphology change and moderate interface contact resistance. Top-contact pentacene OFETs were fabricated on heavily n-doped silicon substrates ( n + -Si, as the gate electrode) with 200 nm thick thermally grown SiO 2 as the gate dielectric insulator. To better control the interfacial properties at the SiO 2 dielectric and pentacene, the SiO 2 dielectric surface was passivated with a thin buffer layer of polystyrene (PS). PS films were spin-coated from a 4 mg/ml solution in toluene and annealed at 130 \u00b0C on a hot plate for 1 h. The root-mean-square ( rms ) surface roughness of PS-coated 200 nm thick SiO 2 was below 3 \u00c5 as measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The total capacitance density C OX (nF/cm 2 ), measured from parallel-plate capacitors with 12 varying contact areas, was 15.3 nF/cm 2 with a layer of PS, reduced from 16.6 nF/cm 2 without coating. After PS coating, the SiO 2 surface becomes hydrophobic with a water contact angle of 84\u00b0. Pentacene (Aldrich), purified using gradient zone sublimation, was deposited at a deposition rate of 0.3 \u00c5/s, as measured by a crystal monitor. The temperature and pressure during deposition were 25 \u00b0C and 2 \u00d7 10 \u22128 Torr, respectively. Subsequently, Au films of 80 nm were deposited onto pentacene films using an E-beam evaporation system. To avoid the effect of heat generated during the deposition on the diffusion of metal atoms, the substrate holder was cooled with water below room temperature through out the deposition process. While maintaining the same nominal thickness, a series of deposition rates varying from 0.5 \u00c5/s to 15 \u00c5/s were used to fabricate OFETs. The source/drain electrodes were patterned through a shadow mask in direct contact with the samples. The samples were transferred into a dark N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2 , H 2 O < 1 ppm) for electrical testing. The electrical measurements were performed using an Agilent E5272A source/monitor unit. Other than the deposition rate for Au electrodes, all the samples were processed and tested under identical conditions. Fig. 1 a and b show the effect of channel length scaling on field-effect hole mobility \u03bc and drain-source current I DS of a group of devices with channel lengths L varying from 25 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm and a fixed channel width W = 1000 \u03bcm. The mobilities were calculated in the saturation regime (drain-source voltage V DS = \u221230 V) using the square-law model developed for metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) [9] . The drain-source currents were measured with V GS = V DS = \u221230 V. As shown in Fig. 1 a, with faster Au electrodes deposition rates (10 \u00c5/s and 15 \u00c5/s), the OFETs yield field-effect mobility values that are nearly constant for all values of channel lengths L with a slightly higher value for L = 25 \u03bcm. In contrast, when the source/drain electrodes were deposited at slower rates, the mobility values start to drop not only in the short-channel devices but also in the devices with longer channel. At the lowest deposition rate of 0.5 \u00c5/s, the devices exhibit severe channel-scaling effects and the mobility is found to decrease by an order of magnitude even in devices with large channel length ( L = 200 \u03bcm). Consequently, with slower deposition rates (0.5 \u00c5/s and 5 \u00c5/s), the devices show typical contact-limited behavior where the current stops increasing and even drops with narrowing channel length (see Fig. 1 b). At fast deposition rates (10 \u00c5 and 15 \u00c5), the devices start to show typical channel-scaling behavior similar to that of MOSFETs: the channel current is proportional to the inverse of the channel length. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) top-view images near the channel of devices fabricated at different Au deposition rates are shown in Fig. 2 . Regardless of the Au deposition rate, the pentacene films show similar well-ordered polycrystalline morphology. However, the profiles at the edges of the source/drain electrodes show distinctly different features with smoother edges at lower Au deposition rates and much rougher edges at higher Au deposition rates. As compared with the photograph of the shadow mask shown in Fig. 3 , these rougher edges reproduce the real edge profile of the shadow mask with higher fidelity at high deposition rates. At a slower Au deposition rate of 0.5 \u00c5/s, the AFM image clearly shows that the rough edges disappear, indicating a lateral diffusion of the Au atoms during deposition. To further investigate this lateral diffusion, AFM images across the channels (see in Fig. 3 ) are compared for the devices fabricated at the lowest rate of 0.5 \u00c5/s and the highest rate of 15 \u00c5/s. The section analyses of the profiles clearly show a sharp edge at 15 \u00c5/s with an edge profile close to that of the shadow mask. The edge at 0.5 \u00c5/s is rather blunt with a slow interface transition of several microns in a channel of only 25 \u03bcm. Due to the blurry and broad edge, the channel appears to be wider and shallower. The above results confirm the occurrence of both vertical as well as lateral diffusion of Au atoms into the pentacene films. The effect of the diffusion of Au atoms into the pentacene film on the contact properties at the interface can be investigated by measuring the contact resistance between the Au source/drain electrodes and pentacene. As shown in Fig. 4 , the width-normalized total source and drain contact resistance R C W of pentacene OFETs with Au deposited at different rates was extracted using a transmission line method (TLM) [10] . Devices with channel lengths ranging from 25 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm and a fixed channel width of 1000 \u03bcm were fabricated and characterized to extract the contact resistance at low V DS = \u22121 V and for V GS values ranging from \u221210 V to \u221230 V. The reduced resistance can be attributed to the lower injection barrier and/or higher induced charge density in the channel at increased V GS . At a slow rate of 0.5 \u00c5/s, the resistance is too large to be estimated using TLM. For the other deposition rates, the total contact resistance of pentacene OFETs drops with increased deposition rate and reaches a lowest value of 23 k\u03a9 cm at a deposition rate of 10 \u00c5/s. Slightly higher values of the contact resistance at the highest deposition rate of 15 \u00c5/s could be attributed to damage caused to the film by the high flux of Au atoms during deposition. The lowest value of contact resistance obtained in our studies, in which Au was deposited by electron-beam evaporation, is not as low as the best result reported by Klauk [11] , but very similar to those reported by many groups [12,13] with Au deposited with a thermal evaporator. More importantly, the pentacene OFETs fabricated with a Au deposition rate of 10 \u00c5/s show overall high-performance as seen in Fig. 5 and Table 1 . Fig. 5 also compares the transfer (at V DS = \u221230 V) and output (at V GS = \u221230 V) characteristics for the devices with a long-channel length ( L = 200 \u03bcm) and a short-channel length ( L = 25 \u03bcm). Both devices show comparable high field-effect mobility values of \u03bc = 0.95 cm 2 /Vs for the long-channel device and \u03bc = 0.90 cm 2 /Vs for the short-channel device. At the same time, the short-channel device shows some level of short-channel effect with earlier turn-on (therefore slight higher threshold voltage), and higher subthreshold slope. In conclusion, high-performance pentacene OFETs were obtained with a reduced contact resistance by adjusting the deposition rate of Au top-contact source and drain electrodes deposited by electron-beam evaporation. As observed in AFM images, Au has a tendency to diffuse laterally into the pentacene films at lower deposition rates. Diffusion effects were found less pronounced at fast deposition rates. Conditions for reduced diffusion were found to be favorable to minimize contact resistance and yield high-performance pentacene OFETs.

        "abstract": "Active Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode (AMOLED) displays offer distinct benefits for portable electronics applications, including light weight, high brightness, low power consumption, wide viewing angle, and low processing costs. They also are attractive candidates for highly flexible substrates. In active matrix displays, a small transistor circuit is used to drive each OLED device. Recently developed organic thin film transistors (TFTs) have made complementary TFT circuits possible on flexible substrates. We present an organic complementary amplifier as an AMOLED pixel driver. The 7 TFT amplifier circuit is able to achieve less than 1% current drift for a 2x Vt change, and fill factor of 75% with a 20\u03bcm minimum channel length. The amplifier combines programming speed comparable to an equivalent 2-TFT voltage-programmed circuit with stability akin to a 4-TFT circuit, the trade-off being higher TFT count.",

        "abstract": "To compare the toxicity of mechanism beta amyloid peptide (Abeta) 25-35 and 31-35 to cultured rat cortical neurons.The primary rat cerebral cortical neurons of rat were cultured 48 hours and randomly divided into control, Abeta25-35 (25 micromol/L)and Abeta31-35 (25 micromol/L) treated groups. After twenty four hours culturing, the cells were collected MTT assay was performed to measure the viability of cultured neurons. The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined to investigate the alteration of mitochondrial structure and function of neurons by laser scanning confocal microscope. The DNA damage of neurons was measured by single cell gel electrophoresis. The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and p53 gene were measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Each experiment was repeated three times.The absorbance (0.746 +/- 0.071, 0.811 +/- 0.083) and fluorescence intensity (3.050 +/- 0.240, 2.806 +/- 0.203) of neurons in Abeta25-35 and 31-35 treated group were significantly lower (t(A) were 4.023 and 5.401, t(fluorescence intensity) were 9.524 and 7.589 respectively, P < 0.01) than those in control group (1.038 +/- 0.125 and 4.280 +/- 0.358 respectively). The percentage of comet cells (59.0%, 48.5%) and tail length (57.3 +/- 4.7, 54.2 +/- 6.8) microm in Abeta25-35 and 31-35 treated group were significantly higher (chi(2)(comet cell) were 99.397 and 137.071, t(tail length) were 19.058 and 29.173 respectively, P < 0.01) than those in control group (4.5% and (5.2 +/- 1.1) microm respectively). Compared with control group (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio 0.2090 +/- 0.0991, p53/beta-actin ratio 1.6560 +/- 0.0853), the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (t value were 2.429 and 2.356 respectively, P < 0.05) and expressions of p53 (t value were 2.366 and 2.503 respectively, P < 0.05) gene were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in Abeta25-35 (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio 1.2774 +/- 0.0762, p53/beta-actin ratio 2.0284 +/- 0.2223) and Abeta31-35 (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio 1.0330 +/- 0.0683, p53/beta-actin ratio 1.9505 +/- 0.2725) treated group.Neurotoxicity-induced by Abeta31-35 in cortical neurons is similar to that induced by Abeta25-35, which is possibly related to its direct neurotoxic and apoptotic effects to neurons.",

        "abstract": "Genistein and folic acid have been reported respectively to protect against the development of cognitive dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanism(s) for this protection remain unknown. In this report, the mechanism(s) contributing to the neuroprotective effects of genistein and folic acid were explored using rat cortical neuron cultures. We found that genistein and folic acid, both separately and collaboratively, increased cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential in beta-amyloid (Abeta) 31-35-treated neurons. Furthermore, reduced percentage of comet cells and shortened tail length were observed in the neurons treated with genistein or folic acid. A more significant reduction in tail length of the comet neurons was observed in the co-administered neurons. RT-PCR analysis of the cultured cortical neurons showed down-regulated expression of p53, bax and caspase-3, but up-regulated expression of bcl-2 in the three neuroprotective treatment groups compared with neurons from the Abeta31-35 solo-treated group. In a nuclear dyeing experiment using Hoechst 33342, we found that both genistein and folic acid prevent neuronal apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that the mechanism underlying the neuroprotection of genistein and folic acid singly or in combination observed in cultured cortical neuron studies might be related to their anti-apoptotic properties.",

Animal model studies of Tp DNA vaccines have not been reported elsewhere but our previous reports describe the development of a single-gene Tp DNA vaccine and preclinical immunization study. In this study, chitosan (CS) nanoparticles were used as a vector and an interleukin-2 expression plasmid (pIL-2) as an adjuvant to enhance a TpGpd DNA vaccine candidate (pTpGpd) in a rabbit Tp skin challenge model. At week 8 after the first immunization, three rabbits from each group were used to determine cytokine measurements and spleen lymphocyte proliferation assay. pTpGpd in combination with pIL-2 wrapped with CS led to the greatest enhancement of anti-TpGpd antibodies and T-cell proliferation. During infection, levels of anti-TpGpd antibodies and T-cell proliferation were measured. Both the serum special IgG and IL-2, interferon-\u03b3 were significantly increased by the co-injection of the IL-2 plasmid compared with the injection of TpGpd DNA alone (P<0.05). Furthermore, IL-2 plasmid coinjection efficiently enhanced the antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation response. Additionally, the ratios of positive skin lesions and ulcer lesions in groups immunized with pTpGpd were significantly lower than those of the pIL-2, CS or pIL-2 mixed with CS control groups (P<0.001). CS vectored and pIL-2 adjuvanted pTpGpd immunized animals exhibited the lowest rates of positive skin tests (8.33%) and ulcer lesions (4.17%) and the fastest recovery (42 d). These experiments indicate that co-injection of a pIL-2 plasmid with pTpGpd DNA vaccine wrapped with CS can significantly strengthen the long-term stability of immune response during infection, efficiently improve the protective effect against T. pallidum spirochetes infection and attenuate syphilitic lesion development.",

        "title": "Variations of the Tropopause Over Different Latitude Bands Observed Using COSMIC Radio Occultation Bending Angles",
        "abstract": "The tropopause is a transition layer between the troposphere and the stratosphere. The exchange of air, water vapor, trace gases, and energy between the troposphere and the stratosphere occurs in this layer. Accurate and continuous observations of the tropopause on a global scale are crucial for monitoring stratosphere-troposphere exchange and understanding the properties of atmosphere in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. In this paper, the tropopause heights are identified from Global Positioning System radio occultation (RO) bending angle profiles using the covariance transform method. Temporal variations of the tropopause parameters, including the tropopause height, temperature, and pressure at different latitude bands are investigated using the RO observations from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate mission during the period from January 2007 to December 2011. We divide the Earth into 18 nonoverlapping latitude bands 10 \u00b0 wide. Monthly averages of the tropopause parameters weighted by area are calculated at each latitude band and the temporal variations of these tropopause parameters are analyzed. The results indicate that the latitudinal variation patterns of the tropopause parameters in the Northern Hemisphere are different than those in the Southern Hemisphere. The relationship between the variations of different tropopause parameters is studied. The results show that the variation of the tropopause temperature and pressure is negatively correlated with that of the tropopause height in most of the latitude bands. In addition, the trend of the variation of the tropopause height in each latitude band is calculated with the median of pairwise slopes regression method. We find that the overall trend in the tropopause height varies in different latitude bands. The global average tropopause height decreases ~ 7 m/a during the period from 2007 to 2011.",

        "abstract": "Gene duplication plays an important role in the evolution of diversity and novel function and is especially prevalent in the nuclear genomes of flowering plants. Duplicate genes may be maintained through subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization at the level of expression or coding sequence. In order to test the hypothesis that duplicated regulatory genes will be differentially expressed in a specific manner indicative of regulatory subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization, we examined expression pattern shifts in duplicated regulatory genes in Arabidopsis. A two-way analysis of variance was performed on expression data for 280 phylogenetically identified paralogous pairs. Expression data were extracted from global expression profiles for wild-type root, stem, leaf, developing inflorescence, nearly mature flower buds, and seedpod. Gene, organ, and gene by organ interaction (G x O) effects were examined. Results indicate that 85% of the paralogous pairs exhibited a significant G x O effect indicative of regulatory subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization. A significant G x O effect was associated with complementary expression patterns in 45% of pairwise comparisons. No association was detected between a G x O effect and a relaxed evolutionary constraint as detected by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions. Ancestral gene expression patterns inferred across a Type II MADS-box gene phylogeny suggest several cases of regulatory neofunctionalization and organ-specific nonfunctionalization. Complete linkage clustering of gene expression levels across organs suggests that regulatory modules for each organ are independent or ancestral genes had limited expression. We propose a new classification, regulatory hypofunctionalization, for an overall decrease in expression level in one member of a paralogous pair while still having a significant G x O effect. We conclude that expression divergence specifically indicative of subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization contributes to the maintenance of most if not all duplicated regulatory genes in Arabidopsis and hypothesize that this results in increasing expression diversity or specificity of regulatory genes after each round of duplication.",

        "title": "Floral gene resources from basal angiosperms for comparative genomics research",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Floral Genome Project was initiated to bridge the genomic gap between the most broadly studied plant model systems. Arabidopsis and rice, although now completely sequenced and under intensive comparative genomic investigation, are separated by at least 125 million years of evolutionary time, and cannot in isolation provide a comprehensive perspective on structural and functional aspects of flowering plant genome dynamics. Here we discuss new genomic resources available to the scientific community, comprising cDNA libraries and Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences for a suite of phylogenetically basal angiosperms specifically selected to bridge the evolutionary gaps between model plants and provide insights into gene content and genome structure in the earliest flowering plants. RESULTS: Random sequencing of cDNAs from representatives of phylogenetically important eudicot, non-grass monocot, and gymnosperm lineages has so far (as of 12/1/04) generated 70,514 ESTs and 48,170 assembled unigenes. Efficient sorting of EST sequences into putative gene families based on whole Arabidopsis/rice proteome comparison has permitted ready identification of cDNA clones for finished sequencing. Preliminarily, (i) proportions of functional categories among sequenced floral genes seem representative of the entire Arabidopsis transcriptome, (ii) many known floral gene homologues have been captured, and (iii) phylogenetic analyses of ESTs are providing new insights into the process of gene family evolution in relation to the origin and diversification of the angiosperms. CONCLUSION: Initial comparisons illustrate the utility of the EST data sets toward discovery of the basic floral transcriptome. These first findings also afford the opportunity to address a number of conspicuous evolutionary genomic questions, including reproductive organ transcriptome overlap between angiosperms and gymnosperms, genome-wide duplication history, lineage-specific gene duplication and functional divergence, and analyses of adaptive molecular evolution. Since not all genes in the floral transcriptome will be associated with flowering, these EST resources will also be of interest to plant scientists working on other functions, such as photosynthesis, signal transduction, and metabolic pathways.",

        "abstract": "We have used oligonucleotide microarrays to detect Arabidopsis gene expression during early flower development. Among the 22,746 genes represented on the Affymetrix ATH1 chip, approximately 14,660 (approximately 64.5%) genes were expressed with signal intensity at or more than 50 in each of the six organs/structures examined, including young inflorescences (floral stages 1-9), stage-12 floral buds, developing siliques, leaves, stems, and roots. 17,583 genes were expressed with an intensity at or above 50 in at least one tissue, including 12,245 genes that were expressed in all the six tissues. Comparison of genes expressed between young inflorescence or stage-12 floral buds with other tissues suggests that relatively large numbers of genes are expressed at similar levels in tissues that are related morphologically and/or developmentally, as supported by a cluster analysis with data from two other studies. Further analysis of the genes preferentially expressed in floral tissues has uncovered new genes potentially involved in Arabidopsis flower development. One hundred and four genes were determined to be preferentially expressed in young inflorescences, including 22 genes encoding putative transcription factors. We also identified 105 genes that were preferentially expressed in three reproductive structures (the young inflorescences, stage-12 floral buds and developing siliques), when compared with the vegetative tissues. RT-PCR results of selected genes are consistent with the results from these microarrays and suggest that the relative signal intensities detected with the Affymetrix microarray are reliable estimates of gene expression.",

The reaction can proceed via I 2-mediated intramolecular annulation reaction of 2-alkynylanisoles with diaryl disulfides (diselenides) in water or under solvent-free conditions at room temperature. With the participation of I2, a variety of 3-chalcogen benzo[b]furan derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yields. This reaction was considered to work via an iodocyclization cascade mechanism and the intermediate 3-iodo-2-phenylbenzofuran was detected by GC-MS. \u00a9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

This facile synthesis not only offers an economical and efficient synthetic strategy to this class of significant compounds but also enriches the investigations on microwave-assisted multicomponent reactions. Moreover, this protocol has the prominent advantages of short reaction time, good yields, low cost, easy operation, as well as environmental-friendliness. \u00a9 2009 HeteroCorporation.",

The results reveal that the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and constant surfactant tension (\u03b3 cac) are lower than that of butyl isoquinolinium bromide ([C4iQuin]Br), octyl isoquinolinium bromide ([C8iQuin]Br, and lauryl pyridinium bromide ([C12Pyr]Br). 1H NMR spectra show the evidence of paralleled \u03c0-stacking of adjacent isoquinoline rings. To elucidate the effect of the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions on the aggregation process, thermodynamic parameters such as the standard free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of aggregation have been discussed. These parameters are evaluated from the CMC with temperature by fitting these values to expressions derived from a micellization thermodynamic model. The enthalpy\u2013entropy compensation phenomenon has been observed in the micellization process of [C12iQuin]Br in water, and the presence of isoquinoline cations is responsible for the decrease in the \u0394H  mic \u2217 , compared with [C12Pyr]Br which has the same alkyl chain and counter-ion.",

However, HA hydrogel with improved residence time and mechanical integrity that allows the survival of hPSCs under defined conditions is still much needed for clinical applications. In this study, HA was modified with methacrylate functional groups (MeHA) and cross-linked by photo-crosslinking method. After subsequent conjugation with adhesive peptide, these MeHA surfaces demonstrated performance in facilitating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) proliferation, and good pluripotency maintenance of hiPSCs under defined conditions. Moreover, MeHA films on glass-slides exhibited long residence time and mechanical stability throughout hiPSC culture. Our photo-crosslinkable MeHA possesses great value in accelerating the application of HA hydrogel in hiPSCs proliferation and differentiation with the conjugation of adhesive peptides.",

        "abstract": "Nano-hydroxyapatite (HA) synthesized by biomimetic strategy is a promising nanomaterial as bone substitute due to its physicochemical features similar to those of natural nanocrystal in bone tissue. Inspired by mussel adhesive chemistry, a novel nano-HA was synthesized in our work by employing polydopamine (pDA) as template under weak alkaline condition. Subsequently, the as-prepared pDA-templated HA (tHA) was introduced into polycaprolactone (PCL) matrix via co-electrospinning, and a bioactive tHA/PCL composite nanofiber scaffold was developed targeted at bone regeneration application. Our research showed that tHA reinforced PCL composite nanofibers exhibited favorable cytocompatibility at given concentration of tHA (0~10 w.t%). Compared to pure PCL and traditional nano-HA enriched PCL (HA/PCL) composite nanofibers, enhanced cell adhesion, spreading and proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were observed on tHA/PCL composite nanofibers on account of the contribution of pDA present in tHA. More importantly, tHA nanoparticles exposed on the surface of composite nanofibers could further promote osteogenesis of hMSCs in vitro even in the absence of osteogenesis soluble inducing factors when compared to traditional HA/PCL scaffolds, which was supported by in vivo test as well according to the histological analysis. Overall, our study demonstrated that the developed tHA/PCL composite nanofibers with enhanced cytocompatibility and osteogenic capacity hold great potential as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "The ability to obtain a large number of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) under chemically defined conditions plays a key role in clinical application of hPSCs. Chemically defined, economical and effective synthetic peptide displaying surfaces should be the optimal choice for clinical applications involving hPSCs. However, synthetic peptide displaying surfaces are worse than Matrigel surface in supporting cell adhesion and self-renewal. Moreover, the correlations between peptide amino acid sequences and the ability of peptides to support cell survival has never been investigated in hPSCs. In this study, we focused on the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence and integrin receptors, which constitute the major recognition system for cell adhesion. Several new RGD-containing peptides were designed by altering the amino acids surrounding the RGD sequence. We investigated the ability of these peptides to sustain hPSC survival, and identified the Ac-KGGPQVTRGDTYRAY sequence, which was capable of supporting cell reprogramming, long-term self-renewal and lineage differentiation. In addition, this report demonstrates that the introduction of mutations in the amino acids surrounding the RGD sequence is a good strategy to design peptides that display excellent adhesion properties and promote hPSC self-renewal. Our results will help improve the current understanding of the mechanisms by which RGD-containing peptides exhibit different abilities in sustaining hPSC culture, and will promote clinical application of both peptide displaying surfaces and hPSCs.",

        "abstract": "Adult sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a rare aggressive neoplasm and represents ~1-5% of all lymphomas diagnosed in adults. The disease exhibits an aggressive clinical manifestation, which frequently involves the central nervous system (CNS) in the early stages, and is usually accompanied by abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations and/or neuroradiography. The current study describes the rare case of a 29-year-old man who presented with oculomotor nerve palsy without palpated masses, B symptoms, peripheral blood anomaly and abnormalities of the nervous system. The patient was initially misdiagnosed with abducens diplopia, but was subsequently confirmed to have BL with early CNS invasion. Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative. Intensive systemic chemotherapy with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, therarubicin and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m on days 2-4; vincristine 1.4 mg/m on days 5 and 12, therarubicin 50 mg/m on day 5 and dexamethasone 40 mg on days 2-5 and 12-15), including intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate (5 mg), arabinocytidine (5 mg) and dexamethasone (5 mg), was determined as an appropriate treatment. Rituximab (375 mg/m on day 1) was administered alongside chemotherapy to increase treatment efficacy. The patient temporarily underwent complete remission, but subsequently relapsed as no suitable bone marrow donor was available. Adult sporadic BL with early CNS invasion, which traditional tests such as neuroradiography and CSF examination fail to identify, is uncommon. Therefore, appropriate diagnostic tests are critical for accurate diagnosis and must be performed immediately, particularly in patients that present with unusual image and laboratory manifestations.",

The present study reports the case of a 50-year-old woman with transient pancytopenia, which manifested as a fever, cough and severe anemia. Three weeks following treatment of pancytopenia with antibiotics, red blood cell and platelet transfusion, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and human \u03b3 globulin, the condition of the patient was improved. However, 3 weeks following discharge from hospital, the patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with complex chromosomal abnormalities, including Philadelphia chromosome and P190 breakpoint cluster region-ABL. Complete remission was achieved following one course of combination chemotherapy. In conclusion, adult ALL with pancytopenia as a preceding symptom is rare, difficult to diagnose early and easily misdiagnosed. In addition, the pathogenesis of ALL and the precipitating factors underlying this disease require further investigation.",

        "title": "The Incidence of HBV Reactivation in Patients Receiving First-Line R-CHOP Chemotherapy: Three-Year Follow-up Results from a Prospective, Observational Study",
        "abstract": "Background:   Due to the high rate of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in China, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) can be detected among 25-61% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 20-40% with follicular lymphoma (FL), while HBsAg- negative (neg) /HBcAb-positive (pos) can be detected among 20-44% of patients with DLBCL (Chinese Society of Hematology, 2013). When these patients receive immune-suppressing treatment, they are at an increased risk of HBV reactivation which may lead to hepatic mortality and interrupt the rituximab-based chemotherapy. For patients and their physicians, HBV infection management plays a crucial role for achieving optimal survival outcomes without compromising safety. This multicenter, single-arm, prospective, non-interventional study was conducted at 24 centers in China between January 17, 2011 and October 31, 2016. Previously untreated CD20-positive DLBCL patients who were eligible to receive rituximab plus chemotherapy (R-chemo) (CHOP or non-CHOP) as first-line treatment were enrolled with no specific exclusion criteria. We investigated the risk of HBV reactivation in patients with CD20+ DLBCL or FL which received R-chemo as first-line treatment.   Methods:   Patients who received at least one dose of R-chemo were included in the analysis. Data were collected and analyzed from medical records for 3 years since the last R dose was administered. The evaluation of HBV infection management included HBV infection and liver function screening before R-chemo, viral replication monitoring during and after R-chemo, antiviral prophylaxis use and HBV reactivation rates. HBsAg-pos patients had HBV reactivation if HBV DNA increased \u22651 log10 from baseline, if HBV DNA appeared (above the lower limit of detection) or if HBeAg appeared in HBeAg- neg patients. HBsAg-neg/HBcAb-pos patients had HBV reactivation if there was appearance of either HBsAg or HBV DNA (above the lower limit of detection). The HBV reactivation was determined by SAP and investigator9s judgment. This study was registered in clincialtrials.gov (NCT01340443).   Results:   In total, 282 DLBCL patients and 31FL patients were included in the analysis. HBV screening data were available from 271 enrolled patients. At baseline, 26 patients were HBsAg-pos, 79 were HBsAg- neg/HBcAb-pos and 166 were double neg. HBV infection status was undefined for 42 patients. During the study, HBV reactivation was detected in 8 patients, which was only in the DLBCL group. Seven cases were observed in treatment period, while 1 case occurred during 3-year follow-up. None of them led to study termination, temporary termination, or dose adjustment.  Cox univariate regression analysis in DLBCL patients showed that baseline type of hepatitis B correlated with overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) but had no effect on progression-free survival (PFS).  In term of HBV infection management, in DLBCL group, 25 patients with HBsAg-pos or HBsAg-neg/ HBcAb-pos receiving antiviral prophylaxis. In FL group, only 3 patients received antiviral treatment. Lamivudine was mostly administered by Chinese investigators. Details on treatment, duration and infection status are listed in Table 1.   Summary:   In this prospective, observational study, we followed the patients with DLBCL or FL for 3 years to investigate the risk of HBV reactivation after they received R-chemo. Our study showed that, in real-world setting, the incidence of HBV reactivation in patients with a history of hepatitis, particularly those positive for HBsAg is acceptable, baseline type of hepatitis B had no effect on PFS. Close monitoring and antiviral prophylaxis would be beneficial to the patients with DLBCL or FL combined with hepatitis B infection while they receive R-chemo.

        "abstract": "Background -Hypertension due to increased renin angiotensin system (RAS) activation is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Previous studies implicate NADPH oxidase (Nox) proteins as important ROS sources during RAS activation, with different Nox isoforms being potentially involved. Among these, Nox2 is expressed in multiple cell types including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells and microglia. Blood pressure (BP) is regulated at central nervous system, renal and vascular levels but the cell-specific role of Nox2 in BP regulation is unknown. Methods -We generated a novel mouse model with a Floxed Nox2 gene and used Tie2-Cre, LysM Cre or Cdh5-CreERT2 driver lines to develop cell-specific models of Nox2 perturbation to investigate its role in BP regulation. Results -Unexpectedly, Nox2 deletion in myeloid but not endothelial cells resulted in a significant reduction in basal BP. Tie2-CreNox2 knockout (KO) mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in both endothelial cells and myeloid cells) and LysM Cre Nox2KO mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in myeloid cells) both had significantly lower BP than littermate controls whereas basal BP was unaltered in Cdh5-CreERT2 Nox2 KO mice (in which Nox2 is deficient only in endothelial cells). The lower BP was attributable to an increased NO bioavailability which dynamically dilated resistance vessels in vivo under basal conditions, without change in renal function. Myeloid-specific Nox2 deletion had no effect on angiotensin II-induced hypertension which, however, was blunted in Tie2-CreNox2KO mice along with preservation of endothelium-dependent relaxation during angiotensin II stimulation. Conclusions -We identify a hitherto unrecognized modulation of basal BP by myeloid cell Nox2 whereas endothelial cell Nox2 regulates angiotensin II-induced hypertension. These results identify distinct cell-specific roles for Nox2 in BP regulation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is involved in the process of adverse cardiac remodeling and development of heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI). NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2) is a major ROS source within the heart and its activity increases after MI. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Nox2 is protective against post-MI cardiac remodeling. Nox2 levels may increase both in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and recent studies indicate cell-specific effects of Nox2, but it is not known which of these cell types is important in post-MI remodeling. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have generated transgenic mouse models in which Nox2 expression is targeted either to cardiomyocytes (cardio-Nox2TG) or endothelial cells (endo-Nox2TG). We here studied the response of cardio-Nox2TG mice, endo-Nox2TG mice and matched wild-type littermates (WT) to MI induced by permanent left coronary artery ligation up to 4weeks. Initial infarct size assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cardiac dysfunction were similar among groups. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis were augmented in cardio-Nox2TG compared to WT after MI and post-MI survival tended to be worse whereas endo-Nox2TG mice showed no significant difference compared to WT. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cardiomyocyte rather than endothelial cell Nox2 may have the more important role in post-MI remodeling.",

The voids in syntactic foams and their flexural properties were investigated.FindingsThe results showed that the voids quantity increased because of the increment of HGM content, whereas the exural strength and the exural modulus decreased. The fracture mechanism of the composites was also investigated by scanning electron microscope, which indicated that the composites failed by the crack extending through the microspheres.Research limitations/implicationsThe advantages of HGMs with similar hollow spheres will be further investigated in a future research.Practical implicationsResults demonstrated that the properties of the composite might be tailored for specific application conditions by changing the HGM volume fraction.Originality/valueThe HGM filled resin-matrix composite materials have their unique properties and significant application potential. In this work, the resin-HGM composites were synthesized by mechanically mixing defined quantities of HGMs into epoxy resin, by which a kind of syntactic foams with good flexural properties could be obtained.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, first principles calculations are performed to investigate the structural, electronic, and mechanical properties of the interface between \u03b2-SiC ceramics and M  n +1 AlC  n   (M\u202f=\u202fSc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta;  n \u202f=\u202f1,2) phases, with particular focus on Ti 3 AlC 2  and Ti 2 AlC. The interface between the \u03b2-SiC(111) and Ti  n+1  AlC  n   (0001) ( n \u202f=\u202f1,2) surfaces is most likely a stable interface because of the small misfit in lattice constants. Six different interface models between \u03b2-SiC(111) and Ti  n +1 AlC  n  (0001) are examined. The optimized interfacial distances are determined using the universal binding energy relation method, and then each model is fully relaxed to calculate work of adhesion. By comparison, it is determined that the junctions connecting the C-terminated SiC(111) and Ti-terminated Ti  n +1 AlC  n  (0001) surfaces are the most stable structures. Then the electronic structures for this interface model of Ti 3 AlC 2 /SiC are analyzed from the density of states, atomic charges, total electron densities and electron density difference. The elastic moduli are also computed in this study, and the data show that the mechanical properties for the composite Ti  n +1 AlC  n  /SiC slab are between those of bulk Ti  n +1 AlC  n   and \u03b2-SiC, with enhanced plasticity. Finally, the results for \u03b2-SiC/Ti  n +1 AlC  n   are extended to study the interfacial stabilization of \u03b2-SiC ceramics and the wider class of M  n +1 AlC  n   phase coatings (M\u202f=\u202fSc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta;  n \u202f=\u202f1,2). It is found that SiC ceramics may be effectively joined by M  n+1  AlC  n   with stable interfacial chemical bonding, which provides a theoretical basis for the effective junction in SiC composites.",

        "abstract": "The phase stabilities, mechanical properties and electronic structures of 3 d transition metal disilicides were systematically investigated by first-principles calculations. The results indicated that the crystal volume and melting temperature of the compounds increase at first and then drop again with the filling of electrons on the bonding and anti-bonding states. For tetragonal TiSi 2 , NiSi 2 , CuSi 2 and ZnSi 2 , the calculated formation energies and elastic constants confirmed that they are either thermodynamically unstable or mechanically unstable. According to the electronic structures, it can be identified that almost all the Si\u2013Si (I) and Si\u2013TM (I) bonds (type I) are stronger than the Si\u2013TM (II) and Si\u2013TM (II) (type II) ones. Therefore, the elastic deformation resistance along the \u30080 0 1\u3009 direction for the compounds are expected to be larger than those along the \u30081 0 0\u3009 and \u30080 1 0\u3009 directions, demonstrated by the calculated C 11 , C 33 , E x ( E y ) and E z values. Despite of the elastic constants and moduli, the results also showed that the Si\u2013Si (I) and Si\u2013TM (I) bonds are very important for elucidating the interfacial behaviors of the {0 0 1} crystal plane. For tetragonal VSi 2 and CrSi 2 , the Si\u2013Si (I) bonds are half the size of the Si\u2013TM (I) ones, leading to a preferential cleavage of the Si\u2013TM interface, and therefore they show brittle characteristics. However, the situations in FeSi 2 and CoSi 2 are different. The moderate bonding strength of type I bonds and the uniform distributions of electron density on different {0 0 1} interfaces indicate that slip systems preferentially appear. Therefore, FeSi 2 and CoSi 2 possess excellent ductility. Keywords Structural stability Mechanical property Electronic structure First-principles calculation 1 Introduction Because of their high silicon contents, high electrical conductivity, high temperature stability and corrosion resistance, the transition-metal disilicides (TMSi 2 ) have many important applications in the microelectronics industry, such as the integrated circuits for Schottky barriers, Ohmic contacts, low-resistance gates and interconnections [1,2] . Besides these applications, TMSi 2 compounds are also important in the fields of coating, energy and aerospace [3] . For example, CrSi 2 , MoSi 2 and WSi 2 are suggested to be promising candidates for the next generation of high-temperature structural materials [4\u20136] , and some MoSi 2 -based materials have been applied to molten metal lances, industrial gas burners, aerospace turbine engine components and diesel engine glow plugs [7] . However, in practical applications it has been reported that group VI transition metal disilicides are very brittle at room temperature and even suffer from a completely destructive oxidation at low temperature called the \u201cMoSi 2 \u201d pest phenomenon [8,9] . These two limitations greatly reduce their reliability and capability as high-temperature structural materials. Fortunately, like group VI transition metals, many 3 d and 4 d transition metals can form different disilicides with silicon, ranging from C 49 , C 54 and C 40 to C 11 b structures [10\u201313] . In comparison to the well-investigated group VI transition metal disilicides, the variations in outer-shell electron of transition metals may provide a feasible way to modulate the bonding characteristics of a system and therefore the corresponding macroscopic properties. However, as such a way is not clear at present, relevant investigations are needed. Moreover, the structural stabilities and mechanical properties of disilicides are also of primary importance, since they are the foundation of applications. In addition to trial-and-error experiments, predictions based on modern computational theories are very convenient and effective for solving the above issues, and can even offer some insight into the relationship between bonding and mechanical properties. With such motivations in mind, the present investigation is aimed at providing a first-principles approach to predict the structural stabilities, mechanical properties and electronic structures of tetragonal 3 d TMSi 2 materials. The rest of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 gives some computational details; results and discussions are presented in Section 3 and conclusions at the end. 2 Models and methods Although the 3 d transition metals can form a number of phases with silicon, the present calculations deal mainly with the tetragonal structures and try to identify the effect of outer-shell electrons on the bonding and mechanical properties. The computational model is illustrated in Fig. 1 a. In the I 4 /mmm structures, the sixfold-coordinated hexagonal TMSi 2 layers occur in the {1 1 0} crystal plane and the periodic stacking sequence along the \u30081 1 0\u3009 direction is ABAB. For a specific lattice, both stress and strain have three tensile and three shear components, giving six components in total. According to the elasticity theory, a 6 \u00d7 6 symmetric matrix with 36 elements is thus needed to describe the relationship between stress and strain. Due to the symmetries of a crystal, some matrix elements are equal to each other and some are fixed with a value of zero. For a tetragonal structure, only six elastic constants, corresponding to C 11 , C 12 , C 13 , C 33 , C 44 and C 66 , are independent. Therefore, the strain dependence of stress reads (1) \u03c3 x \u03c3 y \u03c3 z \u03c4 yz \u03c4 xz \u03c4 xy = C 11 C 12 C 13 0 0 0 C 12 C 11 C 13 0 0 0 C 13 C 13 C 33 0 0 0 0 0 0 C 44 0 0 0 0 0 0 C 44 0 0 0 0 0 0 C 66 \u03b5 xx \u03b5 yy \u03b5 zz \u03b3 yz \u03b3 xz \u03b3 xy where \u03c3 and \u03c4 represent tensile and shear stress while \u03b5 and \u03b3 are tensile and shear strain, respectively. By choosing the applied deformations first and then calculating the resulting stresses, the elastic constants can be determined. For the present calculations, two strain patterns corresponding to the Voigt notation ( \u03b5 xx = 1, \u03b5 yy = 0, \u03b5 zz = 0, \u03b3 yz = 1, \u03b3 xz = 0, \u03b3 xy = 0) and ( \u03b5 xx = 0, \u03b5 yy = 0, \u03b5 zz = 1, \u03b3 yz = 0, \u03b3 xz = 0, \u03b3 xy = 1) at the minimum are needed. For each strain pattern, four small strain amplitudes are considered, and the elastic constants can be obtained through the partial differentials of stress to strain. Once all the elastic constants are determined, the mechanical properties can then be clarified. The present calculations were performed within the density functional theory framework [14] built into the ABINIT software package [15,16] . The exchange\u2013correlation energy was treated with the Perdew\u2013Wang functional [17] in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) scheme. The plane-wave basis set technique was applied, and the used energy cutoff was set to 380 eV according to tests. Within the ultrasoft pseudo-potentials method [18] , the original valence configurations were 3 s 2 3 p 2 and 4 s 2 4 p 6 4 d y 5 s 2 for Si and the 3 d transition metals, respectively. Sampling over the Brillouin zone was treated by a (8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 3) Monkhorst\u2013Pack mesh [19] . As some TMSi 2 compounds possess hypothetical structures, the geometry optimization is needed to determine the equilibrium lattices. By using the Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shannon algorithm [20] , the optimization process was repeated until the average force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV \u00c5 \u22121 and the energy change less than 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 eV atom \u22121 . For each structure, the spin-unrestricted technique was also applied, namely two different electronic configurations corresponding to the minority and majority spin were applied during the optimization process. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Structural stabilities Table 1 lists some equilibrium properties for tetragonal TMSi 2 compounds. In comparison to the available data [12,13] , the present values are moderate, and the error for the lattice constants is within 1.5%. It can be noted that when the outer-shell electron increases, the lattice volume decreases at first and then increases again. Such a peculiar behavior suggests remarkable changes in systematic bonding, as discussed below. To evaluate the phase stability, the formation energy is calculated by (2) \u0394 H f = E tot TMSi 2 - ( 1 E cond TM - 2 E cond Si ) where E tot TMSi 2 refers the total energy of TMSi 2 compounds at equilibrium lattice and E cond X is the total energy of pure X in solid phase. The results from Table 1 clearly show that the formation energy of 3 d TMSi 2 compounds also follows a variation trend similar to the lattice volume. NiSi 2 , CuSi 2 and ZnSi 2 are found to be thermodynamically unstable. Although the rest of the TMSi 2 compounds are predicted to be stable, they may have other stable structures. For example, it is reported that the experimental configurations of ScSi 2 , TiSi 2 and VSi 2 are C 32 , C 54 and C 40 phases respectively [13,21] , while those of CoSi 2 and NiSi 2 are C 1 ones [13] . The existence of several stable crystal phases for a typical compound indicates a sequence of phase transitions from high to low temperatures, and the mechanical properties should be changed accordingly in response to such transitions. For MoSi 2 and WSi 2 analogues, it has been confirmed theoretically and experimentally that the very brittle tetragonal phases ( I 4 /mmm ) are more stable than the hexagonal ones ( P 6222 ) [6,22] . Therefore, they both undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition as the temperature is lowered, leading to the problems mentioned in the introduction. However, the situation in 3 d TMSi 2 compounds may be somewhat different. According to a previous investigation [22] , for MoSi 2 the reduction of symmetries from I 4 /mmm to P 6222 structures can lead to an improvement in ductility. Therefore it can be deduced that if tetragonal 3 d TMSi 2 compounds possess excellent ductility, the ductile-to-brittle transformation may be prevented as the temperature changes. Further investigations would be helpful to verify the effect of phase transitions on the mechanical properties, and these will be reported elsewhere. In the present calculation, our concerns are focused mainly on the effect of outer-shell electrons on the bonding and mechanical properties of the systems. As well as the thermodynamic properties, the mechanical stability conditions, which reflect the structural stability of materials at specific deformations, are also very important and should be carefully examined. By expanding the internal energy of a crystal in a range of strains and imposing the positivity of the energy, Born and Huang [23] systematically investigated the lattice mechanical stability and formulated the stability criteria in terms of the elastic constants C ij . They found that the criterion for a mechanically stable lattice requires the elastic energy density be a positive definite quadratic function of strain. For a tetragonal crystal, only six elastic constants are independent and the corresponding mechanical stability criterion is [23,24] (3) C 44 > 0 , C 66 > 0 , C 11 > | C 12 | , and C 11 + C 12 - 2 C 13 2 C 33 > 0 Table 2 lists the complete sets of elastic constants for 3 d TMSi 2 compounds. It can be readily seen that the C 44 values for tetragonal NiSi 2 and CuSi 2 are negative, indicating that they are both unstable under elastic strain perturbations. For TiSi 2 , C 12 , calculated to be 290.13 Gpa, is larger than C 11 (8.89 GPa) and Eq. (3) cannot be fulfilled. As a result, tetragonal TiSi 2 is also mechanically unstable. Except for the three compounds just mentioned, the elastic constants of the other disilicides are satisfied by Eq. (3) and are all mechanically stable. As the elastic constants were determined, some mechanical properties can be predicted. 3.2 Mechanical properties The bulk modulus ( B ) is a measure of the resistance of a material against volume change under hydrostatic pressure, while the shear modulus ( G ) describes the resistance to shape change caused by a shearing force. Young\u2019s modulus ( E ) reflects the resistance of materials against uniaxial tensions. These parameters are very important for defining the mechanical properties of materials and can be expressed in terms of elastic constants. For a tetragonal structure, the bulk modulus can be estimated by [22,25] . (4) B = 2 9 ( C 11 + C 12 + 2 C 13 + 1 2 C 33 ) The Young\u2019s modulus and isotropic shear modulus can be calculated by [22,25,26] . (5) E x = E y = [ C 33 ( C 11 + C 12 ) - 2 C 13 2 ] ( C 11 - C 12 ) C 11 C 33 - C 13 2 , E z = [ C 33 ( C 11 + C 12 ) - 2 C 13 2 ] C 11 - C 12 (6) G = 1 15 [ ( 2 C 11 + C 33 ) - ( 2 C 12 + C 13 ) + 3 ( 2 C 44 + C 66 ) ] The corresponding data are listed in Table 3 . Due to the mechanically instabilities discussed above, the Young\u2019s moduli for TiSi 2 , NiSi 2 and CuSi 2 are abnormal and the three compounds will be excluded in the following discussions. It can be confirmed that the resistance of early and late 3 d transition metal disilicides to the volume change is rather weak, while the bulk moduli of the mid-3 d TMSi 2 are much larger. The bulk moduli of mid-3d TMSi 2 are more than twice as large as those of early and late 3d TMSi 2 compound. This behavior is not only connected to the changes in lattice volume but also reflects intrinsically the changes in bonding along three basic lattice vectors. By computing the Young\u2019s moduli, the anisotropic effect can be exemplified. For all stable structures, their Young\u2019s moduli along the \u30080 0 1\u3009 direction ( E z ) are always larger than those along the \u30081 0 0\u3009 and \u30080 1 0\u3009 directions ( E x and E y ), suggesting the inter-atomic interactions along the \u30080 0 1\u3009 direction are much stronger. To evaluate the brittle and ductility behaviors, the G / B ratio, a relationship empirically linking the plastic and elastic properties of materials, is introduced. Usually, a low G / B ratio is associated with ductility, whereas a high value corresponds to brittleness [25,27] . The critical value that sets the two behaviors apart has been suggested to be 0.57 [22,28] . The results listed in Table 3 indicate that for the stable structures the G / B ratio increases from 0.66 to 0.89 and then decreases to 0.46. According to the critical value, two categories of materials can be clarified. VSi 2 and CrSi 2 are typically brittle. According to experiments, it has been confirmed that their hexagonal phases are the most stable ones [10,12] , quantitatively in agreement with our data ( Fig. S4 ). Therefore the tetragonal structures can be considered as metastable phases, corresponding to high-temperature configurations. This result suggests that their high-temperature ductility performance is poor. The G / B ratios of FeSi 2 and CoSi 2 are much smaller than the critical value, and they both possess excellent ductility. By further examining the bulk and shear moduli, it can be clarified that the differences of VSi 2 and CrSi 2 with respect to FeSi 2 and CoSi 2 can be attributed to the shear modulus. According to Eq. (6) , the smaller shear moduli require larger (2 C 12 + C 13 ) values and smaller (2 C 44 + C 66 ) ones. The calculated F factor confirms the dominant effect of C 12 , C 13 , C 44 and C 66 on the ductility and brittleness of tetragonal TMSi 2 compounds, since F is linearly correlated with the G / B ratio. Moreover, because C 44 and C 66 also reflect the shear deformations while C 12 and C 13 reflect the shear and elastic ones, the above values can be used to estimate the slip systems of materials too. For FeSi 2 and CoSi 2 , the C 44 and C 66 values are very small, indicating that the \u30080 1 0\u3009{1 0 0}, \u30080 0 1\u3009{1 0 0}, \u30081 0 0\u3009{0 1 0}, \u30080 0 1\u3009{0 1 0}, \u30081 0 0\u3009{0 0 1} and \u30080 1 0\u3009{0 0 1} slip systems are dominant in the compounds. However, in VSi 2 and CrSi 2 , the smaller C 12 and C 13 values indicate that the \u30083 3 1\u3009{0 1 3} slip system may be active, which is similar to the status of the tetragonal MoSi 2 compound [22,29] . The slip systems in these compounds are very different and the smaller shear deformation indicates that the theoretical shear stress will be reached before the crack tip stress exceeds the theoretical tensile stress. Therefore, the mechanical properties are expected to be different. As well as the moduli, the melting point is another important quantity. A higher melting temperature means greater reliability and operability for high-temperature structural materials. According to the formula given by Alouani et al. [8] and Fine et al. [30] , the melting point for tetragonal intermetallics can be calculated empirically by (7) T m = 354 + 4.5 ( 2 C 11 + C 33 ) / 3 Fig. 2 shows the results for tetragonal 3 d TMSi 2 compounds. With increasing electron numbers, the melting temperature first increases and then falls. The regularity is similar to the trends in crystal volume and moduli, indicating that changes in outer-shell electrons indeed result in variations in the macroscopic properties of materials. For CrSi 2 , its melting point is very high \u2013 up to 2114 K \u2013 slightly below that of MoSi 2 [22,29] ; however, its application as a structural material is restricted due to its brittle nature. FeSi 2 and CoSi 2 have more moderate melting temperatures, calculated to be 1673 and 1624 K, respectively. As they show excellent mechanical properties and in practice the melting temperature can be further improved by alloying and doping techniques, FeSi 2 - and CoSi 2 -based materials could potentially be used in the field of high-temperature structural materials. As the macroscopic properties are representations of the microscopic bonding, to determine the relationship between them, the electronic structures are investigated in detail in the following section. 3.3 Electronic structures The interactions in transition metal disilicides are rather complex, because the compounds not only possess covalent bonding but also have significant metallic bonding. To elucidate such interactions, two hypothetical structures are introduced, namely the transition metal atoms alone (TM sublattice) and the Si atoms alone (Si sublattice), situated as they are in tetragonal TMSi 2 compounds with the same lattice constants. Fig. 3 a shows the bonding scheme for the TM sublattice. In the {0 0 1} crystal plane, due to the 3 d xy \u20133 d xy and 3 d x 2 - y 2 \u2013 3 d x 2 - y 2 interactions among the nearest transition metal atoms, two orbital groups are separated and form the bonding and anti-bonding states, respectively. Metal\u2013metal interactions along the \u30080 0 1\u3009 direction (the z -axis) are absent because of the very large distance between them. Therefore, the 3 d xz , 3 d yz and 3 d z 2 orbitals show non-bonding characteristics. For the Si sublattice, the 3 s orbitals hybridize with 3 p z ones and form bonds along the \u30080 0 1\u3009 direction, while the 3 p x and 3 p y orbitals bend and interact with each other within the {1 1 0} and {1 \u22121 0} crystal planes. In consideration of the overlap between the two sublattices, the realistic bonding of 3 d TMSi 2 compounds can be verified, as illustrated in Fig. 3 c. For each silicon atom, three orbitals take part in the formation of covalent bonds with metal atoms, because the 3 sp z and 3 p x (3 p y ) states are symmetry-adapted with the 3 d z 2 and 3 d xz (3 d yz ) ones, respectively. However, the in-plane 3 d xy and 3 d x 2 - y 2 states possess non-bonding characteristics in the TMSi 2 systems, despite their important interactions in the TM sublattice. According to the above analysis, the changes in system bonding can be attributed to the filling of electrons in the bonding and anti-bonding states. To visualize this effect, the spin densities of states (DOSs) are calculated and depicted in Fig. 4 . It should be emphasized that the spin configurations and magnetic moments have significant impact on the mechanical properties, especially for compounds with strong magnetic ions, like Fe and Mn. In these compounds, careful treatments for obtaining the spin ground states are necessary ( Table 1S and Fig. 1S ). Furthermore, it is well known that the GGA method usually underestimates the magnetic moment of a system. Such an underestimation can be restored by the GGA + U method ( Fig. 2S ). However, as there is a lack of experiment magnetic moments, the determination of a suitable Hubbard parameter is particularly difficult. The application of the GGA + U method still has potential risks to overestimate the magnetic moments and to produce elusive mechanical properties, as demonstrated by Tables 3S and 4S . Despite this issue, the results in Fig. 4 clearly confirm that the filled DOSs below the Fermi energy are enhanced when the outer-shell electrons of transition metals increase. For one TMSi 2 formula, the maximum bonding between Si and transition metal atoms requires that all the bonding states be completely filled, corresponding to 14 electrons in total. Therefore, it is anticipated that the interactions between Si and Cr atoms in CrSi 2 are the strongest. Table 4 lists the calculated bond length and overlap population for the different kinds of bonds. The Si\u2013Si (I) and Si\u2013TM (I) bonds represent the \u03c3 interactions along the z -axis, while the Si\u2013Si (II) and Si\u2013TM (II) bonds represent the \u03c3 ones within the {1 1 0} and {1 \u22121 0} crystal planes, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Since the Si\u2013TM(I) and Si\u2013TM(II) interactions in ScSi 2 , TiSi 2 and VSi 2 are weaker than that of CrSi 2 , their lattice constants and crystal volumes are expected to be larger, as confirmed by the results listed in Table 1 . For the rest of the TMSi 2 compounds, the weaker Si\u2013TM interactions with respect to CrSi 2 result in a continuous increase in lattice constant a ( b ) and an irregular change in c , and their lattice volumes still show a decreasing trend as the outer-shell electrons increase. As the ionic bonding properties are very interesting, the effective charges for Si and metal atoms based on the Mulliken scheme [31] are also provided in Table 4 . The effective ionic valence, defined as the difference between the formal ionic charge and the Mulliken charge on the anion [32] , can thus be produced. In consideration of the bonding directionalities, the relationship between macroscopic mechanical properties and microscopic bonding can be further interpreted. In the compounds, the Si\u2013Si (I) and Si\u2013TM (I) bonds (type I) are parallel to the \u30080 0 1\u3009 direction, while the Si\u2013Si (II) and Si\u2013TM (II) (type II) bonds intersect with the \u30080 0 1\u3009 direction at a certain angle and are within the {1 1 0} and {1 \u22121 0} planes. The two kinds of bonds actually reflect the deformation conditions along the z -axis and the x ( y )-axis, respectively. The calculated overlap populations clearly show that type I bonds are much stronger than type II bonds. Therefore, the elastic deformations along the \u30080 0 1\u3009 directions should be much smaller, being consistent with the calculated C 11 , C 33 and Young\u2019s modulus listed in Table 2 . As well as the C 11 , C 33 , E x and E z values, the overlap populations also provide useful information for evaluating the shear components. For the cleavage or slip system concerning the {0 0 1} crystal plane, two different patterns, shown in Fig. 1 b, should be considered. The behaviors about the Si\u2013Si interface are related to the Si\u2013TM (I), Si\u2013Si (II) and Si\u2013TM (I) bonds, while those about the Si\u2013TM interface are determined by the Si\u2013Si (I), Si\u2013TM (II) and Si\u2013TM (I) bonds. It can be confirmed that type I bonds play dominant roles in the cleavage and shear deformation behaviors of the {0 0 1} plane. To prevent cleavage, the interactions within the {0 0 1} interface should be as strong as possible and the electron density should be distributed homogeneously across the interface. For VSi 2 and CrSi 2 compounds, although the Si\u2013TM (I) bonds are very strong, the Si\u2013Si (I) bonds are rather weak. The calculated overlap populations indicate that the former is twice as large as the latter. As a result, the electron density distributions on the two corresponding interfaces differ greatly, and the breakage of the Si\u2013Si (I) bonds results in the preferential cleavage of the Si\u2013TM interface. VSi 2 and CrSi 2 thus possess brittle characteristics, as confirmed by the calculated G / B ratio. The situation in FeSi 2 and CoSi 2 is different, with the overlap populations of Si\u2013Si (I) bonds being almost identical to those of Si\u2013TM (I) bonds. The moderate bonding strength for the type I bonds and the uniform distributions of electron density on the two interfaces indicate that the slip of {0 0 1} crystal planes occurs preferentially over the cleavage process. Therefore, tetragonal FeSi 2 and CoSi 2 show excellent ductility, which is consistent with the above-predicted mechanical properties. It should be emphasized that the impact of phase transitions on the bonding and mechanical properties is another important issue when considering the practical application of TMSi 2 compounds as high-temperature structural materials. Much effort is still needed to solve this problem. However, the present calculations at least indicate that the bonding and mechanical properties can be changed in response to the outer-shell electrons of transition metals. 4 Conclusions Relying on the first-principles technique, we have investigated the stabilities, mechanical properties and electronic structures of tetragonal 3 d TMSi 2 compounds. For some early and late 3 d transition metals (Ti, Ni, Cu, Zn), the corresponding tetragonal disilicides are either thermodynamically or mechanically unstable. When the outer-shell electrons of transition metals increase, the crystal volume and melting point of the compounds first increase and then fall. By computing the elastic constants and moduli, it can be confirmed that for a stable structure C 33 and E z are much larger than C 11 and E x ( E y ), indicating that the resistance to elastic deformation along the \u30080 0 1\u3009 direction is much stronger. According to the G / B ratio, two kinds of compounds are classified. Tetragonal VSi 2 and CrSi 2 are very brittle, while FeSi 2 and CoSi 2 possess excellent ductility. These very different mechanical properties can be attributed to the filling of the outer-shell electrons of transition metals in the bonding and anti-bonding states of compounds. The DOSs and overlap populations further confirm that type I bonds are not only responsible for the Young\u2019s modulus along the \u30080 0 1\u3009 direction but also crucial for the C 66 shear component, while type II bonds are responsible for E x ( E y ) and C 44 . The bonding strength and the electron density distributions of the {0 0 1} interface are also important for clarifying the ductility and brittleness of tetragonal TMSi 2 compounds, since they determine whether cleavage or the slip process is more favorable.

        "abstract": "Composite magnetic nanoparticles, Fe3O4@Au, were synthesized in an aqueous phase via reducing gold chloride acid (HAuCl4) in-situ on (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane layer around Fe3O4 nanostructures. Connection between gold and Fe3O4 was confirmed by the magnetic separa- tion technique and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation revealed that the gold nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Significantly, aqueous dispersion of such composite nanoparticles exhibited surface plasmon of Au nanoparticles. The composite magnetic nanoparticles were then modified with 3-mercaptopropionic via an Au-S bond. These ligand-modified nanoparticles were facilely conjugated to anti-penicillin antibody. The resulting Fe3O4@Au-antibody conjugates were successfully used as a powerful sandwich element and an excellent amplification reagent for surface plasmon resonance based sandwich immunoassay. By the amplification effect of Fe3O4 @ Au-antibody conjugates, there was a nearly 30-fold increase in signal and penicillin in aqueous solution was detected at a lowest detection limit of 5 ng/ml. The biological properties of the Fe3O4@Au-antibody conjugates were investigated by Western Blotting. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the in-situ synthesis of monodisperse Au nanoparticles on Fe3O4 magnetic nanostructures in an aqueous solution with surface plasmon resonance amplification.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A facile and efficient approach to prepare uniform gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) in hybrid hydrogel consisting of acrylamide (AM) and alginate (SA) for antibacterial applications is reported. In this study, reduction of gold ions by acrylamide and alginate (AM\u2013SA) occurred before the polymerization and as-obtained gold colloids are stabilized by AM\u2013SA immediately in the absence of commonly used reducing agents and protective reagents. Via transmittance electron microscopy results, we can conclude that the obtained gold nanoparticles in hydrogel are well dispersed. Furthermore, ultraviolet\u2013visible absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric analysis were used to characterize the structure and composition of the synthetic nanocomposites. Our approach provides well-dispersed nanoparticles around 8 mm in size. It is important to underline that nanoparticle aggregation was not observed during and after gel formation. The prepared Au NPs exhibited remarkable stability in the presence of high pH s, and a range of salt concentrations. Importantly, the hydrogel/gold nanocomposites showed a non-compromised activity to inhibit the growth of a model bacterium, Escherichia coli. With their excellent mechanical behavior, as well as the remained antibacterial activity, the nanocomposites should get various potential applications in the fields of pharmaceutical science and tissue engineering.",

Due to the self-assembling behavior of PrP on gold surface, the non-modified gold surface can be directly used as sensing surface for the quick detection, for the purpose to avoid the interference from the traditional, complex and changeable probe-modified sensing surface. And due to the highly specific affinity of AGO towards PrP, the sandwich type SPR sensor exhibits excellent analytical performance towards the discrimination and quantitation of PrP. A good linear relationship was obtained between SPR responses and the logarithm of PrP concentrations over a range of 0.001-1ng/mL. The detection sensitivity for PrP was improved by \u223c156 orders of AGO compared with SPR direct detection format. Besides, morphological changes of the sensing film surfaces were investigated by high resolution AFM imaging, confirming the capture of PrP molecules and their further specific recognition by AGO. The specificity of the present biosensor was also investigated by PrP and other regents as controls. By compared with other reported methods, the AGO enhanced sandwich SPR assay was confirmed to be efficient, sensitive, and with wide working range.",

        "abstract": "Quantum dots (QDs) have attracted great attention due to their unique optical properties. High fluorescence efficiency is very important for their practical application. In this study, we report a simple and efficient strategy to enhance the photoluminescence of water-dispersed thiol-capped QDs using \u03b3-radiation. Three kinds of QDs with different surface ligands and cores (MPA-CdTe, MPA-CdSe and Cys-CdTe) were fabricated and irradiated by high-energy \u03b3-ray in an aqueous solution. Their photoluminescence intensities were significantly enhanced after irradiation, which were closely related to the radiation dose and the structure of QDs. The positions of the fluorescence emission peaks did not shift obviously after irradiation. The mechanism of photoluminescence enhancement was discussed based on the results of photoluminescence (PL) spectra, UV-visible light absorption (UV-vis) spectra, transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This method can be employed to uniformly treat large batches of QDs at room temperature and without other chemicals.",

        "abstract": "Radiotherapy is one of the most widely used treatments for therapy of malignant tumors, but resistance to radiation of hypoxic cells in tumor tissues is still a serious concern. Previous studies have demonstrated that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) enhance the radiosensitivity of human glioma cells in vitro, but the effect of AgNPs on hypoxic glioma cells has not been investigated in detail. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the radiosensitizing efficacy of AgNPs on hypoxic glioma cells. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of AgNPs for the hypoxic U251 cells and C6 cells were 30.32\u2009\u03bcg/mL and 27.53\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively. The sensitization enhancement ratio (SER) demonstrated that AgNPs exhibit higher capacity in radiosensitization in hypoxic cells (U251: 1.78; C6: 1.84) than that in normoxic cells (U251: 1.34; C6: 1.45). The underlying mechanism of AgNPs' radiosensitization in hypoxic cells is through the promotion of apoptosis and enhanced destructive autophagy. There is evidence of crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy in AgNPs-radiosensitized hypoxic cells where inhibition of autophagy results in decreased apoptosis. These findings suggest that AgNPs can be used as a highly effective nano-radiosensitizer for the treatment of hypoxic glioma.",

The Co/\u03b3-Al 2O 3 catalysts modified with the natural mixed rare earths were synthesized by the impregnation method, and characterized via ICP, BET, XRD, H 2-TPR, TEM and TG-DSC techniques. The result showed that the addition of mixed rare earths enhanced the anti-sintering ability of metallic cobalt after reduction and improved anti-coke performance of the catalysts via the synergic effect of mixed rare earths. The 20% Co/\u03b3-Al 2O 3 catalyst promoted by the appropriate natural mixed rare earths exhibited good activity and stability with low carbon formation at 800 \u00b0C for 320 h reaction.

The CeO 2 -promoted catalysts with CeO 2 /ZrO 2  ratios of 5\u00a0wt% and 10\u00a0wt% (denoted as 5 and 10) were prepared by the sequential incipient wetness method. The catalysts and/or supports were characterized by N 2  adsorption-desorption, XRD, TEM, TPR, XPS, and hydrogen chemisorption techniques. The experimental results indicated that an appropriate amount of CeO 2  promoter added to Co/ZrO 2  catalyst could increase the active sites of the catalysts due to the increase of reducibility and dispersion, thus further lead to a high FTS activity. In the meantime, CeO 2  promoter could effectively inhibit water re-oxidation as well as further the aggregation of cobalt metal particles during the reaction. Therefore, CeO 2 -modified Co/ZrO 2  catalysts displayed a better performance against deactivation in the FTS reaction.",

Given the limited peptide length offered by solid-phase peptide synthesis invented by Professor Merrifield, peptide ligation plays a key role in long peptide or protein synthesis by ligating two small peptides to a long one. Moreover, high-molecular-weight proteins must be synthesized using two or more peptide ligation steps, and sequential peptide ligation is such an efficient way. In this paper, we reviewed the development of chemical protein synthesis, including solid-phase peptide synthesis, chemical ligation, and sequential chemical ligation.",

        "abstract": "Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) are cysteine proteases which break Asx (Asn/Asp)-Xaa bonds in acidic conditions. Despite sharing a conserved overall structure with AEPs, certain plant enzymes such as butelase 1 act as a peptide asparaginyl ligase (PAL) and catalyze Asx-Xaa bond formation in near-neutral conditions. PALs also serve as macrocyclases in the biosynthesis of cyclic peptides. Here, we address the question of how a PAL can function as a ligase rather than a protease. Based on sequence homology of butelase 1, we identified AEPs and PALs from the cyclic peptide-producing plants  () and  () of the Violaceae family. Using a crystal structure of a PAL obtained at 2.4-\u00c5 resolution coupled to mutagenesis studies, we discovered ligase-activity determinants flanking the S1 site, namely LAD1 and LAD2 located around the S2 and S1' sites, respectively, which modulate ligase activity by controlling the accessibility of water or amine nucleophile to the -ester intermediate. Recombinantly expressed PAL1-3, predicted to be PALs, were confirmed to be ligases by functional studies. In addition, mutagenesis studies on PAL1-3, AEP1, and AEP supported our prediction that LAD1 and LAD2 are important for ligase activity. In particular, mutagenesis targeting LAD2 selectively enhanced the ligase activity of PAL3 and converted the protease AEP into a ligase. The definition of structural determinants required for ligation activity of the asparaginyl ligases presented here will facilitate genomic identification of PALs and engineering of AEPs into PALs.",

Our work in the past 4\u00a0years has validated that butelase 1 is a potent and versatile tool for peptide and protein modification. Here we describe our protocols using butelase 1 for efficient and site-specific peptide and protein ligation, N-terminal labeling, preparation of thioesters, and bioconjugation of dendrimers.

Apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100)-derived peptide fragments generated by proteolytic degradation and aldehyde modification are the major antigens in oxLDL, and so the present work was undertaken to detect circulating IgG for Apo-B100-derived peptide antigens. An in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed with eight ApoB100-derived peptide antigens (Ag1-Ag8) to detect circulating anti-ApoB100 IgG levels in 267 patients with AMI and 201 control subjects. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that circulating IgG for Ag1 was significantly higher in the patient group than the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) after adjustment for age, gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and circulating levels of cholesterol, HDL, LDL, ApoA and ApoB100. None of the other seven antigens detected an increase in IgG levels in AMI patients compared with control subjects. Spearman correlation analysis showed no correlation between IgG antibody for Ag1 and clinical characteristics. In conclusion, the linear peptide antigens derived from ApoB100 may be suitable for the development of an ELISA antibody test for prediction of AMI, although further confirmation is still needed in large-scale clinical studies.

In general, our case-control study is to detect the association between MALAT1 (rs619586, rs4102217) SNPs and CAD risk.365 CAD patients and 384 matched control participants blood samples were collected in Liaoning province, China. Two polymorphisms (rs619586, rs4102217) in lncRNA MALAT1 were genotyped by KASP platform.In a stratified analysis, we found that non-drinkers with GC genotype and the recessive model of rs4102217 had higher CAD risk (  =0.010, OR:1.96, 95%CI = 1.17-3.28;  =0.026, OR:1.73, 95%CI =1.07-2.79) and diabetes mellitus (DM) history group (  =0.010, OR:4.07, 95%CI=1.41-11.81;  =0.019, OR:3.29, 95%CI=1.22-8.88). In SNP-SNP interactions analysis between MALAT1 and CAD risk, we found rs4102217 had an increase in smokers (GG: OR: 2.04, 95%CI=1.42-2.92; CC+GC: OR: 2.64, 95%CI=1.64-4.26) and a decrease in drinkers (CC+GC: OR: 0.33, 95%CI=0.20-0.55). Smokers with MALAT1 rs619586 AA genotype (OR: 2.20, 95%CI=1.57-3.07) and GG+AG genotype (OR: 2.11, 95%CI=1.17-3.81) had a higher risk of CAD. Moreover, drinkers with AA genotype (OR: 0.22, 95%CI=0.10-0.48) and GG+AG genotype (OR: 0.38, 95%CI=0.22-0.65) had a lower risk of CAD. According to the MDR software, MALAT1 rs4102217 polymorphism-smoking-drinking was the best interaction model, which has higher risk of CAD (Testing Bal.ACC. = 0.6979).\u00a0Our study demonstrated that the GC genotype and the recessive model of rs4102217 potentially increased CAD risk in some specific group.",

Firstly, we proposed some new operational rules for the IULVs which can overcome the weaknesses of the existing operations. Then, we extended BM operator to the IULVs and developed intuitionistic uncertain linguistic arithmetic Bonferroni mean (IULABM) operator, intuitionistic uncertain linguistic arithmetic weighted Bonferroni mean (IULWABM) operator, intuitionistic uncertain linguistic geometric Bonferroni mean (IULGBM) operator, and intuitionistic uncertain linguistic weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (IULWGBM) operator. At the same time, some desirable properties of the proposed operators, such as idempotency, boundedness, and monotonicity, were studied, and some special cases of these operators were analyzed. Moreover, some approaches based on the developed operators are proposed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the steps of the developed methods and to discuss the influences of different parameters on the decision-making results.",

        "abstract": "The intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) is an effective tool to express uncertain and incomplete cognitive information with the membership, non-membership, and hesitance degrees. The picture fuzzy set (PFS) is an extension of IFS, and it can contain more information than IFS. Linguistic variables (LVs) can easily describe the complex cognitive information provided by the decision makers. So it is necessary to combine the PFS with the linguistic term and define the picture fuzzy linguistic set (PFLS), then extend Archimedean triangular norms (t-norms) and triangular conorms (s-norms), which are the generalizations of a number of other t-norms and s-norms, such as Einstein, Hamacher, and Frank s-norms and t-norms, to process PFLS. By combining the PFS and the linguistic term, we define the picture fuzzy linguistic set (PFLS) and the operations of the picture fuzzy linguistic numbers (PFLNs). Further, we develop the Archimedean picture fuzzy linguistic weighted arithmetic averaging (A-PFLWAA) operator and discuss a number of properties and special cases of this operator. Besides, we propose an approach to deal with multiple attributes group decision-making (MAGDM) problem on the basis of the developed A-PFLWAA operator. An approach to solve MAGDM problem is proposed on the basis of the A-PFLWAA operator, and the validity and reliability of the proposed method are proven by an illustrative example. The PFLNs are the generalizations of the intuitionistic linguistic numbers (ILNs), and they contain more information than ILNs. In addition, our method cannot only be utilized to solve the problems with ILNs but also be used to deal with the problems with PFLNs, and it is a generalization of a number of the existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Considering the limitations of the applications of a Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DSET) in multiple attributes decision-making (MADM) and the defects of the existing MADM methods with intuitionistic linguistic numbers (ILNs), in this paper, we propose a new MADM approach. First, we provide a method to translate the evaluation values denoted by ILNs into the mass functions (MFs) under the framework of DSET. Second, we calculate the subjective weights of attributes based on the AHP method. Then, we propose a new definition of fuzzy entropy (FE) for ILNs and the objective weights of attributes are calculated by the defined FE. Moreover, we develop a linear objective programming model to obtain the comprehensive weights of attributes based on the obtained subjective and objective weights of attributes. Third, we introduce some procedures to modify the MFs of alternatives on each attribute. On these bases, a new DSET-based MADM approach with ILNs is presented. Furthermore, an application example of hotel selection is used to illustrate the presented approach. At last, some comparative analyses with other MADM methods are conducted to show the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach.",

This study starts with an examination of the impacts of irrigation frequency, irrigation water sources, and irrigation water supply performance on crop yield and net crop revenue, using data from a survey of 182 households in the study area. Thereafter, it analyzes the impact of agricultural water reallocation (AWR) on crop yield and revenue. The study ends with an estimation of the compensation for affected farmers and a discussion of the compensation methods. Regression results indicate that irrigation frequency shows a significantly positive impact on crop yield and net crop revenue. The change of irrigation water source from canal water to well water and local small river water decreases the integrated crop yield of wheat and rice by 9% and 12%, and decreases the net integrated crop revenue by 16% and 19%, respectively. AWR decreases the integrated crop yield of wheat and rice by at least 2%, and decreases the net integrated crop revenue by at least 3.5%. Estimated compensation for affected farmers is between 78.72 and 97.85 USD/ha.",

        "abstract": "A comparison between gross irrigation water use (GIWU) in fields and allocated irrigation water rights amount (AIWA) is critical for evaluating any system of water rights allocation. GIWU in fields under different precipitation probabilities has been rarely calculated and compared with AIWA using households\u2019 survey data. This study developed a method for calculating the GIWU of crops under different precipitation probabilities using field survey data from 391 households and the monitoring data of wells in Chengan County, China. AIWA was compared with the calculated GIWU and irrigation quota. Results showed that AIWA is too small to satisfy the GIWU of the principle crops. The GIWU of main cropping patterns under a precipitation probability of 75% was curtailed between 43 and 77% to fulfill AIWA. AIWA cannot support any cropping patterns when precipitation is lower than the precipitation percentile of 75%. In this condition, farmers are restricted to planting apples, cotton, and sweet potatoes. The uncertainty in precipitation was not fully considered, and the participation of farmers in water rights allocation in Chengan County was limited, which may adversely influence the income and food security of farmers.",

        "abstract": "The site preference, the electronic structure and the magnetic properties of Co2ZrGe have been studied by using first-principles calculations, and the stabilities of the Cu2MnAl-type and the Hg2CuTi-type structures have been tested in this respect. The Cu2MnAltype structure is more favorable than the Hg2CuTitype structure for the Co2ZrGe compound, and the equilibrium lattice parameter of the Cu2MnAltype Co2ZrGe alloy is 6.06 \u00c5. The Co2ZrGe alloy is found to have an energy gap in the minority spin direction at the Fermi level (E  F ) and the majority spin band shows strongly metallic characteristic. As a result, the Co2ZrGe alloy is predicted to be a half-metal with 100% spin polarization of the conduction electrons at the E  F . The calculated total magnetic moment is 2.00\u00b5 B  per unit cell, which is in line with the Slater-Pauling curve of M t  = Z t  \u2212 24. The Co atom-projected spin moment is 1.02\u00b5 B , which mainly determines the total moment. Simultaneously, the Zr and the Ge atom moments are \u22120.08\u00b5 B  and 0.04\u00b5 B , respectively. The Co2ZrGe alloy may be a promising material for application in future spintronics devices.",

A Periodic Adaptive Extended State Observer (PAESO) consisting of a normal Extended State Observer (ESO) and a refined ESO is proposed. The normal ESO is designed to capture the approximate range of the disturbances, and the refined ESO is developed to optimize the quantity of the estimated lumped disturbances by integrating real-time position tracking error. Based on PAESO, a hybrid controller, including a feedback branch and a feedforward branch, is presented to make the overall system stable and the position tracking error convergent towards zero.

Results The accordance rate was 77.9% between the ultras-onography and pathological results of metastatic lymph nodes.The metastasis existed in the lymph nodes with the sonographic features, which were a less than 2 ratio of long to short axis,absence of an echogenic hilum,microcalcification,cystis degeneration and affluent vascular pattern. The differences between the malignant and benign hyperplastic groups for all the above-mentioned index was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The blood flow peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistance index (RI) in malignant groups were significantly higher than those in benign hyperplastic groups ( P < 0.05).

When a device has problems or notices improper operation, it can make a device diagnosis request in the consortium blockchain network, and receive a diagnosis response from a vendor or non-original supplier nodes. This scheme designs a decentralized safety equipment diagnosis smart contract, combining response node bid price and credit, and applies a multi-dimensional reverse auction mechanism to determine bid node and transaction price. After a smart device diagnosed, the relevant message will be packaged and sent to a smartphone, which can use the client to set up the smart contract of equipment operation policy.

        "title": "Abstract POSTER-CTRL-1202: Suppression of cytokine expression and ovarian cancer invasion to omentum by vitamin D",
        "abstract": "Purpose:  Ovarian cancer (OCa) is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers, mainly because the disease, in most cases, has progressed to advanced stages when it is diagnosed. Our published studies have established a role for 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) and its receptors (VDR) in suppressing ovarian tumor growth. The purpose of the present studies is to investigate the effect of the hormone and its receptors on OCa invasion.   Approaches:  Our microarray analyses have identified a group of cytokines of which the expression was suppressed by 1,25D3. Molecular analyses were used to define the mechanisms underlying the cytokine suppression. Trans-well assays were used to measure the  in vitro  effect of 1,25D3 on OCa invasion and migration.  Ex vivo  omental organ co-culturing with luciferase-marked human OCa cells was developed to investigate the effect of 1,25D3 and VDR on the ability of OCa cells to invade omentum. Syngeneic ovarian tumor models in VDR null mice were established to test the effect of stromal VDR in controlling OCa invasion  in vivo .   Data Summary:  Mechanistic studies showed that the suppression of cytokine expression by 1,25D3 was mediated through NF\u03baB inhibition. In trans-well assays, 1,25D3 treatment decreased the OCa motility and invasion through matrigel and VDR knockdown diminished such an effect. In  ex vivo  mouse models, the absence of the VDR in either the tumor cells or omentum resulted in increased invasiveness of OCa cells into omental tissues. In  in vivo  studies with syngeneic tumor models, mouse ovarian tumors invaded into omentum much more rapidly in VDR null than wild type mice, showing a role for stromal VDR in OCa invasion. Moreover, stable expression of constitutive IKK\u03b2 or the addition of recombinant cytokines in the culture medium relieved the suppressive effect of 1,25D3 on OCa migration and invasion, identifying the suppression of cytokine expression and NF\u03baB activity as the main mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of 1,25D3 on OCa invasion.   Conclusions:  This is the first demonstration of an important role of 1,25D3 in suppressing cytokine expression and ovarian tumor invasion into omentum. The studies are also the first to define a role for both tumor and stromal VDR in the suppression. The studies support a VDR-based therapeutic strategy that will allow the use of 1,25D3 or its analogs to improve the poor clinical outcomes for patients with invasive OCa. The main findings of the present study is that the VDR acts as a suppressor of ovarian tumor invasion and thus represents a novel molecular drug target for the intervention of invasive OCa.

In our studies, RIPK1 decreased the transcriptional activity of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in luciferase reporter assays independent of its kinase activity, suggesting a negative role of RIPK1 in 1,25D3 action. RIPK1 also formed a complex with VDR, and deletion analyses mapped the RIPK1 binding region to the C-terminal ligand-binding domain of the VDR. Subcellular fractionation analyses indicated that RIPK1 increased VDR retention in the cytoplasm, which may account for its inhibition of VDR transcriptional activity. Consistent with the reporter analyses, 1,25D3-induced growth suppression was more pronounced in RIPK1-null MEFs and RIPK1-knockdown ovarian cancer cells than in control cells. Our studies have defined RIPK1 as a VDR repressor, projecting RIPK1 depletion as a potential strategy to increase the potency of 1,25D3 and its analogs for cancer intervention.",

        "abstract": "Abstract MSH2 is a key DNA mismatch repair protein, which plays an important role in genomic stability. In addition to its DNA repair function, MSH2 serves as a sensor for DNA base analogs-provoked DNA replication errors and binds to various DNA damage-induced adducts to trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Loss or depletion of MSH2 from cells renders resistance to certain DNA-damaging agents. Therefore, the level of MSH2 determines DNA damage response. Previous studies showed that the level of MSH2 protein is modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) serves as an ubiquitin E3 ligase. However, the deubiquitinating enzymes, which regulate MSH2 remain unknown. Here we report that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) interacts with and stabilizes MSH2. USP10 deubiquitinates MSH2 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the protein level of MSH2 is positively correlated with the USP10 protein level in a panel of lung cancer cell lines. Knockdown of USP10 in lung cancer cells exhibits increased cell survival and decreased apoptosis upon the treatment of DNA-methylating agent N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and antimetabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TG). The above phenotypes can be rescued by ectopic expression of MSH2. In addition, knockdown of MSH2 decreases the cellular mismatch repair activity. Overall, our results suggest a novel USP10-MSH2 pathway regulating DNA damage response and DNA mismatch repair.",

The synthesis processes involve the repeated anion exchange reaction with Na 2 S and the controllable etching using hydrochloric acid. The whole synthesis processes are well revealed and the obtained double-shell CuS is tested as pseudocapacitive electrode material for supercapacitors. As expected, the CuS double-shell hollow nanocages deliver high specific capacitance, good rate performance and excellent cycling stability due to their unique nano-architecture. The present work contributes greatly to the exploration of hollow metal sulfides with complex architecture and non-spherical shape, as well as their promising application in high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors.",

We give a simple eigenvalue characterization for when such a graph has perfect state transfer at time    \u03c0  /  2   ; this characterization allows one to choose the correct eigenvalues to build graphs having perfect state transfer. We characterize the graphs that are diagonalizable by the standard Hadamard matrix, showing a direct relationship to cubelike graphs. We then give a number of constructions producing a wide variety of new graphs that exhibit perfect state transfer, and we consider several corollaries in the settings of both weighted and unweighted graphs, as well as how our results relate to the notion of pretty good state transfer.

Unweighted paths are of limited use, and so a natural generalization is to consider weighted paths; this has been further generalized to allow for loops (potentials in the physics literature). We study the particularly important situation of perfect state transfer with respect to the corresponding adjacency matrix or Laplacian through the use of orthogonal polynomials. Low-dimensional examples are given in detail. Our main result is that PST with respect to the Laplacian matrix cannot occur for weighted paths on n\u22653 vertices nor can it occur for certain symmetric weighted trees. The methods used lead us to a conjecture directly linking the rationality of the weights of weighted paths on nu003e3 vertices, with or without loops, with the capacity for PST between the end vertices with respect to the adjacency matrix.",

In particular, these switched and partially switched perturbations of the $n$-cube exhibit perfect state transfer (PST, a desirable property in quantum information theory) between certain pairs of vertices. We also consider convex combinations of graphs with PST, as well as switched systems of the aforementioned graphs. We analyse which pairs of vertices retain PST after the perturbations, and show that the sensitivity with respect to readout time errors remains unaffected for some pairs of vertices.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, we have successfully established a novel method of haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) without in vitro T-cell depletion. This study was aimed at analysing the incidence and risk factors of invasive fungal infection (IFI) with this transplantation method. The study comprised 291 patients who had undergone haploidentical HSCT from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008. IFI was diagnosed according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group 2002 criteria, and only proven or probable cases of IFI were regarded as true cases. A total of 39 patients were documented as having IFI, including four proven cases and 35 probable cases. The median time of diagnosis was 26 days (range: 6-405 days) after transplantation. The cumulative incidence rates of IFI at 40 days, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years after transplantation were 8.25%, 13.1%, 13.4% and 13.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified platelet engraftment time (>17 days) (p 0.027; hazard ratio (HR) 2.432; 95% CI 1.105-5.355), a high risk of underlying disease (p 0.001; HR 2.916; 95% CI 1.515-5.611) and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (p 0.019; HR 2.407; 95% CI 1.154-5.022) as risk factors for IFI. The incidence rates of IFI in patients with no, one, two or three risk factors at 3 years after transplantation were 4.48%, 7.86%, 29.6% and 23.1%, respectively. In conclusion, IFI is an important complication following haploidentical HSCT without in vitro T-cell depletion.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, clinical features and outcome of invasive fungal disease (IFD) after either unmanipulated haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling HSCT. This was a head-to-head comparative study performed at a single centre. Patients were admitted between 2007 and 2010, and IFD was evaluated according to the revised EORTC/MSG criteria, with only proven and probable cases included. Of the 1042 consecutive patients enrolled, 390 received the HLA-matched HSCT and 652 received unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT. A total of 61 (5.8%) patients had IFD, including 15 proven cases and 46 probable cases. The incidence of IFD after unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT was significantly higher than that after HLA-matched transplantation (7.1% vs. 3.3%, respectively; p 0.007). IFD occurred later in patients receiving HLA-matched transplantation compared with patients receiving unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT (141.5 vs. 23 days, respectively; p 0.04). In multivariate analysis, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades III to IV (HR = 2.214, 95% CI, 1.139-4.304; p 0.019), extensive chronic GVHD (HR = 2.413, 95% CI, 1.377-4.228; p 0.002) and haploidentical transplantation (HR = 2.648, 95% CI, 1.111-6.310; p 0.028) were identified as significant risk factors associated with IFD. The response to antifungal therapy and the IFD-attributable mortality were similar between the two types of transplantation. In conclusion, patients who received unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT had a higher risk of IFD than those patients who received HLA-matched HSCT, but the prognosis of IFD was not associated with the HLA type.",

        "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most prevalent human cancers, which is known for local growth, easily migration, long-distance invasion and reoccurrence. Targeted ultrasound (US) contrast combined with ultrasound for lung cancer diagnosis has been applied in the clinic. In the present study, a novel targeted ultrasound contrast agent containing chistosan/FeO-parceled bispecific antibody (TcBab) targeting carcino-embryonic antigen, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor was introduced, and the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity was investigated in patients with NSCLC. A total of 384 patients with suspected NSCLC were recruited to investigate the accuracy of TcBab-ultrasound (TcBab-US) and ultrasound. Results demonstrated that TcBab-US improved sensitivity and may provide a novel protocol for diagnosing tumors in patients with suspected NSCLC at an early stage. Data analysis demonstrated that TcBab-US diagnosed 154 suspected patients with NSCLC, whereas ultrasound only diagnosed 84 suspected patients with NSCLC out of a total of 384 patients with suspected NSCLC (P<0.01). A dosage experiment revealed that the optimal dose of TcBab was 5 mg/kg for NSCLC patients. Pharmacodynamics analysis showed that TcBab may be metabolized within 16 h in serum of patients. Notably, early diagnosis determined by TcBab-US contributed to improvement of survival for NSCLC patients as determined by a comparison of the survival rate with the survival rate of patients who did not receive TcBab (P<0.05). In conclusion, these investigations suggested that TcBab improves the accuracy and diagnostic confidence of ultrasonic for the diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC, and may have potential application value in the clinic.",

High intensity ultrasonic treatments that are used to treat solid cancers are not much successful in differentiating between healthy and cancerous cells. In this study, a method of combining ultrasound treatment with Garcinia mangostana bark extract mediated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was extended by making use of human lung epithelial cells, that could preferentially destruct the cancerous cells. Flow cytometry analysis is used to study the effect of ultrasound and AgNPs on cancerous (A549) cell lines and healthy (BEAS-2B) lung cells by means of counting viable cells (Q4). These experimental data showed a minor decline in the percentage of living cells from (66.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.2) to (56\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.2) % after the addition of bark extract synthesized AgNPs to the US-treated normal BEAS- 2B cell lines. However, the percentage of live A549 cancer cells presented a significant reduction from (61.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.2) % for US-treated cells to (28.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.4) % for the combination treatment of US with AgNPs. This study conducted against various cell lines denoted that nanoparticle-assisted ultrasound therapy (NAUT) could serve as an effective novel means for targeted destruction of cancer cells.",

        "abstract": ": Recent research has indicated that altered promoter methylation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in lung cancer development and progression. In this study, we investigated the association between promoter methylation of , a possible inhibitor of the Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling, and the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). : Twelve pairs of tumor and adjacent non-tumor samples were used for microarray analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression. For validation, more than two hundred additional samples were analyzed for methylation using bisulfite pyrosequencing and for gene expression using qRT-PCR. Then the cell function were tested by wound healing, transwell, CCK8 and cell cycle assay. : Our analysis of patient specimens showed that  methylation was higher in NSCLC tumors (82.2% \u00b1 10.3,  < 0.01) compared with the adjacent normal tissues (65.9% \u00b1 7.2). The survival analysis revealed that patients with high  methylation had a shorter overall survival (46 months) compared with patients with low  methylation (>56 months;=0.021). In addition, we found that demethylation treatment could inhibit tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which was supportive of an association between methylation and survival. : Based on these consistent observations, we concluded that  may play an important role in NSCLC progression and that promoter methylation of  may serve as a biomarker for NSCLC prognosis and treatment.",

In our previousstudies, we identified a lncRNA, ENST00000439577, which is highly expressed in lung carcinomas, and termed it lung cancerprogression-associated transcript 1 (LCPAT1). To characterize the role of LCPAT1 in lung cancer, we conducted the current study.  Methods: Expression of LCPAT1 and autophagy-associated markers in tumor tissues and lung cancer cell lines was determined byreal-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, qPCR, Western blot, andimmunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate xenografted tumor tissues. Autophagy induced by rapamycin was detected byWestern blot and immunofluorescence in lung cancer cell lines.  Results: Expression of LCPAT1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B) was positively correlated in lungcancer. Knockdown of LCPAT1 inhibited tumor growth and suppressed cell autophagy in vivo. Moreover, LCPAT1 knockdown inlung cancer cell lines resulted in decreased autophagy-associated gene expression and alleviated the cell autophagy induced byrapamycin.  Conclusions: We speculate that LCPAT1 plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy in lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "The optimal treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is unclear owing to its limited geographic distribution. Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon \u03b1-2a (180 \u03bcg/week) and ribavirin (800-1,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (<50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings.Twenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01263860.",

        "abstract": "Aim. Our aim is to survey the treatment effect of PEG-IFN plus ribavirin in patients infected with HCV genotype 6a in Guangdong and Guangxi province of China and investigate best course of antiviral treatment for patients with HCV-6a infection. Methods. 515 eligible patients received subcutaneous 180\u2009\u03bcg PEG-IFN\u03b1-2a or 1.5\u2009\u03bcg/kg PEG-IFN\u03b1-2b once weekly plus oral ribavirin. Primary outcome was SVR by intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcome was RVR, cEVR, ETR, and relapse rate. Results. SVR in patients with HCV-6a infection treated for 48 weeks was comparable to that in patients with HCV-2/3 infection (80.9% versus 82.5%, p = 0.812) and higher than that in patients with HCV-1b infection (80.9% versus 67.2%, p = 0.014). ETR (98.9% versus 90.6%, p = 0.016), virological response at month 3 of end-of- treatment (88.8% versus 76.6%, p = 0.044), SVR (80.9% versus 65.6%, p = 0.032), and virological response at month 12 of end-of-treatment (76.4% versus 60.9%, p = 0.04) in patients with HCV-6a infection treated for 48 weeks were higher than those in patients with HCV-6a infection treated for 24 weeks. Conclusion. SVR in patients with HCV-6a treated for 48 weeks was comparable to that in patients with HCV-2/3 infection and higher than that in patients with HCV-1b infection; patients with HCV-6a infection treated for 48 weeks had a superior treatment response than patients treated for 24 weeks.

        "abstract": "Currently, hepatitis C antiviral therapy is entering a new era with the use of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). However, the precise immunological influences of DAA therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients are insufficiently understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of DAA therapy on the frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells in CHC patients. Thirty-two treatment-naive CHC patients were treated with DAA therapy, and the frequency of immune cells was analysed by flow cytometry at various time points during and after therapy. Sixteen healthy donors were recruited for comparison. DAA therapy decreased the frequency of MDSCs and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) in CHC patients to a normal level. DAA therapy also increased the CD8 T and NK cell levels in CHC patients. In addition, activation (NKp30, NKp46) and inhibitory (NKG2A) receptors on NK cells were downregulated to yield a NK cell phenotype resembling that observed in the healthy controls. This study provides insight into the normalization of immune cell levels under DAA therapy and indicates that restoration of the immune system in CHC patients strongly supports long-term curative hepatitis C virus eradication.

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to evaluate the immune effect of intramuscular primary immunization by the nucleic acid vaccine pcDNA/glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase-interleukin-2 (pcDNA/Gpd-IL-2) and enhanced immunization 2 weeks later with the combination of mucosal adjuvant CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) and Gpd-IL-2 recombinant protein on skin infection caused by  (Tp) in New Zealand rabbits. At week 8 following immunization, MTT assay was used to detect spleen cell proliferation, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect the cytokine and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) levels. At week 10 after primary immunization, rabbits were inoculated with 10 Tp (Nichols strain). Alterations in the skin redness, swelling and ulceration were recorded for 0-60 days. In addition, positive rate of Tp in skin lesions and ulcer formation rate were examined using dark field and silver staining. The results indicated that intramuscular primary immunization by nucleic acid vaccine pcDNA/Gpd-IL-2 followed by enhanced immunization via nasal feeding with mucosal adjuvant CpG-ODN and Gpd-IL-2 recombinant protein induced the higher levels of Tp Gpd specific antibodies, increased the secretion of IL-2 and interferon-\u03b3, and promoted the proliferation of T cells in the first 8 weeks after immunization. Furthermore, this immunization strategy stimulated the production of mucosa specific SIgA antibody. Thus, this strategy led to the lowest Tp positive and ulcer formation rates at the Tp infection sites, as well as healing of skin lesions on the earliest time point (day 42). In conclusion, immunization by nucleic acid vaccine pcDNA/Gpd-IL-2 followed by enhanced immunization with a combination of mucosal adjuvant CpG-ODN and Gpd-IL-2 recombinant protein is an effective immune strategy to induce strong mucosal immune responses and immune protective effects.",

        "abstract": "Treponema pallidum is the pathogen that causes syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease; however, the pathogenic mechanism of this organism remains unclear. Tp92 is the only T.\u00a0pallidum outer membrane protein that has structural features similar to the outer membrane proteins of other Gram-negative bacteria, but the exact functions of this protein remain unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that the recombinant Tp92 protein can induce human mononuclear cell death. Tp92 mediated the human monocytic cell line derived from an acute monicytic leukemia patient (THP-1) cell death by recognizing CD14 and/or TLR2 on cell surfaces. After the stimulation of THP-1 cells by the Tp92 protein, Tp92 may induce atypical pyroptosis of THP-1 cells via the pro-caspase-1 pathway. Meanwhile, this protein caused the apoptosis of THP-1 cells via the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1/caspase-8/aspase-3 pathway. Tp92 reduced the number of monocytes among peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interestingly, further research showed that Tp92 failed to increase the tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP)-1 levels but slightly elevated the IL-8 levels via the Nuclear Factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway in THP-1 cells. The data suggest that Tp92 recognizes CD14 and TLR2, transfers the signal to a downstream pathway, and activates NF-\u03baB to mediate the production of IL-8. This mechanism may help T.\u00a0pallidum escape recognition and elimination by the host innate immune system.",

        "abstract": "Syphilis, a re-emerging public health problem worldwide caused by Treponema pallidum subsp pallidum (T.\u00a0pallidum), usually induces systemic and chronic inflammation in hosts who do not receive timely therapy after exposing to high-risk factors such as leprous sexual contact. Before the treatment, rapid and accurate detection of syphilis is essential. However, the existing detection methods, which focus on the treponemal or non-treponemal antibody test, both have inherent limitations. For instance, both of them cannot distinguish the stage and severity of syphilis. Non-treponemal test such as RPR, which is generally deemed to be used for assessing treatment response, is influenced by biological false positives. Therefore, it is imperative to seek out a new and effective diagnostic test. With recent advancements in molecular biology and whole-genome sequencing, the molecular diagnosis has increased in popularity, especially the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, we firstly present a mini-review on the research of PCR detection methods used for syphilis diagnosis over the past decade, and we then compare these methodologies to assess their potential and the challenges faced. This information can provide a fresh perspective to help researchers address the current challenges.",

Compared with traditional pure organic pH probes, these complex-based pH probes exhibited a much better selectivity due to the shielding function of the filled-in metal ion in the complex. Their pH sensing performances were affected by the ligand structure and the central metal ion. This work is the first report of \"off-on-on'-off\" colorimetric and fluorescent pH probes that possess three different reaction mechanisms and should inspire the design of multiple-responsive probes for important analytes in biological systems.

        "abstract": "Three binuclear cyclometalated PtII complexes, [(ppy)Pt(\u00b5-SA)Pt(ppy)] (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, SA: salicylaldehyde azine), have been synthesized and characterized. Owing to the blockage of the intramolecular rotation of the bridging SA ligands, all three complexes exhibit propeller-type enantiomers and aggregation-induced phosphorescence (AIP). Interestingly, one complex with \u2013NEt2 groups instead of long alkyl chains, amide, urea peptides, cholesterol, sugar, or steroidal groups was found to show strong phosphorescence enhancement gated by the gelation process. This unusual gelation behavior is rarely encountered, as the metallogel has no intermolecular hydrogen bonding or Pt\u2013Pt interactions. We attribute the driving force of this gelation-induced phosphorescence (GIP) to the propeller-type structure, optimally balanced solubility of \u2013NEt2 groups, enantiomer-induced \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions, and strong multiple intermolecular H\u2013C, H\u2013O, and H\u2013H interactions.",

Mechanochromic fluorescence enhancement and enantiomers are also found in TSB solids. Moreover, these flexible and tripod-like molecular cages acting as ideal and universal anion hosts can be used to detect anions with turn-on fluorescence signals (fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.51). Combining their advantages of AIE and biocompatibility, TSBs have potential application in living cell imaging. The inherent relationships between their chemical structures and AIE/anion host properties are studied, which provide unequivocal insights for the design of non-conjugated fluorescent materials.",

Firework fuses geographically distributed data by creating virtual shared data views that are exposed to end users via predefined interfaces by data owners. The interfaces are provided in the form of a set of data and a set of functions, in which the functions are bound to the data.

        "abstract": "A significant number of heterogeneously-catalyzed chemical processes occur under liquid conditions, but simulating catalyst function under such conditions is challenging when it is necessary to include the solvent molecules. The bond breaking and forming processes modeled in these systems necessitate the use of quantum chemical methods. Since molecules in the liquid phase are under constant thermal motion, simulations must also include configurational sampling. This means that multiple configurations of liquid molecules must be simulated for each catalytic species of interest. The goal of the protocol presented here is to generate and sample trajectories of configurations of liquid water molecules around catalytic species on flat transition metal surfaces in a way that balances chemical accuracy with computational expense. Specifically, force field molecular dynamics (FFMD) simulations are used to generate configurations of liquid molecules that can subsequently be used in quantum mechanics-based methods such as density functional theory or ab initio molecular dynamics. To illustrate this, in this manuscript, the protocol is used for catalytic intermediates that could be involved in the pathway for the decomposition of glycerol (C3H8O3). The structures that are generated using FFMD are modeled in DFT in order to estimate the enthalpies of solvation of the catalytic species and to identify how H2O molecules participate in catalytic decompositions.",

        "abstract": "Water influences catalytic reactions in multiple ways, including energetic and mechanistic effects. While simulations have provided significant insight into the roles that H2O molecules play in aqueous-phase heterogeneous catalysis, questions still remain as to the extent to which H2O structures influence catalytic mechanisms. Specifically, influences of the configurational variability in the water structures at the catalyst interface are yet to be understood. Configurational variability is challenging to capture, as it requires multiscale approaches. Herein, we apply a multiscale sampling approach to calculate reaction thermodynamics and kinetics for COH* dehydrogenation to CO* and CH3OH* dehydrogenation to CH2OH* on Pt(111) catalysts under liquid H2O. We explore various pathways for these dehydrogenation reactions that could influence the overall mechanism of methanol decomposition by including participation of H2O structures both energetically and mechanistically. We find that the liquid H2O environment significantly influences the mechanism of COH* dehydrogenation to CO* but leaves the mechanism of CH3OH* dehydrogenation to CH2OH* largely unaltered.",

The analysis includes examination of the surface topography and chemistry, grinding force, grinding force ratio, surface roughness, grinding temperature, and grinding wheel wear. Six different texturing patterns with the same parameters of groove pitch, depth, and width are designed and compared to non-textured Ti-6Al-4V. The experimental results indicate that laser texturing the surface produces clear reductions in the grinding force of up to 45\u201356% and the grinding temperature of up to 41\u201352% compared to the non-textured surface. The optimal effect among the Ti-6Al-4V samples is found when grinding a sample textured with a cross-helix pattern. The results of this study confirm the feasibility of reducing the difficulty in grinding difficult-to-machine Ti-6Al-4V materials through the application of laser texturing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Silicon nitride ceramics are extremely difficult and time-consuming to machine with conventional methods due to high strength and hardness. Laser-assisted machining has been a field of extensive research during the past decade, as it is a promising solution to enhance the machinability of many difficult-to-cut materials, including silicon nitride ceramics. To enhance the processing precision of silicon nitride ceramic grinding, in this work a laser macro-structured method using pulsed laser is proposed and applied to produce certain macro patterns on the surface of diamond grinding wheel. Grinding performance of the macro-structured grinding wheel is tested and compared with a non-structured grinding wheel. It is found that the laser structured pattern has a strong influence on the grinding characteristics. The normal and tangential grinding forces for laser macro-structured grinding (LMSG) condition are 16.3% (15.1%) lower than that in the conventional grinding (CG) condition. The grinding temperature and subsurface damage decrease significantly for LMSG condition. However, due to the influence of pattern geometry, the improvement for surface roughness is not obvious. The groove wear does not reveal a significant increase in wear of the structured grinding wheel.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and 5- to 10-fold increased seizure incidence. How seizures contribute to cognitive decline in AD or other disorders is unclear. We show that\u00a0spontaneous seizures increase expression of \u0394FosB, a highly stable Fos-family transcription factor, in the hippocampus of an AD mouse model. \u0394FosB suppressed expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos, which is critical for plasticity and cognition, by binding its promoter and triggering histone deacetylation. Acute histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition or inhibition of \u0394FosB activity restored c-Fos induction and improved cognition in AD mice. Administration of seizure-inducing agents to nontransgenic mice also resulted in \u0394FosB-mediated suppression of c-Fos, suggesting that this mechanism is not confined to AD mice. These results explain observations that c-Fos expression increases after acute neuronal activity but decreases with chronic activity. Moreover, these results indicate a general mechanism by which seizures contribute to persistent cognitive deficits, even during seizure-free periods.",

        "abstract": "The activity-induced transcription factor \u2206FosB has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a critical regulator of hippocampal function and cognition downstream of seizures and network hyperexcitability. With its long half-life (> 1 week), \u2206FosB is well-poised to modulate hippocampal gene expression over extended periods of time, enabling effects to persist even during seizure-free periods. However, the transcriptional mechanisms by which \u2206FosB regulates hippocampal function are poorly understood due to lack of identified hippocampal gene targets. To identify putative \u2206FosB gene targets, we employed high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA bound to \u2206FosB after chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-sequencing). We compared ChIP-sequencing results from hippocampi of transgenic mice expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and nontransgenic (NTG) wild-type littermates. Surprisingly, only 52 \u2206FosB gene targets were shared between NTG and APP mice; the vast majority of targets were unique to one genotype or the other. We also found a functional shift in the repertoire of \u2206FosB gene targets between NTG and APP mice. A large number of targets in NTG mice are involved in neurodevelopment and/or cell morphogenesis, whereas in APP mice there is an enrichment of targets involved in regulation of membrane potential and neuronal excitability. RNA-sequencing and quantitative PCR experiments confirmed that expression of putative \u2206FosB gene targets were altered in the hippocampus of APP mice. This study provides key insights into functional domains regulated by \u2206FosB in the hippocampus, emphasizing remarkably different programs of gene regulation under physiological and pathological conditions.",

These disparate findings may relate to differences in disease stage, or the presence of seizures, which are associated with AD and can stimulate neurogenesis. In this study, we investigate a transgenic mouse model of AD that exhibits seizures similarly to AD patients and find that neurogenesis is increased in early stages of disease, as spontaneous seizures became evident, but is decreased below control levels as seizures recur. Treatment with the antiseizure drug levetiracetam restores neurogenesis and improves performance in a neurogenesis-associated spatial discrimination task. Our results suggest that seizures stimulate, and later accelerate the depletion of, the hippocampal neural stem cell pool. These results have implications for AD as well as any disorder accompanied by recurrent seizures, such as epilepsy.",

Here, we developed a sample preparation methodology for enzymatic lysis and sample heating for low-resource, point-of-care applications. We show an instrument-free chemical heater system for rapid lysis of a Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus) and an RNA virus (human respiratory syncytial virus) using a dried lysis enzyme mixture (achromopeptidase) for S. aureus. After a lysis step (u003c1 minute), lysis enzymes are heat deactivated (u003c5 minutes) using a simple disposable chemical heater. We demonstrated that both DNA and RNA in the heat-treated sample could be directly amplified without purification, even in the presence of a clinically-obtained human nasal sample. This simple approach to dry enzyme storage and sample heating is adaptable to many applications where samples need to be lysed, including use in low-resource laboratories and in single-use or cartridge-based point-of-care diagnostic devices.",

Here we provide a head-to-head comparison of methods for lysis of, and nucleic acid release from, several pathogenic bacteria and viruses\u2014methods that are adaptable to point-of-care usage in low-resource settings. Digestion with achromopeptidase, a mixture of proteases and peptidoglycan-specific hydrolases, followed by thermal deactivation in a boiling water bath, effectively released amplifiable nucleic acid from  Staphylococcus aureus, Bordetella pertussis,  respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. Achromopeptidase was functional after dehydration and reconstitution, even after eleven months of dry storage without refrigeration. Mechanical lysis methods proved to be effective against a hard-to-lyse  Mycobacterium  species, and a miniature bead-mill, the AudioLyse, is shown to be capable of releasing amplifiable DNA and RNA from this species. We conclude that point-of-care-compatible sample preparation methods for nucleic acid tests need not introduce amplification inhibitors, and can provide amplification-ready lysates from a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens.",

The multiplexable autonomous disposable nucleic acid amplification test (MAD NAAT) is based on two-dimensional paper networks, which enable sensitive chemical detection normally reserved for laboratories to be carried out anywhere by untrained users. All reagents are stored dry in the disposable test device and are rehydrated by stored buffer. The paper network is physically multiplexed to allow independent isothermal amplification of multiple targets; each amplification reaction is also chemically multiplexed with an internal amplification control. The total test time is less than one hour. The MAD NAAT prototype was used to characterize a set of human nasal swab specimens pre-screened for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria. With qPCR as the quantitative reference method, the lowest input copy number in the range where the MAD NAAT prototype consistently detected MRSA in these specimens was \u223c5 \u00d7 103 genomic copies (\u223c600 genomic copies per biplexed amplification reaction).",

In this work, the softening of heat-treated Al\u2013Zn\u2013Mg alloy was studied in the multipass welding process. By Gleeble-3500 thermal\u2013mechanical simulator, the heat treatment and tensile test with welding thermal cycles were carried out to simulate the microstructure evolution and mechanical softening during multipass welding. After that, the softening mechanism of the HAZ was analyzed by microstructure analysis. The results indicate that the heat-treated Al\u2013Zn\u2013Mg alloy exhibited obvious softening after several thermal cycles with peak temperature higher than 200\u2218C, and this phenomenon is worse with increasing peak temperature. Based on the microstructure analysis, it was found that the reinforcement phase changes according to the applied thermal cycles, which strongly affects the strength of Al\u2013Zn\u2013Mg alloys.",

Ph(+) leukemia cells frequently express death-inducing receptors (DR4 and DR5) for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is one of the cytotoxic ligands expressed on cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells mediating the GVL effect. Here we demonstrate that imatinib specifically downregulated DR4 and DR5 expression in cell lines and clinical samples of Ph(+) leukemia. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib and nilotinib) and short hairpin RNA against bcr-abl also downregulated DR4 and DR5 expression in Ph(+) leukemia cells, and transfection of bcr-abl into a Ph(-) leukemia cell line induced DR4 and DR5 expression, which was abrogated by imatinib treatment. Accordingly, Ph(+) leukemia cells that had been pretreated with imatinib showed resistance to the pro-apoptotic activity of recombinant human soluble TRAIL. These observations demonstrate that BCR-ABL is critically involved in the leukemia-specific expression of DR4 and DR5 and in the susceptibility of Ph(+) leukemia to TRAIL-mediated anti-leukemic activity, providing new insight into the mechanisms of the tumor-specific cytotoxic activities of TRAIL.",
