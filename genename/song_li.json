        "title": "Cell-Shape Regulation of Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation",
        "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play an important role in vascular remodeling. Heterogeneity and phenotypic changes in SMCs are usually accompanied by a morphological difference, i.e., elongated/spindle-like versus spread-out or epithelioid/rhomboid cell shapes. However, it is not known whether the cell shape directly regulates SMC proliferation, and what the underlying mechanisms are. In this study, microgrooves and micropatterned matrix islands were used to engineer the cell shape and investigate the associated biophysical and biological mechanisms. Compared to spread-out SMCs on nonpatterned surfaces, SMCs on micropatterned surfaces demonstrated elongated morphology, significantly lower cell and nucleus shape indexes, less spreading, a lower proliferation rate, and a similar response (but to a lesser extent) to platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor- \u03b2 , and mechanical stretching. DNA microarray profiling revealed a lower expression of neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1) in elongated SMCs. Knocking down NOR-1 suppressed DNA synthesis in SMCs, suggesting that NOR-1 is a mediator of cell elongation effects. Regulation of DNA synthesis in SMCs by the cell shape alone and a decrease in DNA synthesis in the case of small cell spreading area were achieved by micropatterning SMCs on matrix islands of different shapes and spreading areas. Changes in the cell shape also affected the nucleus shape, whereas variations in the cell spreading area modulated the nucleus volume, indicating a possible link between nucleus morphology (both shape and volume) and DNA synthesis. The findings of this investigation provide insight into cell shape effects on cell structure and proliferation, and have direct implications for vascular pathophysiology.",

        "abstract": "Manned mission to space has been threatened by various cosmos risks including radiation, mirogravity, vacuum, confinement, etc., which may cause genetic variations of astronauts and eventually lead to damages of their health. Thus, the development of small biomedical devices, which can monitor astronaut gene expression changes, is useful for future long-term space missions. Using magnetic microbeads packed with nanocrystal quantum dots at controlled ratios, we were able to generate highly multiplexed nanobarcodes, which can encode a flexible panel of genes. Also, by using a reporter quantum dot, this nanobarcode platform can monitor and quantify gene expression level with improved speed and sensitivity. As a comparison, we studied TGF-\u03b21 induced transcription changes in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with both the nanobarcode microbead system and the Affymetrix GeneChip \u00ae HTA system, which is currently considered as the industrial standard. Though using only 1/20 of the sample RNA, the nanobarcode system showed sensitivity equivalent to Affymetrix GeneChip \u00ae system. The coefficient of variation, dynamic range, and accuracy of the nanobarcodes measurement is equivalent to that of the GeneChip \u00ae HTA system. Therefore, this newly invented nanobarcode microbead platform is thought to be sensitive, flexible, cost-effective and accurate in a level equivalent to the conventional methods. As an extension of the use of this new platform, spacecrafts may carry this miniaturized system as a diagnostic tool for the astronauts.",

Human iPSC-NCSCs were suspended in fibrin gel and transplanted into a rat patellar tendon window defect. At 4 weeks post-transplantation, macroscopical observation showed that the repair of iPSC-NCSC-treated tendons was superior to that of non-iPSC-NCSC-treated tendons. Histological and mechanical examinations revealed that iPSC-NCSCs treatment significantly enhanced tendon healing as indicated by the improvement in matrix synthesis and mechanical properties. Furthermore, transplanted iPSC-NCSCs produced fetal tendon-related matrix proteins, stem cell recruitment factors, and tenogenic differentiation factors, and accelerated the host endogenous repair process.

        "title": "Biophysical regulation of epigenetic state and cell reprogramming",
        "abstract": "Biochemical factors can help reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, yet the role of biophysical factors during reprogramming is unknown. Here, we show that biophysical cues, in the form of parallel microgrooves on the surface of cell-adhesive substrates, can replace the effects of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers and significantly improve reprogramming efficiency. The mechanism relies on the mechanomodulation of the cells\u2019 epigenetic state. Specifically, decreased histone deacetylase activity and upregulation of the expression of WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5)\u2014a subunit of H3 methyltranferase\u2014by microgrooved surfaces lead to increased histone H3 acetylation and methylation. We also show that microtopography promotes a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in adult fibroblasts. Nanofibrous scaffolds with aligned fibre orientation produce effects similar to those produced by microgrooves, suggesting that changes in cell morphology may be responsible for modulation of the epigenetic state. These findings have important implications in cell biology and in the optimization of biomaterials for cell-engineering applications. Cell reprogramming represents a major advancement in cell biology and has wide applications in regenerative medicine, disease modelling and drug screening. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be produced from somatic cells by the forced expression of four or fewer transcription factors (for example, Oct4 (O), Sox2 (S), Klf4 (K) and c-Myc (M), or Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28; refs  1, 2, 3, 4). Recently, the overexpression of epithelial-cadherin (E-cad) was shown to replace the need for Oct4\u2014the most critical factor of the OSKM cocktail\u2014during cell reprogramming5. In addition, the elimination of E-cad in somatic cells prevents nuclear reprogramming to pluripotency all together6. These results corroborate the importance of the reported mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) that occurs during the reprogramming process7. Since the first report on iPSC generation, researchers have employed numerous methods to improve reprogramming efficiency. Chemical compounds, in particular, have shown great promise in enhancing the efficiency of iPSC formation and/or eliminating the need for some oncogenic transcription factors such as c-Myc and Klf4 (refs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). For example, valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was reported to increase the percentage of Oct4+ cells generated during reprogramming11. Tranylcypromine hydrochloride (TCP), an inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase, was also shown to significantly improve reprogramming efficiency9. Researchers have more recently demonstrated the ability of VPA to promote transcription-factor-free reprogramming through the overexpression of microRNAs (miRNAs), specifically the miR302/367 cluster, in mouse fibroblasts13. Interestingly, this miRNA-mediated reprogramming was shown to be dependent on VPA-induced degradation of HDAC2, suggesting that HDAC proteins act as inhibitors of cell reprogramming. These studies, along with many others14, 15, 16, highlight the critical role of histone modifications and other epigenetic factors in cell reprogramming. Although extensive studies have been performed on the roles of transcription factors, miRNAs and chemical compounds in cell reprogramming, the role of biophysical cues in this process has yet to be revealed. Biophysical factors (that is, the topographical and mechanical properties of cell-adhesive materials) have been shown to regulate a variety of cellular functions such as migration, proliferation and differentiation17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Importantly, these functions have closely related influences in a broad range of complex biological processes such as wound healing, tissue remodelling and tumour growth. There is also growing evidence that biophysical signals can be transmitted through the cytoskeleton, and into the nucleus and chromatin30, 31. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that substrate properties can help regulate adult stem cell self-renewal32, 33, and an increasing number of laboratories have investigated the role of mechanotransduction in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells6, 20, 34, 35, 36 (ESCs). These studies highlight the importance of biomechanics in the regulation of pluripotency. For example, an intact actin\u2013myosin network is critical for the stable propagation of human ESCs. Non-muscle myosin IIA, specifically, was found to play a critical role in ESC maintenance because its inhibition, by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown or treatment with blebbistatin, downregulates the expression of E-cad, a transmembrane mechanosensor, leading to a deregulation of the pluripotency circuitry6, 34. Still, it is not known whether or how the biophysical properties of cell-adhesive materials influence adult cell reprogramming, a reverse process of cell differentiation. In addition, whether mechanotransduction can induce critical epigenetic modifications in somatic cells, which might facilitate the reprogramming process, also remains unclear. To elucidate the role of biophysical factors in cell reprogramming, we have used reprogramming technology in conjunction with various bioengineered substrates. Our data show that the biophysical microenvironment, in the form of micro- and nano-scale topography on cell-adhesive substrates, can induce pronounced changes in histone acetylation and methylation patterns, which are dependent on cell morphological changes and actin\u2013myosin tension. These epigenetic changes can replace the effects of potent small-molecule epigenetic modifiers and significantly improve iPSC generation efficiency. Furthermore, we identify specific mediators of this epigenetic mechanomodulation. Our findings represent a significant advancement in the understanding of mechanotransduction by revealing a new relationship between the biophysical microenvironment, epigenetic mechanomodulation and cell reprogramming. To assess whether topography might influence the process of cell reprogramming, primary fibroblasts, isolated from adult mouse ears, were first transduced using polycistronic lentiviral vectors, STEMCCA\u2013loxP or STEMCCA\u2013loxP\u2013RedLight37, encoding reprogramming factors OSKM or OSK, respectively. Following transduction, cells were seeded onto flat poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) membranes or those fabricated with parallel microgrooves of various width and spacing (40, 20 and 10\u2009\u03bcm). The three-dimensional structure of PDMS membranes with a 10\u2009\u03bcm groove width is shown in Fig. 1a. Groove heights were maintained at 3\u2009\u03bcm for all cases. As expected, microgroove substrates had a pronounced effect on fibroblast alignment and nuclear elongation (Fig. 1b). In general, cells aligned with microgrooves, and cell spreading decreased on microgrooves. In addition, nuclear shape index decreased (more elongated) as microgroove width and spacing decreased (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Cell proliferation, as quantified by EdU (5-ethynyl-2\u2019-deoxyuridine) incorporation, also decreased slightly (Supplementary Fig. 1b). After seeding, transduced cells were cultured in mouse ESC (mESC) culture conditions (see Fig. 1c for the reprogramming procedure). After 12\u201314 days, iPSC colonies were subcultured and expanded or immunostained for Nanog protein expression and quantified. Colony formation was observed on all PDMS membranes. Interestingly, colonies formed on microgrooves exhibited a more elongated morphology relative to those formed on flat surfaces, and favoured outgrowth along the axis of groove alignment (Fig. 1d). In addition, we observed that microgroove topography significantly enhanced cell reprogramming efficiency in mouse fibroblasts transduced with OSKM, where microgrooves of 10\u2009\u03bcm width (and spacing) exhibited the most pronounced effect. Here, the number of Nanog+ colonies observed was more than fourfold higher than that seen on flat PDMS membranes (Fig. 1e). A similar trend was observed in mouse fibroblasts infected with only 3 factors (OSK; Fig. 1f). This enhancement of reprogramming efficiency by microgrooves was also confirmed by using mouse fibroblasts isolated from Oct4\u2013GFP reporter mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). Given that 10\u2009\u03bcm-width grooves showed the greatest enhancement in cell reprogramming, we used these membranes to investigate the mechanism of action during further experimentation. To further characterize iPSCs, colonies generated on 10\u2009\u03bcm-width grooved substrates were isolated and expanded for at least six passages. Colonies were then immunostained to confirm their expression of mESC-specific markers Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and SSEA-1 (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 3). Before immunostaining, we observed that iPSCs generated using STEMCCA\u2013loxP\u2013RedLight did not exhibit mCherry fluorescence, suggesting that transgene expression was silenced after six passages (data not shown). In addition, we confirmed that the generated iPSCs were capable of forming teratomas in vivo (Fig. 1h) and embryoid bodies in vitro, with differentiation potential for all three germ layers (Supplementary Fig. 4). Consistently, we also observed a similar trend in reprogramming efficiency of normal neonatal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) cultured on flat and microgrooved surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 5). Modulation of chromatin-modifying enzymes has a direct effect on cell reprogramming16. In addition, somatic cells must undergo pronounced changes in chromatin structure to overcome the epigenetic barriers of cell reprogramming14, 15. A number of these barriers as they relate to histone modifications have been well characterized. On the basis of our previous observations in mesenchymal stem cells38, we postulated that microgroove topography might increase the presence of histone H3 acetylation (AcH3) marks in adult fibroblasts, which tend to promote cell reprogramming. For this reason, we performed a western blotting analysis to monitor global changes in AcH3 and other histone marks shown to influence cell reprogramming. Through our analysis, we found that microgrooves markedly increased global AcH3 marks in non-transduced mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 2a) in the absence of reprogramming factors. Interestingly, we also observed an increase in methylation (both di- and tri-methylation) of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, respectively) on microgrooved substrates relative to flat surfaces (Fig. 2a). A similar trend in histone modifications was observed in fibroblasts infected with OSKM (Supplementary Fig. 6). Confocal microscopy confirmed that this increase was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2b). As AcH3, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks are associated with transcript activation and/or critical in the early phase of reprogramming39, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)\u2013quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay at the promoter regions of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog\u2014the key regulators of the pluripotency network. ChIP analysis revealed significant increases in AcH3 at all three promoter regions on microgrooves relative to flat surfaces. The promoter region of Nanog showed a significant increase in H3K4me2 marks, whereas the promoter region of Sox2 showed a significant increase in H3K4me3 marks (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that microgroove topography can induce global and local changes in histone H3 acetylation and methylation that are highly favourable in the activation of reprogramming genes. To further test the hypothesis that the observed increases in histone H3 acetylation and methylation on microgrooves play a role in topography-enhanced cell reprogramming, we compared the microgroove effect with that of potent small-molecule epigenetic modifiers. In particular, VPA and TCP\u2014HDAC and histone demethylase enzyme inhibitors, respectively\u2014have been shown to greatly improve cell reprogramming efficiency9, 11. Both VPA and TCP induced global increases in AcH3, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in our system (Fig. 2a), suggesting that VPA and TCP had some overlapping effects on histone modifications. To determine whether microgrooves and VPA or TCP have similar effects on cell reprogramming, we reprogrammed fibroblasts cultured on flat and microgrooved membranes in the absence or presence of chemical compounds\u2014VPA and TCP, alone or combined. From this experiment, we make several noteworthy observations. As expected, VPA and TCP alone produced a significant increase in the number of Nanog+ colonies observed when the cells were reprogrammed on flat membranes (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, the number of colonies generated on flat membranes in the presence of chemical compounds increased to levels comparable with that of microgrooves in the absence of VPA and TCP, indicating that microgroove substrates had a similar effect to the chemical compounds in enhancing reprogramming efficiency. In addition, VPA and TCP showed no effect on the number of Nanog+ colonies formed on microgrooves, suggesting that their mechanism of action might share a similar pathway in improving reprogramming efficiency. As VPA was shown to be necessary for the generation of miRNA-iPSCs in mouse fibroblasts13, although complete reprogramming may not be consistently achieved40, we examined the ability of microgrooved membranes to generate colonies under the forced expression of the miRNA cluster 302/367 in the absence of VPA. Remarkably, we were able to generate colonies only on microgrooves but not on flat membranes (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We were also unable to generate any colonies with VPA alone. Although our microgrooved surfaces showed the ability to form Nanog+ and GFP+ clones (using fibroblasts isolated from wild-type and Oct4\u2013GFP reporter mice, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c), we were unable to expand these iPSC-like colonies, suggesting that microgrooved surfaces could enhance the early stage of cell reprogramming, and that additional chemical or reprogramming factors may be necessary to achieve complete reprogramming into iPSCs. These results demonstrated the ability of microgroove topography to replace or mimic the effects of chemical compounds, VPA and TCP, in cell reprogramming. To elucidate the upstream mechanotransduction pathways involved in the regulation of the histone H3 modifications observed, we first monitored nuclear HDAC activity in fibroblasts cultured on microgrooved or flat membranes. Indeed, nuclear HDAC activity was significantly reduced on microgrooved substrates relative to the flat surfaces (Fig. 3a), which may account for the topography-induced AcH3. Western blotting analysis was performed to examine the expression of several HDAC proteins in mouse fibroblasts. Our results indicate that microgrooves induce pronounced decreases in the expression of HDAC2 but not HDAC1 and HDAC3 (Fig. 3b). By using confocal microscopy, we observed a presence of HDAC2 specifically within the nucleus of mouse fibroblasts, which is markedly decreased on microgrooves (Fig. 3c). As miRNA-mediated reprogramming was shown to be specifically dependent on VPA-induced degradation of the HDAC2 protein, microgrooved topography, as with VPA, might promote the increase in global AcH3 through the downregulation of HDAC2, which may lead to the observed enhancement in cell reprogramming by OSKM and in the partial reprogramming by miRNA302/367 transduction (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 7a). To investigate potential upstream mediators of the observed increase in H3K4 methylation on microgrooves, we screened for regulators of histone methylation. Given the recent evidence that WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5)\u2014a subunit of H3 methyltranferase\u2014mediates both cell reprogramming and ESC self-renewal41, we probed for its expression through western blotting analysis and immunostaining. Interestingly, we observed that microgrooves markedly upregulated the expression of WDR5 in mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 3d,e). This result led us to perform RNA interference on WDR5 in the presence of microgrooves to determine its effects on histone modifications. Sufficient knockdown of WDR5 was confirmed at protein and gene expression levels (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 8). Surprisingly, WDR5 knockdown on grooves resulted in substantially lower levels of both H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 as well as AcH3 in mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 3f), suggesting that WDR5 plays a critical role in the modulation of both histone methylation and acetylation marks. This result also presents a new role for WDR5 as a key mediator of mechanotransduction. MET is required for nuclear reprogramming in mouse fibroblasts7. In addition, a number of studies have implicated the roles of both HDAC2 and WDR5 in the expression of several epithelial and mesenchymal-associated genes42, 43. For these reasons, we monitored the effect of microgroove topography on the expression of several genes associated with a MET. Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of non-transduced fibroblasts cultured on microgrooves for 3 days showed increased messenger RNA (relative to those cultured on flat membranes) for several epithelial-related genes (for example, E-cad, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM), keratin 8 (Krt8), occludin (Ocln) and claudin 3 (Cldn3)) and reduced mRNA for multiple mesenchymal markers (for example, transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor 1 (Tgfbr1), snail homologue 1 (Snai1), snail homologue 2 (Snai2), vimentin (Vim) and integrin \u03b2 1 (Itgb1)). This result suggests that microgroove topography promotes the initiation of a MET in adult mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 4a). In an effort to link the histone modifications observed on microgrooved surfaces to the observed increases in epithelial-related gene expression, we performed ChIP\u2013qPCR analysis on histone H3 modifications at the promoter of E-cad. Indeed, we observed increases in the presence of H3K4me2 at the E-cad promoter (Fig. 4b). Other marks showed no detectable change (Supplementary Fig. 9), suggesting that H3K4me2 mediates the enhanced E-cad expression and MET transition on microgrooves. Activation of transforming growth factor- \u03b2 (TGF- \u03b2) pathways has been shown to block MET in cell reprogramming7. To study whether the observed MET plays a role in the topographical enhancement of cell reprogramming, we tested the effect of microgrooves on cell reprogramming in the presence of TGF- \u03b21. As shown in Fig. 4c, TGF- \u03b21 completely blocked the enhanced reprogramming by microgroove topography. Furthermore, inhibition of the TGF- \u03b2 pathway using Alk5i increased reprogramming efficiency on flat surfaces as expected, but showed no synergistic behaviour in reprogramming efficiency on microgrooves (Fig. 4d). Taken together, these results suggest that the MET induced by microgrooves plays an important role in topography-enhanced cell reprogramming. Microgroove topography facilitates pronounced cytoskeleton reorganization in fibroblasts. Still, it is not clear how or whether these cytoskeletal changes are important in the mechanomodulation of histone modifications and their upstream regulators. For this reason, we disrupted actin\u2013myosin contractility in fibroblasts by treatment with blebbistatin, a non-muscle myosin-II inhibitor. Remarkably, blebbistatin treatment eliminates the effect of microgrooves on the epigenetic modulation of AcH3, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 as well as the mediators HDAC2 and WDR5 (Fig. 4e). These data strongly suggest that the cytoskeleton reorganization observed in fibroblasts on microgrooves and the actin\u2013myosin contractility are critical in this mechanomodulation of epigenetic state and thus cell reprogramming. Figure 4f summarizes the effects of microgrooves on histone modifications and cell reprogramming in adult mouse fibroblasts. Nanofibrous scaffolds can regulate cell morphology, cell organization and cell migration, as can microgrooves23, 25. To generalize the role of topography in epigenetic mechanomodulation, we employed the use of nanofibrous membranes in our studies. Figure 5a shows nanofibre structure in aligned and random orientations and its effect on fibroblast morphology. As with microgrooves, aligned nanofibres encouraged fibroblast alignment and elongation over the random nanofibres. Western blotting analysis revealed that fibroblasts cultured on aligned nanofibres also exhibit global increases in AcH3, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks over fibroblasts cultured on random fibres (Fig. 5b). In addition, these changes correlated well with the decrease in HDAC2 and the increase in WDR5 protein expression. Next, we seeded fibroblasts transduced with OSKM onto nanofibre surfaces to determine the effects of random and aligned fibre orientation on reprogramming efficiency. Indeed, aligned nanofibres generated significantly more Nanog+ colonies than random fibres (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Fig. 10). These results confirm that nanofibre alignment produces an effect similar to microgrooves in epigenetic modification and cell reprogramming. A common effect of microgrooves and aligned nanofibres is cell elongation. To directly determine whether this cell-morphology change is sufficient to induce histone modifications or whether topography is required, we used micropatterning techniques to gain tight control over cell shape while culturing cells on topographically flat surfaces. Fibroblasts were cultured on micropatterned islands with well-defined cell shapes (round or elongated). Interestingly, fluorescence microscopy revealed that cells in an elongated shape (cell shape index or CSI\u2009=\u20090.1) exhibited significantly higher levels of nuclear AcH3, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 as compared with cells in a circular shape (CSI\u2009=\u20091; Fig. 5e,f) with an equal spreading area. These data suggest that the morphological change experienced by fibroblasts, when interacting with the nano- and micro-scale features of cell-adhesive materials is sufficient to induce epigenetic modifications. Cell elongation also significantly correlated with an elongation of the cell nucleus (Supplementary Fig. 11). Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that biophysical cues, in the form of parallel microgrooves or aligned nanofibres on the surface of cell-adhesive substrates, can significantly improve reprogramming efficiency and replace the effects of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers. The mechanism behind this biophysical enhancement of cell reprogramming relies on mechanomodulation of H3 acetylation and methylation marks, which are regulated by HDAC2 and WDR5. These epigenetic changes may also play a role in the increased expression of epithelial-related genes on microgrooved membranes. We believe this new biophysical regulation of epigenetics has important implications in the broad scope of cell biology, and provides a rational basis for the optimization of biomaterials and the cellular microenvironment for a number of biological applications. In any given physiological microenvironment, cells may experience a number of different biophysical inputs, which, as we show, might induce critical changes in epigenetic signature. Given the broad influence of epigenetics in cell behaviour and phenotype determination, our results have interesting implications beyond this field. It will be useful to explore, for example, whether these microtopography-induced changes in histone marks poise adult fibroblasts into a more plastic or unstable epigenetic state, allowing them to more readily transition into other phenotypes. Such evidence could greatly advance the field of cell biology by helping understand how mechanomodulated epigenetic changes alter cell behaviour in cell\u2013material interactions, and direct cell reprogramming into cardiomyocytes and neurons44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, tumour growth and metastasis, and adult stem/progenitor cell differentiation. This information is critical to the medical field as it presents new ways to maximize the potential of stem cell technologies, mitigate pathophysiological response in injured and diseased states, and greatly improve the design of next-generation biomaterials. Ear tissues from adult C57BL/6 mice were minced and then partially digested in a solution of 3\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121 collagenase type IV (Invitrogen) and 0.25% trypsin\u2013EDTA (GIBCO) for 30\u2009min under constant agitation at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Partially digested tissues were plated and fibroblasts were allowed to migrate out (passage 0). Isolated fibroblasts were expanded in MEF medium (DMEM (Hyclone) +10%FBS (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO)) and used exclusively at passage 2 for all experiments. Fibroblasts from Oct4\u2013GFP reporter mice (008214; The Jackson Laboratory) were also isolated as described above. NHDFs were purchased from Lonza (CC-2509) and expanded in FGM-2 BulletKit (CC-3132) for 1\u20132 passages. After transduction, mouse fibroblasts were seeded onto PDMS membranes with flat and microgroove topographies or nanofibres of aligned and random orientation. After seeding, transduced fibroblasts were maintained in MEF medium for 48\u2009h. For the next 10\u201312 days, cells were fed with mouse mESC medium (DMEM +15% mouse ESC maintenance FBS (STEMCELL Technologies), 100\u2009units\u2009ml\u22121 ESGRO mouse leukaemia inhibitory factor (mLIF; Millipore), 0.1\u2009mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and 1\u00d7 MEM non-essential amino acid (GIBCO)). Reprogrammed NHDFs were cultured in mTeSR 1 complete medium from STEMCELL Technologies. Human iPSCs were reprogrammed for 1 month after the infection with OSKM before colonies were expanded and/or analysed. Culture medium was replenished every 1\u20132 days during reprogramming. VPA (0.5\u2009mM; Sigma) and TCP (5\u2009\u03bcM; Sigma) were used for biochemical modulation of epigenetics. Cells were exposed to TGF- \u03b21 (2\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121) for 5 days for activation of the TGF- \u03b2 pathway. A-83-01 (0.5\u2009\u03bcM; Millipore) was used for all 14 days during the reprogramming. Blebbistatin (10\u2009\u03bcM; or dimethylsulphoxide) was administered for 3 days. Lentiviral vectors were used to transduce mouse fibroblasts for ectopic expression of three (OSK) or four (OSKM) of the key reprogramming genes or miRNAs (miR302/367cluster). STEMCCA\u2013loxP and STEMCCA\u2013loxP\u2013RedLight plasmids were a generous gift from G. Mostoslavsky at Boston University. Lentivirus was produced using common, well-established calcium phosphate transfection methods. Viral particles were collected and concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Stable virus was aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. For viral transduction, fibroblasts were seeded and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then incubated with virus for 24\u2009h. After incubation, transduced cells were reseeded onto either PDMS or nanofibre surfaces. ChIP\u2013qPCR was performed by using a high-throughput ChIP kit (EZ-Magna ChIP HT96; Millipore), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sonicated chromatin prepared from 100,000 mouse fibroblasts was subjected to ChIP by using 3\u2009\u03bcg of normal rabbit IgG (CS200581; Millipore) or specific antibodies for AcH3 (06-599; Millipore), H3K4me2 (05-1338; Millipore) or H3K4me3 (07-473, Millipore). Substantial fold enrichment was observed for each experimental condition (Supplementary Fig. 12). ChIP\u2013qPCR data were analysed by normalizing the DNA concentration to the percentage input using a relative standard curve method. Primers for ChIP\u2013qPCR are included as (Supplementary Table 1). qRT\u2013PCR was performed using a customized StellARay Gene Expression System (Lonza) to probe for multiple genes at once. RNA was isolated using a NucleoSpin RNA II kit from Clontech and converted to complementary DNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen). qRT\u2013PCR data were analysed using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. RNA interference was performed using control (Cat. No. 4390853) and WDR5 (Cat. No. 4390771, ID: s100547, Lot: ASO0R7LI) Silencer Select short interfering RNAs (siRNA) from Ambion. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Fibroblasts were lysed and collected in a buffer containing 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS and 10\u2009mM NaF along with protease inhibitors (phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride, Na3VO4 and leupeptin). Protein lysates were centrifuged to pellet cell debris, and the supernatant was removed and quantified by DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (15\u2009mg per well) were run using SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 3% non-fat milk and incubated with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies include AcH3, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, HDAC 1, 2, 3, WDR5, H3, actin and GAPDH. Refer to Supplementary Table 2 for all antibody information. All antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution and incubated overnight. Next, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for one hour. Protein bands were visualized using Western Lightning Plus-Enhanced Chemiluminescence Substrate (Perkin Elmer Life & Analytical Sciences). Nuclear HDAC activity was performed as previously described38. Bioengineered substrates were fabricated as previously described23, 38, 50, 51. Briefly, PDMS membranes were fabricated using well-established soft lithography procedures. Poly-L-lactic acid or poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) nanofibres were fabricated using electrospinning technology where random fibres were ejected onto a grounded collector. Aligned fibres were produced by collector modifications or mechanical stretch. Micropatterned islands on PDMS substrates were fabricated using oxygen plasma treatment through the windows of a PDMS membrane mask that produced hydrophilic areas of different shapes and sizes. All substrates were coated with 2% gelatin for 1\u2009h to promote cell attachment. For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma). For actin-cytoskeleton staining, samples were incubated with fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 2\u2009h. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by 1\u2009h incubation with Alexa 488- and/or Alexa 546-labelled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with 4\u2019,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). For counting iPSC colonies, entire wells were imaged using an ImageXpress Micro System (Molecular Devices). Colonies were determined positive for Nanog protein expression on the basis of positive (mESCs) and negative (uninfected/non-reprogrammed mouse fibroblasts) thresholds. Confocal and epifluorescence images were collected using a Zeiss LSM710 microscope and Zeiss Axio Observer.A1, respectively. DAPI images were used to determine nuclear shape index. For quantification of AcH3, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 fluorescence intensity, \u00d740 epifluorescence images were used. DAPI staining was used as a mask and fluorescence intensity was averaged over the entire nucleus. All image analyses were performed using a Matlab script or ImageJ software. Teratoma formation was performed by injecting 1\u00d7106 cells into the abdominal cavity of SCID/NOD mice. After 1 month mice were euthanized, and the formed teratomas were explanted and fixed using paraffin-embedding and sectioned using a microtome. Haematoxylin and eosin staining was performed for histological analysis. Embryoid body formation for in vitro differentiation was performed using the hanging-drop method. Mouse iPSCs were cultured in mESC maintenance media without LIF. Embryoid bodies were plated onto gelatin-coated surfaces and allowed to spontaneously differentiate. After 2 weeks of differentiation, samples were fixed and immunostained. Human iPSCs were overgrown in a feeder-free system using mTeSR 1 complete medium to initiate spontaneous differentiation. All data are presented as mean, plus one standard deviation, where n\u22653. Comparisons among values for groups greater than two were performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between groups were then determined using Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. For two-group analysis, a two-tailed, unpaired t-test was used. For all cases, p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. GraphPad Prism 6.0 software was used for all statistical evaluations.

        "title": "Neural Crest-Derived Cells Migrate from Nerve to Participate in Achilles tendon Remodeling.",
        "abstract": "During tendon injuries, nerve ingrowth is one of the earliest events of tendon repair and remodeling. Since peripheral neurons and associated cells are mostly derived from neural crest (NC) cells, we sought to investigate the role of NC-derived cells in tendon regeneration. Thus, we used Sox10-Cre/ROSA26-Flox-Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) transgenic mice to trace these cells during tendon regeneration. After 4 weeks of Achilles tendon rupture, the injured tendon tissues were harvested for immunohistological analyses, cell isolation, and phenotype identification. In addition, the tenocytes were co-cultured with RFP labeled cells to examine cellular functions. Following the injury, a significant number of RFP-labeled cells penetrated into the wound site and reached a peak (\u223c30% of cells) after 2 weeks, and then stabilized at a level of \u223c20%. Interestingly, 36.9% RFP labeled cells in the injured area expressed Tuj1, suggesting that most of the cells are peripheral neurons. Some RFP /Tuj1 cells were also found adjacent to newly formed blood vessels in the tendon. Importantly, the existing Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Neuropeptide Y receptor (NPYr) in the ingrowth nerve and blood vessels showed the direct correlation with each other. In addition, there were also RFP cells (\u223c30%) negative for neuron markers but positive for fibroblast markers i.e., FAP (34.7%) and Vimentin (Vmt) (27.2%), and \u223c10% positive for Sox10. Indeed, many RFP cells isolated from the ruptured Achilles tendon showed long spindle shapes and expressed fibroblast phenotypic markers FSP1 and FAP. Particularly, part of the Sox10 RFP-labeled cells exhibited osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation ability. It is concluded that after Achilles tendon injury, nerves sprout into the wound site. The NC-derived Vmt+/FAP+ mesenchymal cells and peripheral nerves participate in tendon regeneration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and have tremendous potential as a cell source for cardiovascular regeneration. We postulate that specific vascular environmental factors will promote MSC differentiation into SMCs. However, the effects of the vascular mechanical environment on MSCs have not been characterized. Here we show that mechanical strain regulated the expression of SMC markers in MSCs. Cyclic equiaxial strain downregulated SM alpha-actin and SM-22alpha in MSCs on collagen- or elastin-coated membranes after 1 day, and decreased alpha-actin in stress fibers. In contrast, cyclic uniaxial strain transiently increased the expression of SM alpha-actin and SM-22alpha after 1 day, which subsequently returned to basal levels after the cells aligned in the direction perpendicular to the strain direction. In addition, uniaxial but not equiaxial strain induced a transient increase of collagen I expression. DNA microarray experiments showed that uniaxial strain increased SMC markers and regulated the expression of matrix molecules without significantly changing the expression of the differentiation markers (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and collagen II) of other cell types. Our results suggest that uniaxial strain, which better mimics the type of mechanical strain experienced by SMCs, may promote MSC differentiation into SMCs if cell orientation can be controlled. This study demonstrates the differential effects of equiaxial and uniaxial strain, advances our understanding of the mechanical regulation of stem cells, and provides a rational basis for engineering MSCs for vascular tissue engineering and regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Tissue-specific stem cells can be coaxed or harvested for tissue regeneration. In this study, we identified and characterized a new type of stem cells from the synovial membrane of knee joint, named neural crest cell-like synovial stem cells (NCCL-SSCs). NCCL-SSCs showed the characteristics of neural crest stem cells: they expressed markers such as Sox10, Sox17 and S100\u03b2, were clonable, and could differentiate into neural lineages as well as mesenchymal lineages, although NCCL-SSCs were not derived from neural crest during the development. When treated with transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), NCCL-SSCs differentiated into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), lost the expression of Sox17 and the differentiation potential into neural lineages, but retained the potential of differentiating into mesenchymal lineages. To determine the responses of NCCL-SSCs to microfibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering, electrospun composite scaffolds with various porosities were fabricated by co-electrospinning of structural and sacrificial microfibers. The increase in the porosity in microfibrous scaffolds enhanced cell infiltration in vitro and in vivo, but did not affect the morphology and the proliferation of NCCL-SSCs. Interestingly, microfibrous scaffolds with higher porosity increased the expression of chondrogenic and osteogenic genes but suppressed smooth muscle and adipogenic genes. These results suggest that the differentiation of NCCL-SSCs can be controlled by both soluble chemical factors and biophysical factors such as the porosity of the scaffold. Engineering both NCCL-SSCs and scaffolds will have tremendous potential for tissue regeneration. \u00a9 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Derivation of SMCs from different origins will provide valuable in vitro models for the investigation of vascular development and diseases. From the perspective of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, an expandable cell source of SMCs is required for the construction of tissue-engineered blood vessels. In this study, we developed a robust protocol to derive neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). NCSCs derived from ESCs and iPSCs were expandable with similar cell doubling times. NCSCs were capable of differentiating into neural and mesenchymal lineages. TGF-\u03b21 induced the expression of SMC markers calponin-1, SM22\u03b1, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and resulted in the assembly of smooth muscle \u03b1-actin, calponin-1, and SM22\u03b1 into stress fibers.

        "title": "Biophysical regulation of histone acetylation in mesenchymal stem cells.",
        "abstract": "Histone deacetylation and acetylation are catalyzed by histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone acetyltransferase, respectively, which play important roles in the regulation of chromatin remodeling, gene expression, and cell functions. However, whether and how biophysical cues modulate HDAC activity and histone acetylation is not well understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that microtopographic patterning and mechanical strain on the substrate regulate nuclear shape, HDAC activity, and histone acetylation. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured on elastic membranes patterned with parallel microgrooves 10 \u03bcm wide that kept MSCs aligned along the axis of the grooves. Compared with MSCs on an unpatterned substrate, MSCs on microgrooves had elongated nuclear shape, a decrease in HDAC activity, and an increase of histone acetylation. To investigate anisotropic mechanical sensing by MSCs, cells on the elastic micropatterned membranes were subjected to static uniaxial mechanical compression or stretch in the direction parallel or perpendicular to the microgrooves. Among the four types of loads, compression or stretch perpendicular to the microgrooves caused a decrease in HDAC activity, accompanied by the increase in histone acetylation and slight changes of nuclear shape. Knocking down nuclear matrix protein lamin A/C abolished mechanical strain-induced changes in HDAC activity. These results demonstrate that micropattern and mechanical strain on the substrate can modulate nuclear shape, HDAC activity, and histone acetylation in an anisotropic manner and that nuclear matrix mediates mechanotransduction. These findings reveal a new mechanism, to our knowledge, by which extracellular biophysical signals are translated into biochemical signaling events in the nucleus, and they will have significant impact in the area of mechanobiology and mechanotransduction.",

        "abstract": "The differentiation of stem cells into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays an important role in vascular development and remodeling. In addition, stem cells represent a potential source of SMCs for regenerative medicine applications such as constructing vascular grafts. Previous studies have suggested that various biochemical factors, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and the Notch pathway, may play important roles in vascular differentiation. However, the interactions of these two signaling pathways in the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have not been clearly defined. In this study, we profiled the gene expression in MSCs in response to TGF-beta, and showed that TGF-beta induced Notch ligand Jagged 1 (JAG1) and SMC markers, including smooth muscle alpha-actin (ACTA2), calponin 1 (CNN1), and myocardin (MYOCD), which were dependent on the activation of SMAD3 and Rho kinase. In addition, knocking down JAG1 expression partially blocked ACTA2 and CNN1 expression and completely blocked MYOCD expression, suggesting that JAG1 plays an important role in TGF-beta-induced expression of SMC markers. On the other hand, the activation of Notch signaling induced the expression of SMC markers in MSCs and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Notch activation in hESCs also resulted in an increase of neural markers and a decrease of endothelial markers. These results suggest that Notch signaling mediates TGF-beta regulation of MSC differentiation and that Notch signaling induces the differentiation of MSCs and hESCs into SMCs, which represents a novel mechanism involved in stem cell differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a valuable cell source for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) can promote MSC differentiation into either smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or chondrogenic cells. Here we showed that the stiffness of cell adhesion substrates modulated these differential effects. MSCs on soft substrates had less spreading, fewer stress fibers and lower proliferation rate than MSCs on stiff substrates. MSCs on stiff substrates had higher expression of SMC markers \u03b1-actin and calponin-1; in contrast, MSCs on soft substrates had a higher expression of chondrogenic marker collagen-II and adipogenic marker lipoprotein lipase (LPL). TGF-\u03b2 increased SMC marker expression on stiff substrates. However, TGF-\u03b2 increased chondrogenic marker expression and suppressed adipogenic marker expression on soft substrates, while adipogenic medium and soft substrates induced adipogenic differentiation effectively. Rho GTPase was involved in the expression of all aforementioned lineage markers, but did not account for the differential effects of substrate stiffness. In addition, soft substrates did not significantly affect Rho activity, but inhibited Rho-induced stress fiber formation and \u03b1-actin assembly. Further analysis showed that MSCs on soft substrates had weaker cell adhesion, and that the suppression of cell adhesion strength mimicked the effects of soft substrates on the lineage marker expression. These results provide insights of how substrate stiffness differentially regulates stem cell differentiation, and have significant implications for the design of biomaterials with appropriate mechanical property for tissue regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Stem cells hold great potential for regenerative medicine, but they have also been implicated in cancer and aging. How different kinds of ionizing radiation affect stem cell biology remains unexplored. This study was designed to compare the biological effects of X-rays and of high-linear energy transfer (LET) (56)Fe ions on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC).A multi-functional comparison was carried out to investigate the differential effects of X-rays and (56)Fe ions on hMSC. The end points included modulation of key markers such as p53, cell cycle progression, osteogenic differentiation, and pathway and networks through transcriptomic profiling and bioinformatics analysis.X-rays and (56)Fe ions differentially inhibited the cell cycle progression of hMSC in a p53-dependent manner without impairing their in vitro osteogenic differentiation process. Pathway and network analyses revealed that cytoskeleton and receptor signaling were uniquely enriched for low-dose (0.1 Gy) X-rays. In contrast, DNA/RNA metabolism and cell cycle regulation were enriched for high-dose (1 Gy) X-rays and (56)Fe ions, with more significant effects from (56)Fe ions. Specifically, DNA replication, DNA strand elongation, and DNA binding/transferase activity were perturbed more severely by 1 Gy (56)Fe ions than by 1 Gy X-rays, consistent with the significant G2/M arrest for the former while not for the latter.(56)Fe ions exert more significant effects on hMSC than X-rays. Since hMSC are the progenitors of osteoblasts in vivo, this study provides new mechanistic understandings of the relative health risks associated with low- and high-dose X-rays and high-LET space radiation.",

Using a rat model of left coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion, local injection of the biopolymers into the infarct zone yielded significantly higher levels of capillary formation, when compared with the saline control group, at 5 weeks posttreatment. However, the degree of angiogenesis was not significantly different among the biopolymers. In addition, the collagen biopolymer significantly enhanced infiltration of myofibroblasts into the infarct area when compared with the control group.

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a potential source of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) for constructing tissue-engineered vascular grafts. However, the details of how specific combinations of vascular microenvironmental factors regulate MSCs are not well understood. Previous studies have suggested that both mechanical stimulation with uniaxial cyclic strain and chemical stimulation with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) can induce smooth muscle markers in MSCs. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of uniaxial cyclic strain and TGF-beta1 stimulation on MSCs. By using a proteomic analysis, we found differential regulation of several proteins and genes, such as the up-regulation of TGF-beta1-induced protein ig-h3 (BGH3) protein levels by TGF-beta1 and up-regulation of calponin 3 protein level by cyclic strain. At the gene expression level, BGH3 was induced by TGF-beta1, but calponin 3 was not significantly regulated by mechanical strain or TGF-beta1, which was in contrast to the synergistic up-regulation of calponin 1 gene expression by cyclic strain and TGF-beta1. Further experiments with cycloheximide treatment suggested that the up-regulation of calponin 3 by cyclic strain was at post-transcriptional level. The results in this study suggest that both mechanical stimulation and TGF-beta1 signaling play unique and important roles in the regulation of MSCs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and that a precise combination of microenvironmental cues may promote MSC differentiation.",

EC migration can be regulated by different mechanisms such as chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and mechanotaxis. This review will focus on fluid shear stress-induced mechanotransduction during EC migration. EC migration and mechanotransduction can be modulated by cytoskeleton, cell surface receptors such as integrins and proteoglycans, the chemical and physical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell adhesions. The shear stress applied on the luminal surface of ECs can be sensed by cell membrane and associated receptor and transmitted throughout the cell to cell-ECM adhesions and cell-cell adhesions. As a result, shear stress induces directional migration of ECs by promoting lamellipodial protrusion and the formation of focal adhesions (FAs) at the front in the flow direction and the disassembly of FAs at the rear. Persistent EC migration in the flow direction can be driven by polarized activation of signaling molecules and the positive feedback loops constituted by Rho GTPases, cytoskeleton, and FAs at the leading edge. Furthermore, shear stress-induced EC migration can overcome the haptotaxis of ECs. Given the hemodynamic environment of the vascular system, mechanotransduction during EC migration has a significant impact on vascular development, angiogenesis, and vascular wound healing.",

Here, we compared the genetic programming and signaling of SMCs in collagen matrix as a three-dimensional (3-D) environment and on a two- dimensional (2-D) surface. By using DNA microarrays with 9600 genes, we showed that 77 genes were expressed more than twofold and 22 genes were less than one-half in 3-D matrix, when compared with the 2-D condition. The higher expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) in 3-D matrix suggests that p21 may be responsible for the lower proliferation rate in 3-D matrix. The expression level of collagen I was higher in 3-D matrix, suggesting that SMCs in 3-D matrix have increased matrix synthesis. In addition, SMCs in 3-D matrix had less stress fibers and focal adhesions, and a lower level of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Overexpression of FAK attenuated the expression of p21 and collagen I in 3-D matrix, suggesting that FAK functions as a molecular switch for cell cycle regulation and matrix synthesis. The information generated in this study helps to elucidate the molecular basis of the modulation of SMC phenotypes by the extracellular matrix.",

        "abstract": "Poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) microfibrous scaffolds produced by electrospinning were treated with mild Ar or Ar-NH3/H2 plasmas to enhance cell attachment, growth, and infiltration. Goniometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used to evaluate the modification of the scaffold surface chemistry by plasma treatment. AFM and XPS measurements showed that both plasma treatments increased the hydrophilicity without affecting the integrity of the fibrous structure and the fiber roughness, whereas Ar-NH3/H2 plasma treatment also resulted in surface functionalization with amine groups. Culture studies of bovine aorta endothelial cells and bovine smooth muscle cells on the plasma-treated PLLA scaffolds revealed that both Ar and Ar-NH3/H2 plasma treatments promoted cell spreading during the initial stage of cell attachment and, more importantly, increased the cell growth rate, especially for Ar plasma treatment. In vitro cell infiltration studies showed that both plasma treatments effectively enhanced cell migration into the microfibrous scaffolds. In vivo experiments involving the subcutaneous implantation of plasma-treated PLLA scaffolds under the skin of Sprague-Dawley rats also showed increased cell infiltration. The results of this study indicate that surface treatment of PLLA microfibrous scaffolds with mild Ar or Ar-NH3/H2 plasmas may have important implications in tissue engineering. Further modifications with bioactive factors should improve the functions of the scaffolds for specific applications.",

Different chemical patterns were produced on substrates with grafted PEG-like films using silicon or polydimethylsiloxane membrane shadow masks fabricated by photolithography and a simple one-step plasma etch process.

Understanding the biochemical and biophysical regulation of neural differentiation and axon growth will help us develop cell therapies and bioactive scaffolds. We demonstrated that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) had different effects on human ESC differentiation into neural cells. EGF was more effective in inducing expression of neuron and glial markers and cell extensions. In addition to biochemical cues, poly(l-lactic acid) scaffolds with aligned nanofibers increased axon growth from ESC-derived neural cells, demonstrating the significant effects of biophysical guidance at nanoscale. To combine the biochemical and biophysical cues, bFGF and EGF were either adsorbed or bound to heparin on nanofibrous scaffolds. EGF, but not bFGF, was effectively adsorbed onto nanofibers. However, adsorbed EGF and bFGF did not effectively enhance axon growth. In contrast, immobilization of bFGF or EGF onto nanofibers using heparin as the adapter molecule significantly promoted axon growth. This study elucidated the effect of bFGF and EGF in neural differentiation and axon growth, and demonstrated a method to immobilize active bFGF and EGF onto aligned nanofibers to promote neural tissue regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) play an important role in the development and represent a valuable cell source for tissue engineering. However, how mechanical factors in vivo regulate NCSC differentiation is not understood. Here NCSCs were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells and used as a model to determine whether vascular mechanical strain modulates the differentiation of NCSCs into smooth muscle (SM) lineage. NCSCs were cultured on micropatterned membranes to mimic the organization of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and subjected to cyclic uniaxial strain. Mechanical strain enhanced NCSC proliferation and ERK2 phosphorylation. In addition, mechanical strain induced contractile marker calponin-1 within 2 days and slightly induced SM myosin within 5 days. On the other hand, mechanical strain suppressed the differentiation of NCSCs into Schwann cells. The induction of calponin-1 by mechanical strain was inhibited by neural induction medium but further enhanced by TGF-\u03b2. For NCSCs pre-treated with TGF-\u03b2, mechanical strain induced the gene expression of both calponin-1 and SM myosin. Our results demonstrated that mechanical strain regulates the differentiation of NCSCs in a manner dependent on biochemical factors and the differentiation stage of NCSCs. Understanding the mechanical regulation of NCSC differentiation will shed light on the development and remodeling of vascular tissues, and how transplanted NCSCs respond to mechanical factors.",

        "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are pluripotent, and can be directed to differentiate into different cell types for therapeutic applications. To expand hESCs, it is desirable to maintain hESC growth without differentiation. As hESC colonies grow, differentiated cells are often found at the periphery of the colonies, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we utilized micropatterning techniques to pattern circular islands or strips of matrix proteins, and examined the spatial pattern of hESC renewal and differentiation. We found that micropatterned matrix restricted hESC differentiation at colony periphery but allowed hESC growth into multiple layers in the central region, which decreased hESC proliferation and induced hESC differentiation. In undifferentiated hESCs, \u03b2-catenin primarily localized at cell\u2013cell junctions but not in the nucleus. The amount of \u03b2-catenin in differentiating hESCs at the periphery of colonies or in multiple layers decreased significantly at cell\u2013cell junctions. Consistently, knocking down \u03b2-catenin decreased Oct-4 expression in hESCs. These results indicate that localized decrease of \u03b2-catenin contributes to the spatial pattern of differentiation in hESC colonies.",

To investigate whether SMC morphology regulates SMC functions, bovine aortic SMCs were grown on micropatterned collagen strips (50-, 30-, and 20-\u03bcm wide). The cell shape index and proliferation rate of SMCs on 30- and 20-\u03bcm strips were significantly lower than those on non-patterned collagen (control), and the spreading area was decreased only for cells patterned on the 20-\u03bcm strips, suggesting that SMC proliferation is dependent on cell shape index. The formation of actin stress fibers and the expression of \u03b1-actin were decreased in SMCs on the 20- and 30-\u03bcm collagen strips. SMCs cultured on micropatterned biomaterial poly-( d , l -lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) with 30-\u03bcm wide grooves also showed lower proliferation rate and less stress fibers than SMCs on non-patterned PLGA. Our findings suggest that micropatterned matrix proteins and topography can be used to control SMC morphology and that elongated cell morphology decreases SMC proliferation but is not sufficient to promote contractile phenotype.",

However, the combined effects of nanofiber organization and immobilized bioactive factors on cell guidance are not well understood. In this study, we developed aligned and bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds by immobilizing extracellular matrix protein and growth factor onto nanofibers, which simulated the physical and biochemical properties of native matrix fibrils. The aligned nanofibers significantly induced neurite outgrowth and enhanced skin cell migration during wound healing compared to randomly oriented nanofibers. Furthermore, the immobilized biochemical factors (as efficient as soluble factors) synergized with aligned nanofibers to promote highly efficient neurite outgrowth but had less effect on skin cell migration. This study shed light on the relative importance of nanotopography and chemical signaling in the guidance of different cell behavior.",

        "abstract": "Biochemical factors can help reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, yet the role of biophysical factors during reprogramming is unknown. Here, we show that biophysical cues, in the form of parallel microgrooves on the surface of cell-adhesive substrates, can replace the effects of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers and significantly improve reprogramming efficiency. The mechanism relies on the mechanomodulation of the cells' epigenetic state. Specifically, decreased histone deacetylase activity and upregulation of the expression of WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) - a subunit of H3 methyltranferase - by microgrooved surfaces lead to increased histone H3 acetylation and methylation. We also show that microtopography promotes a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in adult fibroblasts. Nanofibrous scaffolds with aligned fibre orientation produce effects similar to those produced by microgrooves, suggesting that changes in cell morphology may be responsible for modulation of the epigenetic state. These findings have important implications in cell biology and in the optimization of biomaterials for cell-engineering applications. \u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Electrospun scaffolds are used extensively in tissue-engineering applications as they offer a cell-friendly microenvironment. However, one major limitation is the dense fibers, small pore size and consequently poor cell infiltration. Here, we employ a femtosecond (FS) laser system to ablate and create microscale features on electrospun poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) nanofibrous scaffolds. Upon determining the ablation parameters, we pattern structured holes with diameters of 50, 100 and 200 \u03bcm and spacings of 50 and 200 \u03bcm between adjacent holes on the scaffolds. The elastic moduli of ablated scaffolds decrease with the decrease in spacing and the increase in hole size. Cells seeded on the laser-ablated scaffolds exhibit different morphology but similar proliferation rate when compared with control (non-ablated) scaffold. Furthermore, animal studies indicate that ablated scaffolds facilitate endothelial cell ingrowth as well as drastically increase M2 macrophage and overall cell infiltration. These findings demonstrate that FS laser ablation can be used to increase cell infiltration into nanofibrous scaffolds. Laser ablation not only can create desired features in micrometer length scale but also presents a new approach in the fabrication of three-dimensional porous constructs for tissue engineering. \u00a9 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

        "abstract": "The role of mechanical forces in the development and maintenance of biological tissues is well documented, including several mechanically regulated phenomena such as bone remodeling, muscular hypertrophy, and smooth muscle cell plasticity. However, the forces involved are often extremely complex and difficult to monitor and control in vivo. To better investigate the effects of mechanical forces on cells, we have developed an in vitro method for applying uniaxial cyclic tensile strain to adherent cells cultured on elastic membranes. This method utilizes a custom-designed bioreactor with a motorized cam-rotor system to apply the desired force. Here we present a step-by-step video protocol demonstrating how to assemble the various components of each \"stretch chamber\", including, in this case, a silicone membrane with micropatterned topography to orient the cells with the direction of the strain. We also describe procedures for sterilizing the chambers, seeding cells onto the membrane, latching the chamber into the bioreactor, and adjusting the mechanical parameters (i.e. magnitude and rate of strain). The procedures outlined in this particular protocol are specific for seeding human mesenchymal stem cells onto silicone membranes with 10 microm wide channels oriented parallel to the direction of strain. However, the methods and materials presented in this system are flexible enough to accommodate a number of variations on this theme: strain rate, magnitude, duration, cell type, membrane topography, membrane coating, etc. can all be tailored to the desired application or outcome. This is a robust method for investigating the effects of uniaxial tensile strain applied to cells in vitro.",

        "title": "Biophysical and chemical effects of fibrin on mesenchymal stromal cell gene expression",
        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that have high expansion yields and fibrin is a native extracellular matrix (ECM) material widely used for cell delivery and surgery. MSCs and fibrin have tremendous potential for tissue engineering applications, but the effect of fibrin on MSCs is not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to analyze the role of fibrin in modulating MSC phenotype by gene expression analysis. The results demonstrate that fibrin up-regulated MSC gene expression of vasculogenic (FLK1, ACTA2, VECAD, SM22 and CNN1), myogenic (MYF5 and MYH13), neurogenic (TH and GFAP) and chondrogenic (COL2A1) markers after 5 days incubation. These gene expression results were supported by induction of expression on the protein level for early lineage-specific markers such as ACTA2, FLK1 and MYF5. The ability of fibrin to modulate MSC gene expression was not affected by matrix pore size (80\u2013110 \u03bcm diameter) or Young\u2019s modulus (5\u201325 kPa) and the differential expression of some phenotypic markers could be partially mimicked by other ECM proteins, such as fibronectin and collagen I. In some cases the inductive effect of fibrin on gene expression could be further augmented by the treatment with growth factors such as nerve growth factor. However, the effect of fibrin appeared to be limited, as MSCs did not differentiate into fully mature cells based on immunofluorescence staining after 12 days. This body of work provides a rational approach for studying the interactions of MSC with fibrin, which has important therapeutic implications for the delivery of stem cells. Keywords Extracellular matrix Fibrin Bone marrow mesenchymal cells Collagen Vascular 1 Introduction Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising cell type for tissue engineering and cell transplantation applications. MSCs are multipotent in their ability to differentiate into numerous cell types, including those that comprise bone, skeletal muscle, fat, tendon, heart and blood vessels [1\u20133] . They can be isolated from the bone marrow as well as the spleen, liver and adipose tissue [4\u20136] . Other advantages of MSCs include their ease of isolation, high expansion ratio and limited immunogenicity [3,7] . Currently, MSCs are under investigation in over 30 clinical trials in the USA for treatment of a wide range of diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, liver failure, graft-vs.-host disease and Crohn\u2019s disease [8] . Besides the delivery of cells alone, transplantation of bioengineered constructs also holds tremendous potential for replacing diseased or dysfunctional tissues. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins provide a physical structure to support cell growth, proliferation and migration. Recent studies also demonstrate an important role of matrix proteins in modulating the self-renewal or differentiation of stem cells [9\u201311] . Among the various types of ECM proteins, fibrin is an FDA approved biocompatible matrix material that has been shown in numerous studies to promote cell survival and proliferation both in vitro and in vivo [12\u201316] . In our previous studies we have shown that delivery of fibrin alone or with therapeutic cells could enhance neovasculature formation and attenuate dilatation of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction [4,15,17,18] . Consequently, fibrin may be a favorable matrix material for delivering MSCs to ischemic tissues. However, the interaction of fibrin with MSCs is not well understood. A limited number of recent studies report that fibrin can stimulate MSC differentiation towards the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages in vitro [19\u201322] , but it is unclear whether fibrin can modulate specificity towards other cell types, including those of the vascular, neural and muscular lineages. Since the interactions between fibrin and MSCs may influence their therapeutic efficacy and cell fate when delivered together to the site of ischemic tissues, we sought to determine the role of fibrin in modulating MSC phenotype in vitro by gene expression analysis. We also examined combined matrix and growth factor treatments for further regulating MSC phenotype. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Fibrin preparation Fibrin (Tisseel, Baxter Healthcare Corp., Glendale, CA) was prepared by mixing the fibrinogen (75\u2013115 mg ml \u22121 in aprotinin solution) and thrombin (400\u2013600 IU ml \u22121 ) components, according to our previous studies [17,23] . The standard formulation of fibrin was prepared by mixing the fibrinogen and thrombin components at a 1:1 ratio and then applying the mixture to 6-well tissue culture dishes. 2.2 MSC culture on fibrin-coated substrates Human bone marrow-derived MSCs (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) were cultured in Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium (MSCGM, Cambrex) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were previously purified by the manufacturer for positive expression of bone marrow MSC phenotypic markers, including CD105, CD166 and CD44. For characterization of MSC phenotype on the standard formulation of fibrin-coated substrates, 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells were grown on either fibrin-coated or non-coated tissue culture dishes in MSCGM ( n \u2a7e 3). 2.3 MSC proliferation on fibrin-coated substrates For characterization of MSC proliferation on the standard formulation of fibrin-coated substrates cells were grown on either fibrin-coated or non-coated tissue culture dishes in MSCGM ( n \u2a7e 3). At various time points the cells in the fibrin-coated samples were dissociated from fibrin using bovine pancreatic trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and counted using a brightline hemacytometer. Cells on non-coated tissue culture dishes were dissociated with TrypLE Express (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) stable trypsin replacement enzyme and counted using a brightline hemacytometer. 2.4 RNA isolation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) At specified time points the cells on either fibrin-coated or non-coated substrates were lysed with Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA isolation and qPCR were carried out according to previous literature procedures [24] . The primers of interest included those specific to cardiovascular, neural muscular, osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic phenotypes. Primers for qPCR were designed by ABI Prism Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as listed in Supplementary Table 1. The mRNA expression for all treatment groups was normalized to the level of 18S ribosomal RNA in the respective sample, and expressed as normalized mRNA quantities. The data are shown as means \u00b1 standard deviation ( n \u2a7e 3). Statistical analysis between two groups was performed by Student\u2019s t -test, whereas comparisons for greater than two groups were assessed by ANOVA with Holm\u2019s adjustment. Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05. 2.5 Immunoblotting Immunoblotting was performed according to our previous studies [25] . Briefly, samples were lysed in RIPA buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL) after specified incubation periods, resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies consisted of FLK1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), CNN1 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), MYF5 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), skeletal muscle myosin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) GFAP (Novus Biologicals), ACTA2 (Sigma) and total actin (Sigma). After application of the primary antibodies the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. The proteins were visualized with an ECL Detection Kit (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) and then quantified by densitometry. Protein levels were normalized to total actin abundance and expressed in the form of relative fold change ( n = 3). Statistical analysis was performed by the unpaired t -test and significance was accepted at P < 0.05. 2.6 Fibrin porosity Besides the standard fibrin formulation, which consisted of a 1:1 ratio of fibrinogen:thrombin, other formulations were prepared by diluting the thrombin component 10-fold or 50-fold before mixing at equal ratios with fibrinogen; these formulations were denoted T10 and T50, respectively. Additionally, the formulation consisting of 10-fold dilutions of both thrombin and fibrinogen before mixing at equal ratios was denoted T10F10. To assess porosity, 100 \u03bcl of each fibrin formulation was allowed to solidify at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min before embedding in OCT (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and cryosectioning into 10 \u03bcm sections. To visualize the fibrin pore sizes the frozen sections were processed by routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining according to previous reports [26] . The sections were imaged using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For quantification of pore size, Image J software was used to measure the perimeter ( P ) of each pore, and the equivalent diameter was calculated as P /\u03c0. To eliminate artifacts due to sample processing, the pore size range for analysis was restricted to 20\u2013600 \u03bcm. The data are shown as means \u00b1 standard deviation ( n \u2a7e 3). Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Holm\u2019s adjustment, and significance was accepted at P < 0.05. 2.7 Fibrin bulk tensile properties The bulk tensile properties of fibrin were assessed according to previous reports [27,28] . Briefly, fibrin constructs containing various concentrations of fibrinogen and thrombin were casted in molds forming 2 \u00d7 0.2 \u00d7 0.3 cm constructs. After allowing the matrix to solidify for 2 h the constructs were hung vertically and known loads were applied. The final construct dimensions were measured upon reaching equilibrium after approximately 1 min. The Young\u2019s modulus was calculated according to the equation ( m \u00d7 g )/( t \u00d7 w )/[( l \u2212 l o )/ l o ], where m is the mass, g is the gravitational constant (9.806 m s \u22122 ), t is the thickness, w is the width, l is the final length and l o is the original length. The data are shown as averages \u00b1 standard deviation ( n \u2a7e 3). Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA with Holm\u2019s adjustment, and significance was accepted at P < 0.05. 2.8 MSC studies on various ECMs To compare the effect of fibrin with other ECM proteins on MSC phenotype, MSCs were cultured on substrates coated with murine laminin (1 \u03bcg ml \u22121 , BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), bovine fibronectin (1 \u03bcg ml \u22121 , Sigma), rat tail collagen I monomer (800 \u03bcg ml \u22121 , BD Biosciences), rat tail collagen I polymer (800 \u03bcg mg ml \u22121 , BD Biosciences) or the bare tissue culture substrate (control). Collagen I polymer was prepared by neutralizing collagen I monomer in acetic acid with 0.1 N NaOH to pH 7. The ECM substrates were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C before rinsing with PBS and proceeding with cell seeding. 2.9 MSC culture on fibrin-coated substrates with growth factors To further examine the combined effect of growth factor and fibrin modulation the medium was enriched by the addition of one of the following recombinant human growth factors, namely vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF, 50 ng ml \u22121 ), transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b2, 5 ng ml \u22121 ), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1, 10 ng ml \u22121 ), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF, 15 ng ml \u22121 ) or nerve growth factor (NGF, 50 ng ml \u22121 ) (all obtained from Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) ( n \u2a7e 3). The control substrate for these growth factor experiments were non-coated tissue culture dishes in the absence of growth factors. The cells were used within 8 passages and the medium was replaced every 2\u20133 days. 2.10 Immunofluorescence staining At specified time points samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described [29] . The antibodies consisted of those against vascular endothelial cadherin (VECAD), smooth muscle calponin 1 (CNN1), skeletal muscle myosin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (all from Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 3 Results 3.1 Effect of fibrin on MSC proliferation and gene expression of phenotypic markers We first examined whether fibrin supports MSC proliferation by quantifying cell numbers at various time points. In agreement with the published literature, MSCs cultured on fibrin-coated dishes increased in number with time (Supplementary Fig. 1) [12,19] . We next determined whether fibrin-coated substrates could modulate MSC phenotype across a range of cell lineages, including vasculogenic, myogenic, neurogenic, chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Based on qPCR analysis after 5 days culture on fibrin-coated substrates, we showed that fibrin differentially regulated phenotypic markers of multiple lineages ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). Gene expression was markedly induced on the fibrin-coated substrate for smooth muscle markers. In particular, smooth muscle calponin 1 (CNN1) demonstrated a 2-fold increase (0.67 \u00b1 0.20 fibrin vs. 0.30 \u00b1 0.10 control), smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (ACTA2) increased by 1.5-fold (2.82 \u00b1 0.58 fibrin vs. 1.62 \u00b1 0.52 control) and transgelin (SM22) showed a modest increase by 1.3-fold (1.45 \u00b1 0.28 fibrin vs. 1.09 \u00b1 0.18 control) ( Fig. 1 A). Endothelial marker vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2/FLK1) was up-regulated by 40-fold (1.17 \u00b1 0.53 fibrin vs. 0.02 \u00b1 0.01 control) and vascular endothelial cadherin (VECAD) increased by 3-fold (0.0032 \u00b1 0.0014 fibrin vs. 0.00092 \u00b1 0.00056 control) ( Fig. 1 A and B). In stark contrast, cardiac markers troponin-I and GATA-4 were not detectable in any treatment group (data not shown). Besides vascular lineages, we also surveyed phenotypic markers representing myogenic, chondrogenic, osteogenic, neurogenic and adipogenic lineages ( Fig. 1 C\u2013G). Myogenic factor 5 (MYF5), an early muscular transcriptional factor, was significantly up-regulated by 16-fold (1.39 \u00b1 0.53 fibrin vs. 0.08 \u00b1 0.05 control) on fibrin-coated substrates ( Fig. 1 C). Similarly, skeletal myosin heavy chain (MYH13), a mature skeletal muscle marker, was significantly induced by 34-fold (24.68 \u00b1 15.69 fibrin vs. 0.72 \u00b1 0.87 control) ( Fig. 1 D). Among neurogenic markers, the dopaminergic neuronal marker TH was up-regulated by 14-fold (0.99 \u00b1 0.38 fibrin vs. 0.05 \u00b1 0.07 control) ( Fig. 1 E), and the astrocyte phenotypic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was up-regulated by 29-fold (0.048 \u00b1 0.026 fibrin vs. 0.0016 \u00b1 0.0012 control) ( Fig. 1 F). In addition, chondrogenic extracellular matrix collagen II\u03b11 (COL2A1) was also significantly induced by the fibrin-coated substrate by 24-fold (1.48 \u00b1 0.51 fibrin vs. 0.06 \u00b1 0.03 control) ( Fig. 1 G). On the other hand, the osteogenic lineage marker alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) and the adipogenic marker peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPARG) did not show significant differential gene expression on fibrin-coated substrates ( Fig. 1 G). These results suggest that fibrin could modulate phenotypic expression of MSCs towards numerous lineages, including the vascular (SM22, CNN1, FLK1 and VECAD), neural (TH and GFAP), muscular (MYF5 and MYH13) and chondrogenic (COL2A1) lineages after 5 days incubation. To confirm the differential gene expression results, we carried out immunoblotting assay after 5 days incubation for a subset of markers. In agreement with the gene expression patterns, the relative expression of early lineage-specific markers, such as FLK1, ACTA2 and MYF5, were significantly induced on the fibrin substrate, when normalized to total actin abundance ( Fig. 1 H). Fibrin-coated substrates promoted increased expression of FLK1 by over 400-fold, ACTA2 by 0.5-fold and MYF5 by 8-fold ( Fig. 1 I\u2013K). On the other hand, we could not detect the expression of mature markers such as skeletal muscle myosin and GFAP (data not shown). These results suggest that fibrin could mediate phenotypic changes in MSCs at the gene and, to some degree, the protein levels. 3.2 Effect of physical and mechanical properties of fibrin on MSC gene expression To understand the mechanism of fibrin-induced phenotypic expression, we questioned whether the differential gene expression was related to the physical or mechanical properties of fibrin, namely its pore size and elastic modulus. To address this, we modulated the pore size and elastic modulus by changing the composition of the fibrinogen and thrombin components. We prepared several formulations of fibrin by diluting fibrinogen 10-fold (F10) and/or thrombin by 10-fold (T10) or 50-fold (T50) and found that the pore size of fibrin could be significantly altered. As shown by the H&E stained cross-sections ( Fig. 2 A and B), the equivalent pore diameter was significantly higher in the T10F10 formulation (112.1 \u00b1 15.41 \u03bcm) when compared with that of the standard formulation (83.53 \u00b1 6.81 \u03bcm) and the T10 (86.89 \u00b1 14.70 \u03bcm) and T50 (81.29 \u00b1 16.48 \u03bcm) formulations ( P < 0.05). In addition to significantly modulating the fibrin pore size, diluting the thrombin and fibrinogen components also altered its mechanical properties. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the Young\u2019s modulus for the standard FG formulation was 26.96 \u00b1 8.14 kPa, which was significantly higher than the T10 (9.45 \u00b1 3.10 kPa), T50 (5.29 \u00b1 1.08 kPa) and T10F10 (5.74 \u00b1 1.64 kPa) formulations ( P < 0.05). After characterizing the physical and mechanical properties of different fibrin formulations, we next studied gene expression of MSCs on the four formulations of fibrin. To minimize the possible changes in physical and mechanical properties due to protease digestion or other factors during in vitro studies we chose an early time point of 2 days for the assessment of gene expression changes. Within the range of mechanical properties and pore sizes examined we did not detect statistically significant differences in gene expression of phenotypic markers after 2 days culture ( Fig. 2 D). These data suggest that these biomechanical and biophysical factors did not play a significant role in modulating MSC behavior after 2 days culture. 3.3 Comparison of MSC gene expression on various ECMs In addition to assessing the effect of the physical and mechanical properties of fibrin on MSC gene expression, we sought to determine whether the modulation of gene expression changes was specific to the chemical composition of fibrin. To address this, we compared MSC gene expression on fibrin and on other ECM proteins, namely laminin, fibronectin and collagen I. To further elucidate the structural effect of the substrate on gene expression collagen I was prepared as either a monomeric coating or polymerized thin gel. A 2 day time point was selected to minimize the possibility of biochemical and biophysical changes in the ECM caused by cells during in vitro studies. The MSCs cultured on laminin, fibronectin and collagen I matrices appeared to have an elongated morphology, as on the non-coated control substrate ( Fig. 3 ). On the other hand, the cells on fibrin-coated substrates appeared to form tube-like structures that were consistent with early phenotypic changes towards the vascular cell phenotype. Comparative gene expression analysis of MSCs on the various ECM substrates revealed a number of differentially expressed phenotypic markers. The mature smooth muscle marker CNN1 was shown to be significantly up-regulated only on the fibronectin substrate, by 1.5-fold (1.7 \u00b1 0.51 fibronectin vs. 1.20 \u00b1 0.18 control) ( Fig. 4 A). Another smooth muscle marker, ACTA2, was induced on both the fibronectin- and fibrin-coated substrates, by 1.5-fold and 1.1-fold, when compared with the control sample, whereas collagen I polymer induced a 1-fold down-regulation in gene expression (0.67 \u00b1 0.15 fibronectin vs. 0.67 \u00b1 0.19 fibrin vs. 0.17 \u00b1 0.02 collagen polymer vs. 0.37 \u00b1 0.07 control) ( Fig. 4 A). In addition to smooth muscle phenotypic markers, endothelial precursor marker FLK1 was up-regulated on both the fibrin and collagen I polymer substrates by 55-fold and 395-fold, respectively (0.07 \u00b1 0.06 fibrin vs. 0.53 \u00b1 0.28 collagen polymer vs. 0.0013 \u00b1 0.0019 control) ( Fig. 4 B), although the mature endothelial marker VECAD was differentially expressed only on the collagen I polymer (0.037 \u00b1 0.007 collagen polymer vs. 0.004 \u00b1 0.001 control) substrate ( Fig. 4 C). The gene expression of CNN1 and VECAD was not significantly different on the fibrin and control surfaces at day 2, suggesting that these two genes were induced at later time points (e.g. day) ( Fig. 1 ). With regard to myogenic phenotypic markers, MYF5 was significantly induced on the collagen I polymer substrate by 40-fold, when compared with the control (0.88 \u00b1 0.62 collagen polymer vs. 0.02 \u00b1 0.03), and MYH13 was induced on both the fibrin and collagen I polymer (70-fold and 120-fold, respectively) substrates (0.53 \u00b1 0.43 fibrin vs. 0.94 \u00b1 0.23 collagen polymer vs. 0.01 \u00b1 0.01 control) ( Fig. 4 D). With regard to neural markers, fibrin induced a 67-fold up-regulation of TH and 173-fold increase in GFAP, whereas collagen polymer I induced these same genes by 173-fold and 526-fold, respectively (0.28 \u00b1 0.18 fibrin vs. 0.53 \u00b1 0.21 collagen polymer vs. 0.0041 \u00b1 0.0029 control for TH, 0.20 \u00b1 0.15 fibrin vs. 0.59 \u00b1 0.28 collagen polymer vs. 0.0011 \u00b1 0.0013 control for GFAP) ( Fig. 4 E). In addition, chondrogenic marker COL2A1 was up-regulated on both fibrin and collagen I polymer by 98-fold and 226-fold, respectively (0.33 \u00b1 0.36 fibrin vs. 0.77 \u00b1 0.30 collagen polymer vs. 0.0034 \u00b1 0.0033 control) ( Fig. 4 F), and osteogenic marker BMP2 was 40-fold higher on the collagen I polymer substrate when compared with the control substrate (5.72 \u00b1 2.14 collagen polymer vs. 0.14 \u00b1 0.01 control) ( Fig. 4 G). Interestingly, the effects on collagen I thin gels were not reproduced on the collagen I monomeric coating, suggesting that the structural aspect of the substrate may also be an important factor in matrix regulation of cell phenotype. Together, these findings reveal that some phenotypic markers could be differentially expressed on both fibrin-coated substrates as well as others such as fibronectin and collagen I polymer, suggesting that more than one ECM composition may be capable of modulating MSC phenotype. 3.4 Combined effects of fibrin with growth factors on MSC expression In addition to assessing the effect of fibrin on MSC phenotype, the combined effect of fibrin and growth factors was examined by culturing MSCs on fibrin-coated substrates for 12 days in the presence of growth factors known to stimulate the muscular, vascular or neural lineages, namely VEGF, TGF\u03b2, IGF-1, PDGF and NGF. Morphologically, the cells in the presence of TGF\u03b2 on the non-coated substrate appeared to have a flattened cellular shape and pronounced formation of stress fibers, whereas no obvious differences were observed in the remaining growth factor-treated groups ( Fig. 5 ). In the presence of fibrin the cells had an elongated morphology for all growth factor-treated groups. After 12 days incubation fibrin was macroscopically visible on the dish. On day 12, in the absence of growth factors, only the GFAP gene was still induced by the fibrin matrix, suggesting that the effects of fibrin are time-dependent and further differentiation of MSCs needs other biochemical factors ( Fig. 6 E). In some cases the addition of growth factors to fibrin could further modulate differential gene expression changes after 12 days. Whereas fibrin appeared to have no significant effect in modulating TGF\u03b2-induced up-regulation of CNN1 ( Fig. 6 A) or TGF\u03b2-mediated inhibition of VECAD expression ( Fig. 6 B), the early myogenic transcriptional factor MYF5 was significantly induced in the fibrin + NGF (0.31 \u00b1 0.33) group when compared with fibrin (0.05 \u00b1 0.07) or NGF (0.0013 \u00b1 0.0010) alone ( Fig. 6 C). Similarly, MYH13 mRNA was significantly more abundant in the fibrin + NGF (0.06 \u00b1 0.05) group when compared with fibrin (0.05 \u00b1 0.12) or NGF (0.0015 \u00b1 0.0026) alone ( Fig. 6 D). With regard to the neural phenotype, the expression of GFAP was significantly up-regulated in the presence of fibrin by VEGF, PDGF, IGF-1 and NGF, when compared with growth factor treatment alone ( Fig. 6 E). Since VEGF, PDGF and IGF-1 are not commonly associated with the neural phenotype, these data suggest that fibrin may be involved in growth factor-stimulated pathways that enhance the neural lineage phenotype. Finally, BMP2 gene expression was not modulated by the presence of fibrin, but could be significantly induced in the presence of PDGF alone, when compared with the control group ( Fig. 6 F). These results suggest that the combined delivery of fibrin with growth factors play diverse roles in up-regulating, down-regulating or having no effect on MSC gene expression. To determine whether fibrin and/or growth factors could induce the post-transcriptional expression of mature lineage-specific markers we carried out immunofluorescence staining on samples cultured for 12 days using antibodies against VECAD, smooth muscle calponin and skeletal muscle myosin. In contrast to the transcriptional analyses, no treatment group produced detectable immunofluorescence staining of the mature phenotypic markers, suggesting that fibrin could modulate cell phenotype at the transcriptional level but could not induce MSCs to become mature differentiated cells (data not shown). 4 Discussion MSCs and fibrin are both promising candidates for therapeutic cell transplantation and tissue engineering applications, but the effect of fibrin on MSCs has not been well characterized. Therefore, we assessed the effects of fibrin on gene expression and MSC phenotype and found that fibrin could regulate MSC gene expression of phenotypic markers across multiple lineages. The effect of fibrin on MSC gene expression was assessed at multiple incubation periods ranging from 2 to 12 days. In particular, fibrin alone induced the expression of vascular (SM22, CNN1, FLK1 and VECAD), neural (TH and GFAP), muscular (MYF5 and MYH13) and chondrogenic (COL2A1) lineages after 5 days incubation ( Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, the combination of fibrin and growth factors for 12 days could enhance the differential expression of certain lineage-specific phenotypic markers, including MYF5, MYH13 and GFAP ( Fig. 6 ). On the other hand, fibrin did not appear to affect the TGF\u03b2-mediated inhibition of VECAD or stimulation of CNN1. These findings demonstrate that fibrin and soluble factors interact with MSCs in regulating cell phenotype. However, the growth factor studies were limited by the use of a serum-containing medium that contained trace amounts of growth factors, which may contribute to gene expression changes. Although NGF is commonly associated with neural differentiation, the finding that NGF with fibrin induced myogenic gene expression of MYF5 and MYH13 in the presence of fibrin revealed a novel role of NGF in regulating myogenic phenotype. Previous studies have described the role of NGF in regulating myogenic differentiation and the proliferation of skeletal myoblasts. In particular, exogenously added NGF increased the rate of myoblast proliferation, as well as fusion into myotubes, whereas neutralizing antibodies that block the action of NGF decreased the incidence of myotube formation [30] . However, this is the first report a role of fibrin + NGF in modulating myogenic genes in MSCs. To elucidate the mechanism of fibrin involvement in modulating MSC phenotype, we developed multiple formulations of fibrin by varying the concentration of fibrinogen and/or thrombin and found that the stiffness and pore size of fibrin could be significantly modified in this manner. In particular, the T10F10 formulation had a 30% higher pore diameter than the standard formulation, and all three modified formulations (T10, T50 and T10F10) could lower the Young\u2019s modulus by 60\u201380% ( Fig. 2 ). However, the modified formulations of fibrin, which span a range of mechanical properties and porosities, did not significantly alter gene expression. We also assessed the role of various ECM compositions on MSC phenotype for a subset of genes. Interestingly, fibronectin and collagen I polymer shared some of the effects of fibrin in modulating MSC gene expression, whereas laminin and collagen I monomer showed no significant induction of gene expression ( Fig. 4 ). These results may, in part, be associated with similar cell-binding domains common to the ECM proteins [31] . However, the differences in MSC gene expression when seeded on collagen I monomer or polymer suggest that integrin binding and chemical composition alone may not account for the results observed. Rather, these results imply a role of other factors, such as matrix nano- or microtopography, on cell phenotype [32,33] and warrant further investigation. Future studies would also be required to distinguish the roles of fibrin chemical composition, mechanical properties and pore size on MSC phenotype. It will also be interesting to elucidate the effects of the fibrin matrix on MSC gene expression in three-dimensional culture. The present study demonstrates that fibrin significantly modulates MSC phenotypic markers at the transcriptional level, but distinctive immunofluorescence expression of mature lineage-specific markers could not be detected after 12 days incubation. One possible explanation for these results is that fibrin may have transient effects on the regulation of lineage-specific markers. For example, CNN1, VECAD and MYF5 were up-regulated on fibrin-coated substrates after 5 days, but not after 12 days ( Figs. 1 and 6 ). Another explanation is that fibrin alone, in the absence of additional biochemical or mechanical cues, is insufficient for mature differentiation of MSCs. This is supported by other studies showing a requirement for specific induction media to promote the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, in addition to fibrin [19,20] . To fully realize cell differentiation it is likely that multiple soluble factors and an appropriate ECM are needed. How fibrin affects MSC differentiation into a specific lineage in the presence of a cocktail of soluble differentiation factors awaits further investigation. A third explanation is that incubation periods longer than 12 days may be necessary to observe post-transcriptional effects of fibrin on cell phenotype. Our results highlight the complex cell\u2013matrix interactions that modulate the MSC phenotype. Whereas the role of growth factors on MSC phenotype has been widely assessed [34\u201336] , few studies have examined the diverse lineages of MSC differentiation in the presence of fibrin. One study showed that higher fibrinogen concentrations supported higher ALPL activity and osteogenic differentiation, but proliferation was higher in formulations containing a lower fibrinogen concentration [19] . In another study, which examined the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs embedded in collagen I and fibrin gels, the authors concluded that both matrices could support chondrogenesis [20] . Fibrin encapsulation of MSCs has been shown to promote differentiation into chondrocytes that secrete aggrecan and collagen II [22] . In addition to chondrogenic differentiation media and fibrin, hypoxic (3% O 2 ) environments also appear to induce chondrocyte-like cell types and a chondrogenic phenotype in MSCs based on collagen II expression and Alcian blue staining [21] . These studies provided evidence that fibrin is a potent modulator of MSC osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation and prompted the investigation of the effects of fibrin in modulating MSC differentiation towards other lineages. Future studies using DNA microarrays will provide more information on global changes in MSC gene expression. In addition, how other cell types (e.g. vascular cells, osteoblasts and chondrocytes) respond to a fibrin matrix can be investigated to determine whether the effects of the fibrin matrix are cell-type dependent. 5 Conclusion In summary, this study has demonstrated the role of fibrin in inducing MSC gene expression of vasculogenic, myogenic, neurogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic phenotypic markers. The modification of fibrin concentration by varying the thrombin and fibrinogen ratios affected the pore size of the structure and the Young\u2019s modulus, but these changes to the physical and mechanical properties did not significantly alter gene expression. However, a comparison of various ECM proteins demonstrated similar trends to fibrin-induced gene expression for fibronectin and collagen I polymer. In some cases the inductive effect of fibrin on gene expression could be further augmented by treatment with growth factors. In particular, the seeding of MSCs on fibrin-coated substrates in the presence of NGF resulted in significant induction of the myogenic markers MYF5 and MYH13, whereas the neural marker GFAP was up-regulated in the presence of fibrin by VEGF, PDGF, IGF-1 and NGF, when compared with growth factor treatment alone. Fibrin-mediated gene expression changes were verified at the protein level for early markers of vasculogenic and myogenic lineages, namely ACTA2, MYF5 and FLK1. However, fibrin and growth factors alone did not induce MSC differentiation into fully mature cells based on immunofluorescence staining of lineage-specific markers. Our results suggest that understanding the interaction between MSCs and fibrin could be beneficial in directing stem cell fate for therapeutic applications. This study provides a rational approach for studying MSC and fibrin interactions, which can influence the therapeutic efficacy and cell phenotype when delivered together to the site of ischemic tissues.

        "abstract": "Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) are multipotent and play an important role during the development and tissue regeneration. However, the anisotropic effects of mechanical strain on NCSCs are not known. To investigate the anisotropic mechanosensing by NCSCs, NCSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells were cultured on micropatterned membranes, and subjected to cyclic uniaxial strain in the direction parallel or perpendicular to the microgrooves. Cell and nuclear shape were both regulated by micropatterning and mechanical strain. Among the unpatterned, parallel-patterned and perpendicular-patterned groups, mechanical strain caused an increase in histone deacetylase activity in the parallel-patterned group, accompanied by the increase of cell proliferation. In addition, mechanical strain increased the expression of contractile marker calponin-1 but not other differentiation markers in the unpatterned and parallel-patterned groups. These results demonstrated that NCSCs responded differently to the anisotropic mechanical environment. Understanding the mechanical regulation of NCSCs will reveal the role of mechanical factors in NCSC differentiation during development, and provide a basis for using NCSCs for tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Current efforts to treat myocardial infarction include the delivery of cells and matrix scaffolds. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that secrete angiogenic growth factors, and fibrin has been shown to be a biomaterial that provides structural support to cells and tissues. The objective of this study was to characterize the attachment and viability of BM-MSCs in fibrin in vitro, and then to assess the efficacy of treatment with BM-MSCs in fibrin for promoting neovascularization in the chronically infarcted myocardium.BM-MSCs were cultured in fibrin and assessed for cell attachment and viability by using immunofluorescence staining for actin filaments and Live/Dead((R)) viability assays, respectively. To determine the efficacy of BM-MSCs in fibrin in vivo, chronically infarcted rat hearts were treated with either cells, cells in fibrin, fibrin or saline (n = 9). After 5 weeks, the infarct scar tissues were assessed for neovascularization.BM-MSCs exhibited robust cell attachment and viability when cultured in fibrin in vitro. Furthermore, when injected together into the infarcted tissue, BM-MSCs in fibrin could enhance neovasculature formation by increasing capillary density, in comparison to treatment by cells or fibrin separately. Concomitant to significant improvement in capillary density was an increase in the levels of VEGF in the infarct scar.This study demonstrates the angiogenic potential of the combined delivery of BM-MSCs and fibrin, and highlights the advantage of stem cell-matrix approaches for myocardial repair.",

Advanced glycation end-product (AGE) breakers, a new class of candidate drugs targeting aging-related cardiovascular dysfunction, may be useful as novel adjuvant agents to improve the efficacy of diabetic hypertension (DH) treatment. This study evaluated the effects of alagebrium (ALT-711), an AGE breaker, combined with nifedipine, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced DH. Compared with monotherapy, combination treatment significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, increased the pulse pressure, and decreased the coefficient of variation of the systolic blood pressure. Plasma biochemistry indicated that the concentrations of prostacyclin and nitric oxide were increased. Gene expression analysis showed significantly decreased prepro-endothelin-1expression in the aorta. These results reveal that alagebrium significantly improves the anti-hypertensive actions of nifedipine in a rat model of DH and suggest its potential use in the successful control of clinical DH.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the bioavailability and bioequivalence of oseltamivir capsule in Chinese health male volunteers. METHODS: A randomized, two period, two treatment, two sequence crossover bioequivalence trial was designed, 24 Chinese health volunteers were randomly divided into two groups, each group was orally given single dose oseltamivir phosphate (tamifla) or test capsule. The active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate of oseltamivir in the plasma were determined by liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS/MS) method. The pharmacokinetics parameters and relative bioavailability were calculated to evaluate the bioequivalence of test capsule and tamifla. RESULTS: \u03c1max of the active metabolite were (625.17 \u00b1 147.76) and (633.57 \u00b1 115.28) \u03bcg\u00b7L-1 for test capsule and tamifla respectively, tmax were (4.5 \u00b1 1.0) and (4.5 \u00b1 1.2) h, t1/2\u03b2 were (8.13 \u00b1 1.13) and (7.79 \u00b1 0.89) h, MRT were (12.09 \u00b1 1.38) and (11.95 \u00b1 1.03) h, AUC0-24 were (7 247.02 \u00b1 1 720.33) and (7 506.16 \u00b1 1 454.36) \u03bcg\u00b7h\u00b7L-1. Compared with the reference of tamifla capsule, the bioavailability F0-24 of the test capsule was (105.8 \u00b1 17.7)%. The main pharmacokinetics parameters of AUC 0-24, \u03c1max and tmax showed no statistically significant difference between the two capsules. CONCLUSION: The test capsule and tamifla capsule are bioequivalent.",

PPAR\u03b4 regulates muscle metabolism and reprograms muscle fibre types to enhance running endurance. This study utilized metabolomic profiling to examine the effects of GW501516, a PPAR\u03b4 agonist, on running endurance in mice. While training alone increased the exhaustive running performance, GW501516 treatment enhanced running endurance and the proportion of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-positive muscle fibres in both trained and untrained mice. Furthermore, increased levels of intermediate metabolites and key enzymes in fatty acid oxidation pathways were observed following training and/or treatment. Training alone increased serum inositol, glucogenic amino acids, and branch chain amino acids. However, GW501516 increased serum galactose and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, independent of training. Additionally, GW501516 alone raised serum unsaturated fatty acid levels, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids, but levels increased even more when combined with training. These findings suggest that mechanisms behind enhanced running capacity are not identical for GW501516 and training. Training increases energy availability by promoting catabolism of proteins, and gluconeogenesis, whereas GW501516 enhances specific consumption of fatty acids and reducing glucose utilization.",

The ALK4/5/7 inhibitory activity of some compound was also evaluated in ALK4/5/7 autophosphorylation assays. Compounds 6c and 14c showed relatively potent ALK5 inhibition while weak cytotoxicity. At the same time, compounds 6c and 14c display relatively better ALK5 selectivity versus ALK4/ALK7 (nearly 10-fold) compared with SB431542, a well known ALK5 inhibitor. Compound 6g2 proved to be a moderately selective ALK4 inhibitor versus ALK5 and ALK7 (>10-fold).

In this study, piperidine derivatives were designed as novel HSP70 inhibitors based on virtual fragment screening performed in Dock 4.0, Discovery Studio 2.5 and SYBYL 6.9. A total of 67 novel piperidine derivatives were synthesized. Cell viability assays were performed in 16 cancer cell lines. The emphasis was placed on lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cells (BT/Lap(R)1.0, MDA-MB-361, SK/Lap(R)1.0, and MDA-MB-453). The compounds HSP70-36/37/40/43/46 significantly inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer cells. Compound HSP70-36 inhibited the growth of BT474 and BT/Lap(R)1.0 cells with IC50 values of 1.41 \u03bcM and 1.47 \u03bcM, respectively. The binding affinity of HSP70-36/HSP70 was evaluated by surface plasmon resonance and yielded Kd values of 2.46 \u03bcM. The LD50 was 869.0 mgkg(-1). These data suggest that HSP70-36 may be a potential candidate compound for tumour treatment.",

And the anti-diabetic effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of L312 was studied in db/db mice.L312 interacted with PPAR\u03b3-LBD in a manner similar to known sPPAR\u03b3M. L312 showed similar PPAR\u03b3 binding affinity, but displayed partial PPAR\u03b3 agonistic activity compared to PPAR\u03b3 full agonist pioglitazone. In addition, L312 displayed partial recruitment of coactivator CBP yet equal disassociation of corepressor NCoR1 compared to pioglitazone. In db/db mice, L312 (30 mg/kg\u00b7day) treatment considerably improved insulin resistance with the regard to OGTT, ITT, fasted blood glucose, HOMA-IR and serum lipids, but elicited less weight gain, adipogenesis and hemodilution compared with pioglitazone. Further studies demonstrated that L312 is a potent inhibitor of CDK5-mediated PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation and displayed a selective gene expression profile in epididymal WAT.L312 is a novel sPPAR\u03b3M.L312 may represent a novel lead for designing ideal sPPAR\u03b3M for T2DM treatment with advantages over current TZDs.",

        "abstract": "A series of novel, potent PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonists were synthesized and appraised. The most potent analogue, compound 2b demonstrated EC 50 value of 0.012 \u00b1 0.002 and 0.032 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcM, respectively, for hPPAR\u03b1 and hPPAR\u03b3 in transactivation assay. Additionally, compound 2b demonstrated good glucose and lipid lowering effect in genetic diabetic ( db / db ) mice. Keywords ( S )-3-(4-(2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyloxazol-4-yl)ethoxy)phenyl)-2-(piperazin-1-yl)propanoic acids Synthesis Biological evaluation Dual PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 agonist Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors, belonging to the nuclear receptor gene family. 1,2 Three closely related isoforms, PPAR\u03b1, \u03b3, and \u03b4, have been identified. PPAR\u03b1 agonists, for example, fenofibrate, primarily decrease serum triglyceride levels and increase HDL cholesterol (HDLc) levels. 3 Furthermore, fibrates had also been reported to reduce weight gain in rodents without effects on food intake. 4 PPAR\u03b3 agonists, for example, the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of rosiglitazone ( Fig. 1 ), have been used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T 2DM). However, recently TZDs were observed to produce side effects of weight gain, fluid retention, and chronic heart failure, etc. It also had been proved that the side effect of weight gain is associated with both adipogenesis and fluid retention. And combination therapy with fibrate was shown to be able to antagonize both of them. 5 Therefore, our aim was to design and synthesize a series of novel dual PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 agonists which could combine the beneficial effects seen with insulin sensitizers and fibrates, yet without the unwanted effects mentioned above. The TZDs contain an asymmetric center, of which only the ( S )-enantiomers binding to the receptor with high affinity, but they have been developed as racemates because they undergo racemization in vivo. 6 To solve this problem many novel compounds that are less prone to racemization have been developed, such as l -tyrosine derivatives represented by PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 agonist GW409544 ( Fig. 1 ) and PPAR\u03b3 agonist farglitazar ( Fig. 1 ). These two series are chiral compounds containing S -configuration, which are conveniently synthesized from naturally-occurring l -tyrosine. The X-ray crystal structures of GW409544 binding to both PPAR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b1 show that the tyrosine\u2013NH and vinylogous amide C O form an intramolecular hydrogen bond, which are equival to generate a six-membered ring, and then the group was inserted into a lipophilic pocket. 7 So we designed, synthesized a series of 2-(piperazin-1-yl)propanoic acid derivatives containing piperazine-ring ( 1a \u2013 1e , 2a \u2013 2c ) ( Fig. 1 ). The synthesis of compounds 1a \u2013 e and 2a \u2013 c is depicted in Scheme 1\u20133 . The oxazole alcohol for 5 ( Scheme 1 ) was synthesized following exposure of benzamide to methyl 4-bromo-3-oxopentanoate1 3 8 in hot toluene followed by ester reduction with LAH in THF. The intermediates 8a , b were prepared from compounds 6a , b , respectively, followed by amidation with BOC 2 O. Mitsunobu reaction between the intermediates 8 and 5 using triphenylphosphine and diisopropylazodi-carboxylate in toluene was followed by removal of the BOC protecting group with CF 3 COOH in dichloromethane to afford the amine 10 . Intermediate 10 is derivatized on the tyrosine nitrogen to provide the targeted set of analogues following saponification with LiOH ( Schemes 2 and 3 ). Reaction of the amine 10 with 12 synthesized from 11 with NaHCO 3 provided the 4-phenyl-piperazine compound 13 . Saponification with aqueous LiOH in THF provided the target compounds 1a \u2013 e ( Scheme 2 ). Reaction of the amine 10 with 14 synthesized from 2-(2-hydroxy-ethylamino)-ethanol in the presence of Na 2 CO 3 provided the 15 , followed by amidation with a variety of arylsulfonyl chloride affords 16 . Saponification with aqueous LiOH in THF provided the target compounds 2a \u2013 c ( Scheme 3 ). All compounds were screened for the agonist activity on hPPAR-GAL4 chimeric receptors in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells). The results are summarized in Table 1 . All tested compounds have no agonistic activity for hPPAR \u03b4. Generally, compounds 2a \u2013 c which are substituted by sulfonylpiperazine exhibited higher agonistic activity than compounds 1a \u2013 e which are substituted by phenylpiperazine in both PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 transactivation assays. For compounds 1a \u2013 e , compounds replaced by the bromine group, such as 1e and 1b , showed significantly lower activity. Compound 1a substituted by methyl group at the m -position of phenyl ring showed better PPAR subtype selectivity than other compounds. For sulfonylpiperazine substituted compounds 2a \u2013 c , 2b containing the fluoride as the substituent at the o -position of phenyl ring showed better PPAR subtype selectivity than 2c containing the fluoride at the p -position. According to the result, compound 2b (\u03b1, EC 50 = 0.012 \u03bcM; \u03b3, EC 50 = 0.032 \u03bcM) was the most potent compound, which possessed similar PPAR\u03b3 agonist activity and better PPAR\u03b1 agonist activity compared with listed rosiglitazone, although exhibiting an order of magnitude lower PPAR\u03b3 agonist activity compared with GW409544. The inhibitions of HLF cells (human fibroblast cells) proliferation by compounds were assessed by MTT assay, and results were showed in Table 2 . IC 50 values for 2a \u2013 2c were 134.6, 260.7, and 260.7 \u03bcM, respectively, comparable to that of rosiglitazone (156.6 \u03bcM) and GW409544 (108.6 \u03bcM), and which was probably correlated with the activities of the compounds, indicating that compounds 2 substituted by sulfonylpiperazine are low cytotoxic and excellent PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonists. Among them, compound 2b is one of the most potential. Compound 2b (P633H) was chosen for further in vivo evaluation in the db/db mice, rosiglitazone were used for comparison. Compound 2b was administered at 1\u201310 mg/kg daily by oral gavage for two weeks. The effects on glucose, insulin, Leptin, triglyceride, free fatty acids, and total cholesterol were determined at the end of the treatment ( Tables 3 and 4 ). After 14 days treatment, compound 2b (2.5 and 10 mg kg \u22121 group) demonstrated glucose lowering effects, comparable to that of rosiglitazone ( Fig. 2 ). Moreover, 2b dose dependently decreased hyperleptinemia ( Table 3 ), and is more effective than rosiglitazone at the same dose, which may contribute to the relievement of insulin resistance. 9 Furthermore, compound 2b produced a significant reduction on serum TG ( P <0.01 for 2.5 mg kg \u22121 group and P <0.05 for 10 mg kg \u22121 group), TCHO ( P <0.05 for 2.5 and 10 mg kg \u22121 group), TCHO/HDLc ( P <0.05 for 2.5 mg kg \u22121 group), and FFA ( P <0.05 for 2.5 and 10 mg kg \u22121 group) ( Table 4 ). However, rosiglitazone only significantly reduced the serum TG and FFA. 9 All doses of compound 2b did not show significantly impact to the body weight gain of db/db mice in the 14 days of treatment, as that observed in the rosiglitazone treatment group ( Fig. 3 ). 9 In conclusion, a series of novel 2-(piperazin-1-yl)propanoic acid derivatives were designed, synthesized and appraised. Compound 2b , identified as a low cytotoxic and excellent PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonist, displayed comparable glucose lowering effect and better lipid lowering result than rosiglitazone in the db/db mouse model of type II diabetes, meanwhile it didn\u2019t cause similar side effects as that of rosiglitazone, such as increase in body weight and subcutaneous fat. Further investigations of compound 2b are currently underway.

        "abstract": "The effective anti-HBV drugs on the market are mainly immunomodulators or nucleoside analogs. The uses of INF-\u03b1 and lamivudine (3TC) are considerably limited by their low response rate, side effects, drug resistance and HBV recurrence. Thus, new mechanism-based drugs remain in urgent need. This study aimed to investigate the anti-HBV effects of the novel compound Z060228 and to confirm its anti-HBV mechanisms.HepG2.2.15 cells and HBV-transgenic mice were used to evaluate the anti-HBV activity of Z060228. Conformational changes of the capsid structure induced by Z060228 were detected with high-resolution electron microscopy (EM), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).The HBV DNA replication in the supernatants of the HepG2.2.15 cells was effectively inhibited by Z060228 and Bay41-4109. In the liver of HBV-transgenic mice, the HBcAg content was significantly decreased and HBV DNA replication was also inhibited after high-dose (30mg/kg) Z060228 treatment. Z060228 and Bay41-4109 exhibited similar effects on the self-assembly of Cp149. SEC data revealed that Z060228 altered the equilibrium (a state of stability) of Cp149 assembly. EM data further demonstrated that Z060228 could prevent Cp149 from self-assembling to the correct core particles. Additionally, AFM results showed that a low concentration of Z060228 caused Cp149 syncretizing, whereas a high concentration caused Cp149 to polymerize.Z060228 was demonstrated to be a potential capsid targeting anti-HBV drug candidate. The methods employed here could be used as a general strategy to study mechanisms of self-assembling protein-targeted drugs.",

The binding between LLT-18 and TNF alpha or LCS-7 was stabilized predominantly through electrostatic interaction and H-bond formation. The Arg residues in TNF alpha or LCS-7 were important for their interaction with LLT-18. For LLT-18, the key amino acid residues were Glu1, His2, Met3 and Tyr7. These results suggest the feasibility of screening ligand to single epitope with specific phage clone as the target, and of predicting the interaction between small peptides by computer-aided molecular modeling.",

Compared with the known quaternary pyridinium reactivators, two of the resulting conjugates (7g and 7h) were highlighted to be the first efficient non-pyridinium oxime conjugates exhibiting similar or superior ability to reactivate sarin-, VX- and tabun-inhibited AChE. Moreover, they were more broad-spectrum reactivators.",

        "abstract": "Effects of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) blockade were observed by comparing 9-day and 6-week SR141716 treatments in monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced hypometabolic and hypothalamic obesity (HO) in rats for the first time and molecular mechanisms were investigated. Compared with normal rats, the MSG rats display typical symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., excessive abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, but with lower food intake. Although both the 9-day and 6-week treatments with the specific CB1R antagonist SR141716 effectively lowered body weight, intraperitoneal adipose tissue mass, serum triglyceride (TG), and insulin level, the effect of chronic treatment is more impressive. Moreover, serum cholesterol, free fatty acids (FFA), fasted and postprandial blood glucose, and insulin insensitivity were more effectively improved by 6-week exposure to SR141716, whereas hypophagia was only effective within the initial 2 weeks. In addition, hepatic steatosis as well as hepatic and adipocyte morphology was improved. Western blot analysis revealed that the markedly increased CB1R expression and decreased insulin receptor (INR) expression in liver and adipose tissues were effectively corrected by SR141716. Consistent with this, deregulated gene expression of lipogenesis and lipolysis as well as glucose metabolic key enzymes were also restored by SR141716. In conclusion, based on present data we found that: (1) alteration of the hypothalamus in MSG rats leads to a lower expression of INR in crucially insulin-targeted tissues and hyperinsulinemia that was reversed by SR141716, (2) the abnormally increased expression of CB1R in liver and adipose tissues plays a vital role in the pathophysiological process of MSG rats, and (3) chronic CB1R blockade leads to a sustained improvement of the metabolic dysfunctions of MSG rats.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the influence of C75, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, on adipocyte differentiation. METHODS: Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiation by insulin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and dexamethasone. Oil red O staining was performed and activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) was measured. The level of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) mRNA was assayed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: C75 blocked the adipogenic conversion in a dose-dependent manner and the inhibi- tory effects occurred both in the early phases (48 h) and in the latter phases (8 d) of the process. Treatment with C75 for 8 d induced more decrease in lipid content than 48 h (P<0.01). Treatment with C75 50 mg/L for 48 h or 8 d decreased GPDH activity by 52.8 % and 31.2 % of Vehicle, respectively. Treatment with C75 10-50 mg/L for 48 h or 8 d down-regulated PPAR\u03b3 mRNA expression compared with control (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: C75 blocked the adipocyte differentiation, which was related with down-regulation of PPAR\u03b3 mRNA.",

Two compounds with novel structures, zwitterionic 3-(carboxymethyl)-4-methylthiazol (C6H7O2NS) and a dipolymer (C12H15O4N2S2Br) complex, were obtained. When compared with the forms of sodium salt and dipolymer, zwitterion had an obvious advantage in stability, solubility, synthesis and pH, which made the zwitterion a promising drug.

        "abstract": "Background and purpose: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are attractive targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. P633H (2-[4-(2-Fluoro-benzenesulphonyl)-piperazin-1 -yl]-3-{4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}-propionic acid), a novel PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonist, was investigated for its very different effects on insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in db/db and KK-A y mice. Experimental approach: The action of P633H at PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 was characterized by using transactivation assays. Functional activation of PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 in vitro was confirmed by pre-adipocyte differentiation and regulation of target gene expression. Anti-diabetic studies were performed in two different diabetic mice models in vivo. Key results: P633H activated both PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR \u03b3, (with EC 50 values of 0.012\u03bcmol and 0.032 \u03bcmol respectively). Additionally, P633H promoted pre-adipocyte differentiation, up-regulated expression of adipose specific transport protein (aP2) mRNA (3T3-Ll cells) and acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA (LO2 cells). In db/db mice, P633H reduced serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids and liver triglycerides. It also improved glucose intolerance without affecting food intake and body weight after 15 days of treatment. However in KK-A y mice, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance were not relieved even after a 25 day treatment with P633H. Further studies with real-time PCR and electron microscopy revealed that P633H promoted progression of diabetes in KK-A y mice by increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and exacerbating pancreatic pathology. Conclusion and implications: Although P633H was a high-potency PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonist, with good functional activity in vitro, it produced opposinq anti-diabetic effects in db/db and KK-A y mice. \u00a9 2009 The British Pharmacological Society All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The present study was designed to select the effective dosage range of Z24 [3Z-3-[(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-methylidene]-1-(1-piperidinylmethyl)-1,3-2H-indol-2-one], a novel synthetic indolin-2-ketone small-molecule compound, against tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and to investigate the primary action mechanism of Z24 on the angiogenesis by comparing with SU5416 [3-[(2,4-dimethylpyrrol-5-yl)methyllidenyl]-indolin-2-one] in the selective effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) signaling and Bcl-2-related cell vitality because Z24 is a potential inhibitor of the Bcl-2 that inhibits growth of multiple tumor types in vivo in our previous study. Per os Z24 inhibited dose-dependently the mouse S180 xenograft tumor growth and angiogenesis in mouse subcutaneous (s.c.) Matrigel plugs in vivo. The maximum growth inhibitory rate was 56.1% by 80 mg/kg/day on S180 mouse sarcoma cells; however, the maximum inhibitory potency on angiogenesis in C57BL/6 mouse subcutaneous Matrigel plug model was 50 mg/kg/day. Z24 inhibited angiogenesis in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and invasion and inhibited tube formation of endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with SU5416, the IC50 (50% inhibition concentration) of Z24 on the proliferation of ECV-304 carcinoma cells induced by VEGF or bFGF was 24.4 and 17.99 microM, respectively, which is higher or lower, respectively, than that of SU5416 (14.2 microM for VEGF and 22.7 microM for bFGF). Furthermore, the IC50 of Z24 on the proliferation of Bcl-2 over-expressing HeLa cells and non-Bcl-2-expressing (wild-type) HeLa cells are 11.9 and 24.8 microM, respectively. SU5416 did not exert such a selective inhibiting effect on Bcl-2 over-expressing HeLa cells. These results suggest that Z24 per os has dose-dependent antitumor and antiangiogenesis pharmacological activity. The higher selectivity of Z24 on Bcl-2 protein and on bFGF other than VEGF signaling path may contribute to its efficiency against tumor and tumor-associated angiogenesis.",

After 14 days treatment, GW501516 effectively improved the glucose intolerance, normalized the fasted blood glucose, and increased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. Postprandial blood glucose, serum insulin, leptin, free fatty acid (FFA) levels, and total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio were also significantly decreased. Moreover, semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results indicated that the above phenotypes might be due to (i) enhancement of fatty acid oxidation in muscle, adipose tissue and the liver; (ii) improvement of insulin-stimulated glucose transportation in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue; and (iii) reduced local glucocorticoid synthesis. Therefore, GW501516 could significantly ameliorate dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance in monosodium L-glutamate mice and activation of PPARdelta could be envisioned as a useful strategy against human metabolic syndrome and related diseases.",

After the induction of diabetes by streptozocin (STZ), rats were maintained with free access to rat chow and 1% NaCl drinking water. Blood pressure was monitored at conscious state by tail-cuff weekly till it was 50 mmHg higher than normal animal steadily. Finally, blood pressure was measured by catheterization of the right carotid artery and plasma ET-1 and Ang II, kidney Ang II and angiotensinogen or preproendothelin gene expression in liver or aorta were assayed separately. STZ-diabetic rats that maintained with 1% NaCl drinking water exhibited obviously increasing blood pressure since the third week. Then the pressure reached 150 mmHg at the 6th week and was maintained until the 11th week. Till the 12th week, the blood pressure reached to higher than 160 mmHg. In addition, these high blood pressure rats were accompanied with increased blood plasma ET-1 and Ang II and augmented gene expression levels of angiotensinogen in kidneys and preproendothelin in aorta tissues. Loading sodium chloride chronically to STZ-diabetic rats could prepare a diabetic-hypertensive rat model.",

A preadipocyte differentiation assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the functional activities of C333H. In db/db mice, the effects of C333H were investigated with respect to lowering of blood glucose and lipid levels.C333H was determined to be a novel PPARalpha/gamma dual agonist because it strongly induced luciferase activity on human PPARalpha and PPARgamma, promoting the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes, and functioning in upregulating the expression of some glucose and lipid metabolic target genes of the PPAR. In addition, C333H efficiently reduced blood lipid and glucose concentrations in db/db diabetic mice.C333H has dual action on both PPARalpha and PPARgamma, and might be of interest for the amelioration of lipid metabolic disorders and insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Prompted by the therapeutic potential of the neuroimmunophilin FK506-binding protein (FKBP) ligand, GPI-1046, in the treatment of nerve injuries and neurodegenerative diseases, a novel series of non-cyclic derivatives of GPI-1046 were designed and synthesized. Computer modeling analysis revealed that these relatively linear derivatives could energy-favorably bind to FKBP12 with an analogous binding mode to GPI-1046. The neurotrophic activity of the target compounds was assessed in chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures. As a result, 6 out of 11 test compounds at either or both concentrations of 1 pM and 100 pM significantly promoted neurite outgrowth in DRGs in the presence of 0.15 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF). Compound 5c at 100 pM exhibited the greatest neurotrophic effect in promoting both the number and length of neurite processes. However, in the absence of exogenously added NGF, all test compounds, including GPI-1046, failed to afford any positive effect on DRGs. This study suggests the intriguing potential of these compounds for further investigation.",

Furthermore, in hemodynamic studies of the cardiovascular system, C16 (12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg) treatment for 4 weeks resulted in a dose-dependent and significant increase in cardiac output, a reduction of total peripheral resistance, and an increase in systemic arterial compliance when compared with vehicle-treated diabetic rats. Biochemical studies showed that C16 treatment also resulted in a significant decrease in immunoglobulin G-red blood cell surface crosslink content and an increase in collagen solubility. Morphological and immunohistochemical examinations indicated that C16 was able to prevent increases of the collagen type III/I ratio in the aorta and decrease the accumulation of AGE in the aorta.C16 has the ability to reduce AGE accumulation in tissues in vivo, and can restore diabetes-associated cardiovascular disorders in rats. This provides a potential therapeutic approach for cardiovascular disease associated with diabetes and aging in humans.",

The structure-activity relationship of BMS-397 was studied and the large influence of the groups of pyridine and piperidine on the activity led us to modify these two sites. A series of piperazine pyrimidine derivatives was designed and synthesized. Their structures were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. The activities of all the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated using a chemotaxis inhibition assay. The results of biological activity experiment show that compound 8a was more potent than BMS-397. In the murine rhinitis model, budesonide was used as the calibration or comparison standard to assess the relative efficacy of compound 8a. The results show that compound 8a was more effective than budesonide, revealed excellent affinity to N-terminal of CCR4, and the apparent binding constant of CZE experiment result was (3.6179\u00b10.5976)\u00d7104 L/mol.",

Therefore, the protein encoded by , MCR-1, could be a target for structure-based design of inhibitors to tackle polymyxins resistance.

In the enzymatic assay, we elucidate that  and  could target the MCR-1 to inhibit the activity of the protein. Additionally, a molecular docking study showed that  and  could interact with Glu246 and Thr285 via hydrogen bonds and occupy well the cavity of the MCR-1 protein.

In this study, Z24 was shown to induce human umbilical venous endothelial cell (HUVEC) apoptosis confirmed by morphologic changes including the presence of apoptotic bodies, significant apoptotic sub-G1 peak upon flow-cytometric analysis, formation of DNA ladders upon agarose gel electrophoresis, and TUNEL (TdT mediated X-dUTP nick-end labeling) results. Systemic administration of Z24 at non-toxic dose in nude mice resulted in inhibition of subcutaneous tumor growth of human colon cancer HCT-8, while it did not inhibit this cell line in vitro, with 100-fold more potent growth-inhibition against endothelial cells. The immunohistochemical results showed that the microvessel density of tumor tissue of the Z24 group was significantly lower than that of the control groups (P<0.05), which supported its anti-angiogenic property. We further found that Z24 inhibited the pulmonary metastasis of mouse lung adenocarcinoma LA795, with fewer surface lung metastases (89.6%, P<0.0001) and decreased lung weights (38.5%, P<0.01) compared to the vehicle group. All these findings support that Z24 is a promising angiogenesis inhibitor for limiting tumor growth and metastasis.",

In this study\u2423we show that a novel compound, 3-{4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}-\t2-[2-(2-nitro-phenoxy)-acetyl amino]-propionic acid (O325H), is an agonist with dual effect on PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 by using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. By activating PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 simultaneously, O325H promotes pre-adipocyte differentiation and up-regulates the expression of glucose and lipid metabolic target genes. In diabetic mice, administration of O325H at 10\u00a0mg/kg decreases the blood lipid and glucose levels. Therefore, O325H has dual action on PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 and is a promising agent for the amelioration of lipid metabolic disorders and diabetes associated with insulin resistance.",

        "abstract": "AIM: With the purpose of finding new antitumor drugs with anti-angiogenesis activity, the antitumor activity of Z24 in vivo and its anti-angiogenesis activity were investigated. METHODS: MTT assay was used to determine the growth inhibitions of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402 and pulmonary cells of fetus 2BS by Z24. Trypan-blue exclusion was used to measure the growth inhibition of human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) by Z24. Chorioallantoic membrane(CAM) assay was used to determine the anti-angiogenesis activity of Z24. Transplantable mouse sarcoma 180(S180), hepatoma 22 (H22) and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402 models were used to evaluate the antitumor activity of Z24 in vivo. RESULTS: The IC50 values of Z24 for BEL-7402 and 2BS by MTT assay were found to be 106 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L-1 and 116 \u2034mol \u00b7 L-1, respectively. The IC50 value of Z24 for HUVEC by trypan-blue exclusion assay was 6.44 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L-1. Z24 at 100 mg\u00b7kg-1 inhibited the growth of subcutaneous S180, H22, and BEL-7402 tumors by 52.5% (n = 10, P < 0.01), 41.5% (n = 10, P < 0.01), and 53.4% (n = 6, P < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Z24 present high antitumor activity in vivo, can selectively inhibit vascular endothelial cells, and have anti-angiogenesis activity on CAM.",

        "abstract": "To obtain potential A adenosine receptor agonists, a series of 2-hydrazinyladenosine derivatives were synthesized and assayed for adenosine receptors activity using radioligand binding activity assays. The binding activity of the subtypes was examined, and the structure-activity relationship of this class of compounds at the A receptor was investigated. A fragment-based computer-aided design method was used to modify the 2-position side chain structures with different structural fragments, and the newly generated molecules were docked to the A receptor to assess scoring and screening activity. To synthesize compounds with better scoring activity, the newly synthesized compounds were tested for in\u00a0vitro receptor binding activity. 2-Hydrazinyladenosine derivatives of 32 new structural types were designed and synthesized, with the most potent adenosine derivative 23 exhibiting a K value of 1.8\u202fnM for AAR and significant selectivity for the A receptor compared to the A receptor. In addition to, compound 23, 24, 30, 31, and 42 also exhibited potent A receptor selectivity, with Ki values for the A receptor of 6.4, 20, 67 and 6.3\u202fnM, respectively. We also found that compound 35 has a high A receptor selectivity, with a K value for the A receptor of 4.5\u202fnM. Further functional assays also demonstrated that these compounds have potent A receptor agonist activity. The study shows the applicability of an in silico fragment-based molecular design for rational lead optimization in AAR.",

Previous works have shown that Z24 induces hepatotoxicity in rodents. We examined the hepatotoxic mechanism of Z24 at the protein level and looked for potential biomarkers. We used 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS to analyze alternatively expressed proteins in rat liver and plasma after Z24 administration. We also examined apoptosis in rat liver and measured levels of intramitochondrial ROS and NAD(P)H redox in liver cells. We found that 22 nonredundant proteins in the liver and 11 in the plasma were differentially expressed. These proteins were involved in several important metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolism, biotransformation, apoptosis, etc. Apoptosis in rat liver was confirmed with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-nick end labeling assay. In mitochondria, Z24 increased the ROS and decreased the NAD(P)H levels. Thus, inhibition of carbohydrate aerobic oxidation, fatty acid beta-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation is a potential mechanism of Z24-induced hepatotoxicity, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis-mediated cell death. In addition, fetub protein and argininosuccinate synthase in plasma may be potential biomarkers of Z24-induced hepatotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "To characterize the biological profiles of MJ08, a novel selective CB(1) receptor antagonist.Radioligand binding assays were performed using rat brain and spleen membrane preparations. CB(1) and CB(2) receptor redistribution and intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) assays were performed with IN CELL Analyzer. Inverse agonism was studied using intracellular cAMP assays, and in guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens smooth muscle preparations. In vivo pharmacologic profile was assessed in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice.In radioligand binding assay, MJ08 selectively antagonized CB(1) receptor (IC(50)=99.9 nmol/L). In EGFP-CB(1)_U2OS cells, its IC(50) value against CB(1) receptor activation was 30.23 nmol/L (SR141716A: 32.16 nmol/L). WIN 55,212-2 (1 \u03bcmol/L) increased [Ca(2+)](i) in the primary cultured hippocampal neuronal cells and decreased cAMP accumulation in CHO-hCB(1) cells. MJ08 (10 nmol/L-10 \u03bcmol/L) blocked both the WIN 55,212-2-induced effects. Furthermore, MJ08 reversed the inhibition of electrically evoked twitches of mouse vas deferens by WIN 55,212-2 (pA(2)=10.29\u00b11.05). MJ08 and SR141716A both showed an inverse agonism activity by markedly promoting the contraction force and frequency of guinea pig ileum muscle. MJ08 significantly increased the cAMP level in CHO-hCB(1) cells with an EC(50) value of 78.6 nmol/L, which was lower than the EC(50) value for SR141716A (159.2 nmol/L). Besides the more potent pharmacological effects of cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonism in DIO mice, such as reducing food intake, decreasing body weight, and ameliorating dyslipidemia, MJ08 (10 mg/kg) unexpectedly raised the fasted blood glucose in vivo.MJ08 is a novel, potent and selective CB(1) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist with potent bioactive responses in vitro and in vivo that may be useful for disclosure the versatile nature of CB(1) receptors.",

All monkeys were determined to be free from hypertension, hyperglycaemia and cardiac disease. The normal values of index related to heart and blood vessels including structure, haemodynamics and systolic or diastolic function were detected by 2D, M-mode, pulsed Doppler and tissue Doppler echocardiography respectively under ketamine hydrochloride sedation. Meanwhile, blood pressures were also measured by electronic sphygmomanometer. Each monkey underwent repeated detections in 2 weeks and all data were analysed with statistical methods.Compared with young adult monkeys, the older's heart rate (HR), the left ventricular diastolic function and the compliance of big artery including right and left common carotid artery, bulbus caroticus, internal carotid artery and abdominal aorta were decreased and the associated indexes changed significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Meanwhile, older monkeys exhibited significant increase in the aorta diameter (AO), amplitude of aortic wall (AAO), left atrial diameter (LAD), end diastolic volume of left ventricle (EDV), stroke volume (SV), left ventricular mass (LVM) (P < 0.05 vs. young adult monkeys); however, cardiac output (CO) only slightly increased but the difference did not reach the statistical significance (P = 0.418, P = 0.644 respectively).The present results demonstrated the profiles of cardiovascular function and structure in the older Rhesus monkeys. Older monkey is accompanied by diminished left ventricular diastolic function and big artery compliance. Ultrasonography provides a means to non-invasively evaluate the anatomy and function of the heart and blood vessel, and plays an increasingly important role in the drug evaluation against cardiovascular dysfunction.",

The compound 4-(((1-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl)amino)benzenesulfonamide (27a) exhibited slightly higher inhibition (IC50=0.24\u03bcM) than SB431542 (IC50=0.35\u03bcM), a well known potent ALK5 inhibitor. The binding mode of 27a generated by flexible docking study shows that it fits well into the site cavity of ALK5 by forming several tight interactions.",

Results revealed that all of the target compounds 1a-p show potent antitumor activity, compounds 1e-h (IC(50)'s: 0.45-5.08 \u03bcM) are more active than Sunitinib (IC(50)'s: 1.35-6.61 \u03bcM), and the most active compound 1 h (IC(50): 0.47-3.11 \u03bcM) is 2.1-4.6-fold more potent than Sunitinib against all five cancer cell lines.

        "abstract": "MJ15, a novel cannabinoid CB(1) receptor selective antagonist was discovered. In receptor binding assays, MJ15 displayed a high affinity for rat cannabinoid CB(1) receptor (K(i)=27.2 pM, and IC(50)=118.9 pM), but a much lower affinity for rat cannabinoid CB(2) receptor (only 46% inhibition at 10 microM). At the cellular level, the IC(50) values against activation of cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors induced by Win55212-2 in specially designed EGFP-CB(1)_U2OS and EGFP-CB(2)_U2OS cells were 0.11 microM and >10 microM, respectively. In addition, MJ15 dose-dependently blocked Win55212-2 mediated increase of intracellular Ca(2+) levels in hippocampal cells and reversed the inhibitory effects of cannabinoid CB(1) receptor agonist on forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in CHO cells expressing the human cannabinoid CB(1) receptor. In animal experiments, MJ15 demonstrated remarkable effects from 20 to 40 mg/kg, including promoted the small intestine peristalsis in ICR mice and inhibited food intake and body weight increase in diet-induced obesity (DIO) rat and mouse. 40 mg/kg MJ15 significantly reduced food intake at initial 2 weeks of treatment, prevented the increase of body weight and adipose by 46% and 28% respectively in DIO rats, and reduced body weight and adipose gain by 70% and 23% respectively in early onset obesity DIO mice after 4 weeks treatment. Meanwhile, dyslipidemia were ameliorated in both models. Taken together the in vitro and in vivo data, MJ15 is demonstrated to be a potent and selective cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonist and holds a prominent potency in obesity and dyslipidemia treatment.",

Our group replaced the quinoline ring with a naphthalene ring, leading to a new type of triarylbutanol skeleton. An asymmetric synthetic route was established for our bedaquiline analogues, and the goal of assigning their absolute configurations was achieved by comparison of experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra, and was confirmed by the combined use of circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy.

Compounds C22 and C2 showed favorable HPTP\u03b2 inhibitory activity and better selectivity for HPTP\u03b2 than for PTP1B and SHP2. Docking results suggested that compounds C2 and C22 could not only efficiently fit into the catalytic site of the HPTP\u03b2 enzyme but also interact with the Lys1807, Arg1809 and Lys1811 residues of the secondary binding site, which was next to the catalytic center of the enzyme. The mode of interaction of the synthesized compound with the protein was different from the one found in a complex crystal of small molecules with HPTP\u03b2 (2I4H), in which the inhibitory molecule formed hydrogen bonds with the Gln1948 and Asn1735 residues of the secondary binding site.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Human protein tyrosine phosphatase beta (HPTP\u03b2) inhibitors have been used for the treatment of sepsis, cancer and inflammatory diseases. The phenylsulfamic acid derivatives are a group of powerful inhibitors of HPTP\u03b2. To explore the relationship between their structures and biological activities, the three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model is first constructed. Two highly predictive 3D-QSAR models are established. These models are the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA: q cv  2  0.611, R ncv  2  0.999) model and the comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA: q cv  2  0.588, R ncv  2  0.993) model. The results show a quite good external predictive power for the test set, with R pre  2  values of 0.833 and 0.775, respectively. Furthermore, the contour maps of the 3D-QSAR models are analysed together with the results of molecular docking. The analysed results are conducive to discovering new binding sites and provide a reference for the construction of new potent HPTP\u03b2 inhibitors compounds.",

Cells were exposed to different concentrations of salubrinal (10, 20, and 40 \u00b5mol/L) for 30 min followed by TM treatment or hypoxia for 36 h. Apoptosis was measured by a multiparameter HCS (high content screening) apoptosis assay, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry. The phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2\u03b1) and the expression of cleaved caspase-12 were determined by Western blotting. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was detected by immunocytochemistry.HCS, TUNEL assays and flow cytometry showed that salubrinal protected cardiomyocytes against apoptosis induced by TM or hypoxia. Western blotting showed that salubrinal protected cardiomyocytes against apoptosis by inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and down-regulating the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptotic proteins, CHOP and cleaved caspase-12.Our study suggests that salubrinal protects rat cardiomyocytes against TM- or hypoxia-associated apoptosis via a mechanism involving the inhibition of ER stress-mediated apoptosis.",

In this study, we examined the effect of PP1-12 on ventricular remodeling and heart function after myocardial infarction. Rats that survived within 24 hours after coronary ligation were randomly divided into 6 groups and treated with normal saline, vehicle, PP1-12 at 1, 3, and 10 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d and perindopril at 2 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d for 4 weeks, respectively. At the end of the follow-up point, we evaluated echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters, myocardial pathomorphology, apoptosis, and interstitial fibrosis, as well as the expression levels of important proteins involved in ER stress and apoptosis. Left ventricular geometry and function were ameliorated by PP1-12. PP1-12 inhibited interstitial fibrosis and reduced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in a dose-dependent manner. PP1-12 decreased GRP78 and caspase-12 expression and increased p-eIF2\u03b1 and Bcl-2/Bax expression. These results suggest that PP1-12 efficiently inhibits left ventricular remodeling and improves heart function. The mechanism involved may be associated with the ability of PP1-12 to depress myocardial apoptosis induced by ER stress.",

Protamine (Shanghai Biochemistry Pharmaceutical Co., People's Republic of China) was injected subcutaneously as an angiogenesis inhibitor. The animals were randomly divided into 3 groups according to protamine dose. The color flow signal-pixel rate (SPR) of the images was calculated using the number of pixels showing color Doppler signals as a ratio of the total number of pixels covering the lesion.The SPR of the high and low dose groups were significantly lower than that of the control group (p <0.01). Mean SPR +/- SD in the 3 groups was 0.09 +/- 0.05, 0.11 +/- 0.05 and 0.22 +/- 0.10, respectively. SPR correlated significantly with microvessel density (r = 0.86 to 0.94, p <0.01).CEDU can effectively reveal the change in vascularity in a tumor that was treated with protamine. In addition to microvessel density, CEDU may become one of several independent prognostic indexes of angiogenesis inhibitor therapy.",

        "abstract": "Tunicamycin (TM) is an inducer of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, which genes related to ER stress was induced in cardiomyocytes on a genome-wide scale remains poorly understood. Salubrinal and its derivatives are ER stress inhibitors. However, the cellular protection mechanisms remain unresolved. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured from ventricles of one-day-old Wistar rats. Cells were exposed to salubrinal, its derivatives (PP1-12, PP1-24) or vehicle followed by TM treatment at different times. Total RNA was isolated from cells for RNA-sequencing analysis. The expressions of 189, 182, 556, 860, and 1314 genes were changed in cells exposed to TM for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Five well-known UPR genes (Hspa5, Hsp90b1, Calr, Ddit3, and Atf4) were significantly increased in a time-dependent manner. Six not well-known genes (Hyou1, Herpud1, Manf, Creld2, Sdf2l1, and Slc3a2) were highlighted to be involved in ER stress. Compared with TM-only treated cells, the expressions of 36 genes upregulated by TM and 74 genes downregulated by TM were reversed by salubrinal. In comparison, 121 genes upregulated by TM and 92 genes downregulated by TM were reversed by PP1-12. Most genes altered by salubrinal are in the category of transcription (1 h) and cell cycle (24 h). Most genes altered by PP1-12 are in the category of response to ER stress (3 h) and cell cycle (24 h). Our findings help elucidate the mechanism for TM treatment and may be useful for future drug screens involved in ER stress.",

        "abstract": "To examine the self-association of CD4 molecules and preliminary studies on its biological function by several indirect methods. A series of CD4 chimeras were generated including truncated CD4 lacking the short cytoplasmic tail, deleted mutantsD1/D2 devoid of D3 and D4 and D3/D4 devoid of D1 and D2 by PCR techniques, as well as another three CD4 chimeric genes by fused human Fas cytoplasmic death domain to the downstream of the above chimeras respectively. All these molecules were subcloned into pEGFP-N1, forming the corresponding expression vectors. After introducing into HEK293 cells, gene-modified cell morphological changes and target protein subcellular localization were observed and analyzed by a confocal microscopy. Moreover, stable 293/CD4 clones were obtained by transfecting the truncated CD4 recombinant plasmid into the HEK293 cell line and selected by G418. The fluorescene intensity and rosette formation of different clones was each analyzed by a confocal microscopy and cell adhesive assays. It's seen that CD4-Fas fusion gene could induce approximately 80% cell apoptosis of transfected HEK293 cells, compared to FKBP12-Fas is about 30% and CD4 gene only is 7%. Furthermore, both D1/D2-Fas and D3/D4 Fas chimeras could trigger nearly all transfected HEK293 cells to death. Cell adhesion assays showed that neither the D1/D2 nor D3/D4 chimeras when expression in HEK293 cells binds to MHC class II + Raji B cells. Interestedly, there were two type stable clones among 293/CD4. Fluorescence intensity analysis displayed that one' mean fluorescence intensity value is about twice of the other while cell-cell binding examination showed that the former is capable of forming rosette with Raji cells but the latter. All these results suggest that CD4 molecules most likely could exist as a dimer or even an oligomer on transfected HEK293 cell surface, which constitute a functional form for stable binding to MHC class II molecules.",

        "abstract": "FK506 is an efficient immunosuppressive agent with an increasing number of clinical applications. It has been approved to prevent rejection in transplant patients and be efficacious in several autoimmune diseases. Its immunosuppressive activity results from binding to receptor proteins designated as immunophilins (i.e., FKBP12, FK506 binding protein). Recent studies have suggested that FK506 can promote neurite outgrowth as a 2nd activity. Furthermore, it has been shown that the neurotrophic property of FK506 is independent of its immunosuppressive action. Although the mechanism of its neurotrophic activity has not yet been well elucidated, FKBP12 is identified as a drug target, and much effort has been directed toward the design of FKBP12-binding molecules, which are neurotrophic but non-immunosuppressive, for clinical use. In this present study, the authors constructed a stable cell line, which underwent apoptosis upon treatment by AP20187, a wholly synthesized, cell-permeable dimeric FK506 derivative, based on FKBP12-mBax dimerization. This AP20187-mediated apoptosis was rapidly reversed by the addition of an FKBP12-binding competitor molecule (FK506 or rapamycin), indicating that this cell line might be used to screen FK506 derivatives. Using the screening model, hundreds of synthetic FK506 analogs were analyzed. A promising compound, named N308, was obtained. The results showed that N308 could inhibit AP20187-induced gene-modified target cell apoptosis and elicit augmentation of neurite extension from both cultured PC-12 cells and chicken dorsal root ganglia cultures.",

        "abstract": "To screen NFAT antagonistic drugs and research signal transduction pathway related to NFAT. Four recombinant vectors were constructed. Each consists of three tandem copies of the human IL-2 distal NFAT-AP1 binding site in the context of the minimal IL-2 enhancer, either the sequence from -326 - +46 or the sequence from -89 - +46 (containing only the TATA box), driving a luciferase reporter gene or a destabilized enhanced green fluorescence protein (d2EGFP) reporter gene, respectively. Transient transfection of Jurkat cells was achieved by electroporation with 5 - 10 microg of the above plasmid and one pulse at 200V, 65ms. Plasmid pEFBos-mNFAT1 constitutively expressing murine full length NFAT1 protein was used for transient cotransfection. The results showed that neither of non-stimulation nor PMA or ionomycin stimulation alone could activate the reporter gene except PMA plus ionomycin costimulation. Furthermore, overexpressed murine NFAT1 augmented the activation of either IL-2 promoter or NFAT-AP1 enhancer drived reporter gene compared to the endogenous did. However, the reporter gene expression was nearly completely inhibited by pretreatment for 1h with FK506 at 5 microg/mL and then stimulation for 6-12h with PMA plus ionomycin in the presence of FK506. These findings indicated that such a transient Jurkat cell model offered a potential platform for preliminary screening of FK506 or CsA-like immunosuppressive agents.",

By using covalent interaction or physical adsorption, two kinds of streptavidin coated GMNPs (SA-GMNPs) were prepared. The quantity and stability of streptavidin bound to the GMNPs using different methods were determined by UV-Vis spectrometer. The results indicated that by physical absorption the GMNPs can capture more streptavidin, the SA-GMNPs with either physical adsorption or covalent reaction were both stable in PBS buffer. In contrast, SA-GMNPs with covalent reaction was stable in SDS buffer, while most of the SA-GMNPs by physical adsorption would be eluted from the particles in SDS buffer. Therefore, the SA-GMNPs by covalent immobilization were more suitable for fabrication of bead array. To evaluate the binding efficiency and capacity of DNA on SA-GMNPs, the capture of biotinylated oligonucleotide or PCR products on SA-GMNPs at different concentrations were examined. A magnetic beads array was fabricated by immobilizing DNA-MNPs complexes onto a glass slide using a magnetic field. The synthesized DNA targets with different concentrations were detected with a detection limit of approximately 0.05 nM, indicating the potential application of this MNPs array to high-throughput DNA detection.",

The amino-modified probes were firstly immobilized onto carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and then hybridized with biotin-dUTP products, followed by amplification with ligation-dependent polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After streptavidin-modified alkaline phosphatase (STV-AP) bonding and magnetic separation, the CL signals were then detected. Results showed that the quantification of PCR products could be reflected by CL signal values. Under optimum conditions, the CL system was characterized for quantitative analysis and the CL intensity exhibited a linear correlation with logarithm of the target concentration. To validate the methodology, copy numbers of six genes from the human genome were detected. To compare the detection accuracy, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and MNPs-CL detection were performed. Overall, there were two discrepancies by MLPA analysis, while only one by MNPs-CL detection. This research demonstrated that the novel MNPs-CL system is a useful analytical tool which shows simple, sensitive, and specific characters which are suitable for CNV analysis. Moreover, this system should be improved further and its application in the genome variation detection of various diseases is currently under further investigation.",

In this method one primer with a biotin label is captured by streptavidin-coated MNPs (SA-MNPs), and the PCR products are directly amplified on the surface of SA-MNPs in a 96-well plate. The samples are further probed by hybridization with a pair of dual-color probes to determine SNP. The genotype of each sample can be simultaneously identified by scanning the microarray printed with the denatured fluorescent probes. All the reactions can be performed in the same reaction volume without the necessity of purification of intermediates.

        "abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation of the CpG site is among the earliest and most frequent alterations in cancer. Detection of promoter hypermethylation of cancer-related genes may be useful for cancer diagnosis or the detection of recurrence. p16, an inhibitor of the cyclin D-dependent protein kinases, is a classical tumor suppressor gene, and its inactivation is closely associated with carcinogenesis. p16 hypermethylation could be detected in each stage, which is consistent with the finding that aberrant methylation of p16 is a very early event in carcinogenesis. We have developed an electrochemical procedure for detecting DNA methylation of the human p16(Ink4a) gene. The procedure is based on the coupling of DNA electrochemical sensors with linker-PCR- amplified DNA from human gastric tumor tissue and whole blood cells of healthy human. The synthesized oligonucleotide was immobilized on the modified gold electrode to fabricate a DNA biosensor. The hybridization reaction on the electrode surface was monitored by cyclic voltammogram (CV) and square wave voltammogram (SWV), using [Co(phen)(3)](ClO(4))(3) as a redox indicator. Methylation status of human p16(Ink4a) gene was detected and the results were validated by bisulfite DNA sequencing. A good reproducibility was observed in several parallel experiments. The coupling of DNA electrochemical sensors with PCR allowed quick detection and have the potential of the quantitative evaluation of the methylation status of the human p16(Ink4a) gene.",

Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis approved the reliability of biotinylated amplicon. The MBs composites were incubated with alkaline phosphatase labeled streptavidin (ALP-SA) and chemiluminescene was determined by subsequently adding 3-(2'-spiroadamantane)-4-methoxy-4-(3\"-phosphoryloxy)phenyl-1,2-dioxetane (AMPPD). The optimal conditions of the PRV detection method were 10 microM for probe concentration, 50 degrees C for hybridization temperature and 30 min for hybridization time. The limit of detection (LOD) was as low as 100 amol/5 pM of amplicon which proved that this approach for PRV detection was ultrasensitive.",

The core of the unimolecular micelle is a DOX (doxorubicin) which is an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug, while the outer hydrophilic shell is composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) segments. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis shows that the unimolecular micelles are uniform with a mean hydrodynamic diameter around 250 nm. The mPEG-DOX micelles can be internalized by the cancer cells and exhibit good cell uptake by the fluorescence microscopy. Obvious cytotoxicity is also observed when the concentration (count on DOX) is over 1 \u03bcg/mL.

However, the flocculation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles easily occurs during the silica coating, which limits the amount of magnetic silica particles produced in the St\u00f6ber process. In this paper, PMMA/Fe3O4 nanoparticles were used in the St\u00f6ber process instead of the \"nude\" Fe3O4 nanoparticles. And coating Fe3O4 with PMMA polymer beforehand can prevent magnetic nanoparticles from the aggregation that usually comes from the increasing of ionic strength during the hydrolyzation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) by the steric hindrance. The results show that the critical concentration of magnetic nanoparticles can increase from 12 mg/L for \"nude\" Fe3O4 nanoparticles to 3 g/L for PMMA/Fe3O4 nanoparticles during the St\u00f6ber process. And before the deposition of silica shell, the surface of PMMA/FeO4 nanoparticles had to be further modified by hydrolyzing them in CH3OH/NH3 x H2O mixture solution, which provides the carboxyl groups on their surface to react further with the silanol groups of silicic acid.",

In this circumstance, the overpotential of polarization in the cathode will become large and the conductivity will become much lower with reducing the temperature. A novel type of La2NixM1-xO4 (x = 0.2-0.5) (M = Cu, Co) perovskite-like oxide was synthesized and studied as the cathode for low-temperature, 400-600\u00b0C, solid oxide fuel cells. The microstructure, electrical conductivity and fuel cell performances are investigated. The substitution of Cu or Co for Ni in the perovskite-like oxide improved the electrical conductivity of the cathode materials. The maximum power density 312mWcm-2 with the perovskite-like oxide cathode was obtained in the low temperature, 550\u00b0C. \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The electrochemical behaviour of the niobium carbide diffusion-modified 304 SS (Nb-C 304 SS) is investigated in simulated PEMFC environments (0.5 M H2SO4 and 2 ppm HF solution at 80 C). Potentiodynamic, potentiostatic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal that the niobium carbide diffusion layer considerably improves the corrosion resistance of 304 SS compared with untreated samples. The corrosion current density of Nb-C 304 SS is maintained at 0.058 \ufffd\ufffdA cm-2 and 0.051 \ufffd\ufffdA cm-2 under simulated anodic and cathodic conditions, respectively. The interfacial contact resistance of Nb-C 304 SS is 8.47 m\ufffd\ufffd cm2 at a compaction force of 140 N cm -2, which is significantly lower than that of the untreated sample (100.98 m\ufffd\ufffd cm2). Moreover, only a minor increase in the ICR of Nb-C 304 SS occurs after 10 h potentiostatic tests in both cathodic and anodic environments. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

A 3 \u03bcm niobized layer with dominant niobium elements has been formed on the 304 SS surface and the performances of the niobized 304 SS has been examined and evaluated as bipolar plate for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Results show that the average contact angle with water for the niobized 304 SS is about 90.4\u00b0, demonstrating better hydrophobicity as compared with the untreated 304 SS (68.1\u00b0). The corrosion resistance of the 304 SS is considerably improved by the niobized layer with the corrosion current densities decreased at 0.2 and 0.4 \u03bcA cm -2 in simulated PEMFC anode purged with hydrogen and the cathode purged with air condition (0.05 M H 2SO 4 + 2 ppm F - solution at 70 \u00b0C), respectively. The interfacial contact resistance (ICR) for the as-prepared niobized 304 SS is 10.53 m\u03a9 cm 2 at the compaction of 140 N cm -2. Furthermore, after 4 h potentiostatic tests, the niobizied specimens exhibit much lower ICR than that for the untreated ones. Thus, the niobized layer can act as a conductively protective layer of the 304 SS bipolar plate for PEMFC. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. All rights reserved.",

The lattice structures of samples calcined at different temperatures were characterized by XRD. Shrinkage, porosity and pore size of the porous BSCF as a function of sintering temperature were investigated. It was found that the cubic perovskite structure could be formed after calcination at 800\u00b0C for 2 h, but not well crystallized as seen from some unknown phases, and the pure cubic perovskite structure was formed after calcination at 1 150\u00b0C for 2 h. The particle size of BSCF was less than 1-2 \u03bcm. The shrinkage of the porous BSCF increased with sintering temperature, but the opposite was true for the porosity. After sintering at 1 100\u00b0C for 4 h, the porous BSCF was still in an appropriate structure, with porosity of 29% and electrical conductivity above 400 S\u00b7cm-1.",

        "abstract": "A molybdenum nitride diffusion coating has been prepared on the surface of AISI 304 stainless steel (304 SS) by plasma surface diffusion alloying method as bipolar plate for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). X-ray diffraction data shows that the molybdenum nitride is face-centered-cubic Mo2N phase. The results of scanning electron microscopy in combination with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis spectrometer indicate that the as-prepared molybdenum nitride diffusion coating consists of a \u223c3.5 \u03bcm surface layer (molybdenum nitride) and a \u223c0.5 \u03bcm subsurface layer (Mo and N solid solution). In addition, the average contact angle with water for modified 304 SS is 91\u00b0, demonstrating the better hydrophobic property of the surface modified 304 SS as compared to the untreated ones with average contact angle of 68\u00b0. Potentiodynamic and potentiostatic testing in simulated PEFMC operating conditions (0.05 M H2SO4 + 2 ppm F- solution at 70 \u00b0C purged with either hydrogen or air) as well as interfacial contact resistance (ICR) measurement imply that the molybdenum nitride modified 304 SS exhibits improved corrosion resistance and promising ICR. \u00a9 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The dependences of the phase structure and the component of the BSCF powders on pH value and the calcination temperature were investigated by XRD, SEM and EDX. The results show that the pure cubic per-ovskite structure possessing the exact component is obtained after the precursors calcined at 1100\u00b0C for 2 h when pH is 10. The calcination temperature is lowered about 100\u00b0C compared with that pH is 6. It is concluded that pH value plays an important role in the component and morphology of products. It is mainly ascribed to the different components and morphologies of mother material at different pH values of the solution during the synthesis process.",

The matrix alloys consisted of cubic C15 Laves phase and second phase (Z7M10). With the increasing of Ti content, the lattice parameter of alloys decreased and C14 Laves phase appeared and increased. A little of TiNi phase appeared at x=0.1-0.2; however, Zr7M10 phase and TiNi phase decomposed at x=0.4-0.5, which demonstrated that high Ti content inhibited the appearance of second phase in the alloys. As a result, the storage hydrogen electrode alloy Zr0.8Ti0.2 (Mn0.7V0.2Co0.1Ni1.2), the maximum discharge capacity of which is 354 mAh/g, possesses good rate capability. This contributes to change phase structure and phase composition, which plays a synergetic role in the charge-discharge process.",

The as-prepared niobium nitride diffusion coating consists of a niobium nitride surface layer (8-9 \u03bcm) and a Nb and N diffusion solid solution subsurface layer (1-2 \u03bcm). The corrosion resistance of the niobium nitride modified 304 SS are investigated and evaluated in simulated PEFMC operating conditions (0.05 M H2SO4 + 2 ppm F- solution at 70 \u00b0C). Results show that the niobium nitride diffusion coating greatly improves the corrosion resistance of 304 SS. Self-corrosion potentials of niobium nitride modified 304 SS increase considerably up to 100 mV and 143 mV (vs. SCE) while corrosion current densities remain low at 0.127 \u03bcA cm -2 and 0.071 \u03bcA cm-2 in simulated anodic and cathodic environment, respectively. Interfacial contact resistance (ICR) of niobium nitride modified 304 SS is 9.26 m\u03a9 cm2 under 140 N cm -2 compaction force, which is much lower than that of untreated 304 SS, 100.98 m\u03a9 cm2.

        "abstract": "The effects of substituted Zr by Ti on phase composition, microstructure and electrochemical performances of the ZrCr0.4Mn0.2V 0.1Ni1.3 alloy have been investigated. The XRD results show that the main phase of the ZrCr0.4Mn0.2V 0.1Ni1.3 alloy consists of C15 Laves phase, coexisting with a little C14 Laves phase and second phase Zr7Ni10. With increasing Ti content, abundance of C15 Laves phase and second phase Zr7Ni10 decreases and that of C14 Laves phase increases, and the cell volume of both C15 and C14 Laves phase decreases gradually. From SEM results, the microstructures of the Zr1-xTixCr 0.4Mn0.2V0.1Ni1.3 (x=0.1 -0.2) alloys are found to be dendrite. When x=0.3, the dendrite of the alloy disappears. The Zr0.9Ti0.1Cr0.4Mn 0.2V0.1Ni1.3 alloy exhibits maximum discharge capacity 354 mAh/g and high rate discharge ability. However, it is also found that the Ti substitution for Zr decreases activation properties of the alloys. It is believed that the increase in capacity and high rate discharge capability ascribes to the increase of the amount of C14 Laves phase and the decrease of hydride formation heat. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of both ball milling time and content of Zr7Ni10 on the structure and electrochemical characteristics of the alloys have been investigated. The results show that after ball milling with 8wt% Zr7Ni10 for 1 h, the alloy still maintains crystalline and exhibits the discharge capacity 266 mAh/g at the current of 50 mAh/g after 9 cycles, which is higher 20% than that of the alloy without ball milling, and it preserves 85% of maximum discharge capacity at the current of 300 mA/g. However, alloys turn to be amorphous gradually with ball milling time increasing, especially more than for 3 h, and their discharge capacities decreased sharply.

The lattice structures of samples with different x contents were characterized by XRD. Porosity and density of the porous LaFe 0.8-xCu xNi 0.2O 3 (x=0.0-0.1) as a function of sintering temperature were investigated. It was found that the orthorhombic structure could be formed after calcination at 900\u00b0C for 4 h. The particle size of LFCN was about 350 nm. The density of the porous LFCN increased with sintering temperature, but the opposite was true for the porosity. On the other hand, at the same sintering temperature, the porosity of LaFe 0.8-xCu xNi 0.2O 3 (x=0.0-0.1) decreased with increasing x contents. It is indicated that the dopant of Cu on LaFe 0.8Ni 0.2O 3 can facilitate the sintering of the materials.

The tungsten diffusion-modified 430 SS (W-modified 430 SS) has a black surface and a tungsten diffusion layer with a thickness of 7\u20138 \u03bcm. X-ray diffraction data shows that there is only the body-centered-cubic tungsten phase on the surface of the W-modified 430 SS. In addition, the average contact angle with water for W-modified 430 SS is 93.5\u00b0, demonstrating the better hydrophobicity of its surface compared with the untreated one with an average contact angle of 69.6\u00b0. The electrochemical behavior of W-modified 430 SS is investigated in the simulated anode environment of a PEMFC (0.05 M H2SO4 + 2 ppm HF + 0.01 M NaCl solution at 70 \u00b0C). Potentiodynamic polarization, potentiostatic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal that the W-modified diffusion layer considerably improves the corrosion resistance of the 430 SS specimen compared with the untreated one. The corrosion current density of W-modified 430 SS is maintained at 2\u20133 \u03bcA cm\u22122 under the simulated anode conditions. Moreover, no obvious pitting generates on the surface of W-modified 430 SS after 4 h of potentiostatic testing, while serious corrosion occurs on the surface of untreated 430 SS.",

        "abstract": "Remarkable volume changes (u003e300%) and poor electrical conductivity hinder the commercial application of silicon in lithium ion batteries despite the fact that it delivers a high theoretic capacity of 4200 mA h g\u22121. Thus, a novel Si@rGO/g-C3N4 hybrid with a 3D porous sandwiched architecture, where silicon nanoparticles are anchored uniformly onto a rGO/g-C3N4 hybrid matrix via interface chemical bonding, is synthesized by a facile combined method of template-free self-assembly and heat-treatment. This sandwiched Si@rGO/g-C3N4 hybrid anode material exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1354.8 mA h g\u22121 at 0.1C and an ultra-long cycle life of 1000 cycles at 0.5C. A capacity loss of only 0.019% per cycle at 0.5C is achieved with a coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, even after 1000 cycles. The outstanding cycling performance could be attributed to the interface bonding between the surface Si NPs (silicon nanoparticles) and N-doped rGO/g-C3N4, which not only creates inert domains for controllable lithium ion intercalation, but also configures a relatively stable mechanical structure on cycling. The reported approach provides a viable strategy to synthesise ultra-long-life silicon anode materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The development of high performance cathode materials is of importance for the widespread application of lithium-ion batteries in advanced energy storage devices. V 2 O 5  is an attractive cathode candidate for lithium ion batteries owing to its high capacity as well as abundant source and low cost. In this work, Ce-doped V 2 O 5  microspheres were fabricated by a combine method of one-step solvothermal process and subsequently annealing treatment. The electrochemical performance of V 2 O 5  microspheres was enhanced dramatically by Ce-doping. Ce 0.1 V 2 O 5  microspheres exhibit a high initial reversible capacity of 280.7\u202fmAhg \u22121  at 0.5C and an excellent rate capability of 163.1\u202fmAhg \u22121  at 10C. The discharge capacity of Ce 0.1 V 2 O 5  microspheres could maintain up to 193.7\u202fmAhg \u22121  with a capacity retention of about 88.93% even after 200 cycles, displaying a good cycling stability. The improved electrochemical properties of the synthesized Ce-doped V 2 O 5  microspheres can be attributed to the lattice expansion upon Ce ions doping that can enhance the Li +  diffusion coefficient of electrodes. Meanwhile, Ce-doped V 2 O 5  microspheres is constructed with aggregated nanoparticles, which is benefit for superior Li +  transportation and structural stability. The Ce-doped V 2 O 5  microspheres could be utilized as a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.",

The niobium nitride-modified AISI316L stainless steel (Nb\u2013N 316L SS) has a compact and successive niobium nitride diffusion layer with a single cubic NbN phase. The corrosion resistance and surface conductivity of Nb\u2013N 316L SS are systematically investigated in the simulated anodic environments of DFAFC (0.05\u00a0M\u00a0H 2 SO 4 \u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0ppm HF\u00a0+\u00a0x M formic acid (x\u00a0=\u00a02, 5, 10 and 15) at 50\u00a0\u00b0C). The potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarization tests demonstrate that the corrosion resistance of 316L SS is distinctly ameliorated in the simulated DFAFC environments after the PSDA modification. The interfacial contact resistances (ICR) of Nb\u2013N 316L SS are much smaller than those of bare 316L SS before and after potentiostatic polarization tests.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Titanium/niobium oxides have drawn wide attention due to their attractive high lithium-intercalation voltage avoiding the formation of solid electrochemical interface. However, their poor electronic conductivity hinders the commercial applications because of the low electrochemical kinetics in lithiating and de-lithiating process. In the study, new approach to improving the low conductivity of the conventional oxides in micrometers are tactically proposed via the synergic effect of highly mixed multiphase oxide nanocrystals. Ti-Nb oxide composite microspheres with hierarchical microstructure are fabricated successfully via a very facile method combined solvothermal process and calcination. Interconnected crystalline nanoparticles of TiO 2 , Nb 2 O 5  and TiNb 2 O 7  nanocrystals are involved in the obtained Ti-Nb oxides, demonstrating high structure stability during electrochemical reaction. Meanwhile, the ionic/electronic conductivity is remarkably enhanced by the defects of O 2\u2212  vacancies and Ti 3+ /Nb 4+  ions. The remained specific capacity of the multiphase Ti-Nb oxides is up to 185.3\u00a0mAh g \u22121  at 5\u00a0C with very weak capacity fade of 5.3% after 1800 cycles, showing a very long cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to decrease oxide growth kinetics, maintain suitable conductivity and prevent Cr-volatilization of AISI 430 stainless steels (430 SS) as the interconnect for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), a Co Ni O spinel oxide protective coating has been successfully fabricated on the 430 SS specimen using a simple and cheap process with two steps: 1) electroplation of Co Ni alloy layer and 2) pre-oxidation treatment to convert the Co Ni alloy into spinel oxide. The Co Ni O spinel layer on the 430 SS (Co Ni O 430 SS) is dense and uniform with 8\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm thickness. And the Co Ni O spinel oxide protective coating consists of a main face-centered-cubic (fcc) NiCo 2 O 4  spinel phase and a minor fcc NiO phase. Compared with bare 430 SS, the oxidation resistance and the conductivity of the Co Ni O 430 SS have been improved remarkably under simulated typical SOFC operating cathode conditions (at 800\u00a0\u00b0C in air). After an isothermal oxidation test at 800\u00a0\u00b0C, the area specific resistance (ASR) of Co Ni O 430 SS is much lower and stable (0.1\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm 2  for 100\u00a0h and 0.9\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm 2  for 600\u00a0h) than that of bare 430 SS (1.2\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm 2  for 100\u00a0h and 2.4\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm 2  for 600\u00a0h).

        "abstract": "In order to make full use of wheat straw ash which is abundant and causes some serious environmental problems in the north of China, an environmentally friendly route is proposed to convert the wheat straw ash to useful materials in this paper. In this route, low surface area SiO2 microspheres are obtained from wheat straw ash, with the activated carbon and Nitrogen\u2013Phosphorus\u2013Potassium (NPK) compound fertilizer as by-products. KOH is used as the silica extraction reagent and H3PO4 is the precipitator. The resulting SiO2 microspheres with narrow size distribution have an amorphous structure with diameters of approximately 480 nm and a specific surface area of 47.79 m2 g\u22121 under the optimized synthesis conditions with a volume ratio of 1\u2006:\u20061.5\u2006:\u20061 for extract/water/ethanol, a pH value of 8 and H3PO4 solution dripping rate of 3 mL min\u22121. In this optimized route, the yields of SiO2 and activated carbon reach 96.77% and 71.89%, respectively. The waste water produced in this process is used to produce NPK compound fertilizer. The whole route is an environmentally friendly process without any emission of pollution.",

However, its poor cycling stability limits its commercial application due to its dramatic volumetric shrinking and expanding in the crystal lattice during the lithiation and de-lithiation process. In the study, a Si@Nb2O5 nanocomposite is successfully fabricated via a facile solvothermal method with silicon nanoparticles and niobium chloride as the precursors. The coating layer of Nb2O5 improves the electrochemical stability on cycling dramatically. The high reversible capacity and the excellent cycling performance of the Si@Nb2O5 nanocomposite are demonstrated, with a retained specific capacity of up to 2256.4 mA h g\u22121 after 80 cycles and a coulombic efficiency approaching 99%.",

Myocardial changes under light microscope and transmission electronic microscope were observed. TLR4 expressions at protein and mRNA levels were detected by immunohistochemistry and realtime RT-PCR respectively.

(2) Positive TLR4 protein staining was visualized in both Sham and IR groups and significantly increased and peaked at 1 hour of reperfusion in IR group. (3) Compared to Sham group, TLR4 mRNA level was upregulated in myocardium in IR group and peaked at 1 hour of reperfusion. (4) Concentration of TNF-alpha in IR group was significantly higher than that of Sham group at corresponding time points (all P < 0.05), and myocardial TLR4 mRNA level correlated positively with myocardial TNF-alpha (r = 0.728, P < 0.01).Expression of TLR4 in myocardium during early after myocardial ischemia reperfusion was upregulated and actived TLR4 might play an important role in MI/RI through promoting myocardial TNF-alpha excretion.",

        "title": "Effects of adenosine preconditioning on cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by reperfusion",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemia/reperfusion injury can cause the necrosis of cardiomyocyte, and it can also induce cell apoptosis. However, cell apoptosis may be the main death type of cardiomyocyte at the early stage of infarction, and it may be one of causes for expanding myocardial infarction area. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to observe the anti-apoptotic effect of adenosine (ADO) preconditioning on cardiomyocytes during the ischemia/reperfusion, and to investigate the role of apoptosis-related gene protein Bcl-2 and Bax. DESIGN: A randomized controlled animal experiment. SETTING: First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University&Department of Cardiology, Yichang Central People's Hospital. MATERIALS: Thirty-six healthy male rabbits of clean grade, weighing 2.5 to 3.0 kg, were provided by Laboratory Animal Department, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The protocol was carried out in accordance with animal ethics guidelines for the use and care of animals. All rabbits were divided into 3 groups according to random number table. There were 12 animals in either control, ADO or ADO+DPCPX (an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist). METHODS: This experiment was carried out in the Central Laboratory, China Three Gorges University between October 2005 and October 2006. Ex vivo rabbit myocardial ischemia/reperfusion models were prepared. After being anesthetized, the rabbits were performed anticoagulation with heparin and carried out Langendorff retroperfusion. In the control group, the hearts of animals subjected to 40 minutes of ischemia and 60 minutes of reperfusion. Six of them were used for determining myocardial infarct size after reperfusion, another six for cardiomyocyte apoptosis, gene expression and ultrastructural analysis of myocardium. In the ADO group: The ADO hearts were continuously infused with 10 \u03bcmol/L of adenosine 30 minutes before ischemia, and operated according to the requirement of control group. In the DPCPX group: the isolated hearts of animals were infused for 15 minutes with 10 mmol/L of DPCPX 45 minutes before ischemia, and operated in accordance with ADO group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: \u2460 The heart rate and blood pressure of animals in 3 groups were measured during ischemia/reperfusion process. \u2461 The infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride(TTC) staining. \u2462 The apoptotic index of cardiomyocytes was detected by histological TUNEL staining and DNA ladder on agarose gel electrophoresis.\u2463 Apoptosis-related protein Bcl-2 and Bax expressions were detected by in situ immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Thirty-six rabbits were enrolled in the final analysis. \u2460 Comparison of heart rate and blood pressure: During the process of ischemia/reperfusion, both heart rate and blood pressure were persistently decreased significantly (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in two indexes between any two groups (P > 0.05). \u2461Comparison of myocardial infarct size: There were no significant differences in myocardial infarct size among the control group, ADO group and DPCPX group (P > 0.05). The myocardial infarct size of rabbits in the ADO group was significantly smaller than that in the control group. It suggested that ADO preconditioning could contract the myocardial infarct size of rabbits. The myocardial infarct size of rabbits in the ADO+DPCPX group was significantly larger than that in the ADO group, but significantly smaller than that in the control group (P < 0.01). It suggested that DPCPX could partially inhibit the protective effect of ADO. \u2462 Comparison of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes: Apoptotic cells were not found in the non-ischemic myocardial tissue, but found in the infarct tissue and infarct edge ischemic tissue. Apoptotic cells in the control group and ADO+DPCPX group were significantly more than those in the ADO group. Apoptotic index in the control group and ADO+DPCPX group was significantly higher than that in the control group, respectively (P < 0.01). \u2463 Comparison of apoptosis-related protein expression: The absorbance of Bax in the ADO group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.01). The absorbance of Bax in the ADO+ DPCPX group was significantly lower than that in the control group, but significantly higher than that in the ADO group (P < 0.01). The value of Bcl-2/Bax in the control group was significantly lower than that in the ADO group (P < 0.01). The value of Bcl-2/Bax in the ADO+ DPCPX group was significantly higher than that in the control group, but significantly higher than that in the ADO group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Exogenous ADO inhibits reperfusion-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, which is partially mediated by DPCPX; Down-regulation of apoptosis-related Bax protein plays an important role in the anti-apoptotic effect of exogenous ADO.",

        "abstract": "Objective To verify the hypothesis that delayed protection of adenosine against ischemia-perfusion injury is mediated by opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels(KATP)and up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase(iNOS).Methods Forty-eight rabbits were randomly divided into four groups(12 each),i.e.saline control group:rabbits were given saline treatment 24h before ischemia;CCPA group:rabbits were given CCPA(an adenosine receptor A1 agonist)24h before ischemia;Gli group:rabbits were given KATP blocker glibenclamide(Gli)30min before ischemia;and CCPA/Gli group:rabbits were given CCPA 24h before ischemia and then Gli 30min before ischemia.All hearts were isolated and perfused in a working mode,and then subjected to 30min of global ischemia followed by 30min of reperfusion.Hemodynamic data were recorded before and after ischemia-reperfusion.CK,LDH,ATP and NO were determined after reperfusion.Infarct size was measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining,and iNOS expression was determined by semi-quantity reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR).Results Compared with that in saline control group,CCPA produced improvement in postischemic CO,LVSP and LVEDP(P<0.01),while Gli inhibited the cardioprotective effect;CCPA caused a significant reduction in infarction size(13.4%\u00b12.3% vs 32.1%\u00b14.5%,P<0.01)and concentrations of LDH(30.11\u00b13.32U/L vs 89.43\u00b15.76U/L,P<0.01)and CK(42.77\u00b15.48U/L vs 143.76\u00b111.20U/L,P<0.01),while such beneficial effects were also blocked by Gli.CCPA enhanced the production of NO(31.4\u00b15.3\u03bcmol/L vs 24.6\u00b13.3\u03bcmol/L,P<0.01)and up-regulated the expression of iNOS(1.68\u00b10.22 vs 0.96\u00b10.17,P<0.01),which was not inhibited by Gli.Conclusions It is suggested that delayed protective effect by ischemic preconditioning can be simulated by CCPA,and NO synthesized by iNOS may activate KATP and mildly up-regulate the iNOS expression,which plays an important role in the delayed protection effect of adenosine.",

Apoptic cardiomyocytes was detected by TUNEL staining and by DNA ladder on agarose gel electrophoresis. Bax and Bcl-2 expression in myocardium was analyzed by immunohistochemical technique. The mRNA expression of PAR-2 was determined by Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).(1) The apoptosis index and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax were significantly increased in IR group and SLIGRL-NH2 groups than those in sham group (P < 0.05-0.01). (2) Compared with I/R group, the apoptosis index and the expression of Bax were significantly reduced while the expression of Bcl-2 and PAR-2 mRNA were significantly upregulated by SLIGRL-NH2 in a dose-dependent manner. (3) DNA Agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated that DNA ladder existed in I/R and 0.5 mg/kg SLIGRL-NH2 group, but not in 1, 3 mg/kg SLIGRL-NH2 groups.PAR-2 agonist SLIGRL-NH2 could reduce myocardial apoptosis by upregulating the Bcl-2 and PAR-2 mRNA level and downregulating Bax expression in a dose-dependent manner in this rat I/R model.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.\n The activated TLR4 is capable of activating a variety of proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)\n and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Valsartan as a kind of Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers is gradually used for the treatment\n of ischemic heart disease depending on its anti-inflammation function. Therefore, we hypothesized that valsartan protects\n against myocardial I/R injury by suppressing TLR4 activation. We constructed the rat model of myocardial I/R injury. The rats\n were pretreated with valsartan for 2\u00a0weeks, and then subjected to 30\u00a0min ischemia and 2\u00a0h reperfusion. TLR4 and Nuclear factor\n kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. In order to evaluate myocardial damage,\n the myocardial infarct size, histopathologic changes, and the release of myocardial enzymes, proinflammation cytokines and\n Angiotensin II were analyzed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, light microscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent\n assay (ELISA), respectively. Valsartan preconditioning inhibited TLR4 and NF-\u03baB expressions concomitant with an improvement\n in myocardial injury, such as smaller infarct size, fewer release of myocardial enzymes, and proinflammation mediators. These\n findings suggest that valsartan plays a pivotal role in the protective effects on myocardial I/R injury. This protection mechanism\n is possibly due to its anti-inflammation function via TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the protective effect and mechanism of adenosine postconditioning on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.Methods Forty-eight healthy male SD(Sprague-Dawley)rats were randomly divided into four groups(n=12 each):Sham group,IR(ischemia reperfusion)group,IPTC(ischemic postconditioning)group and ADOP(adenosine postconditioning)group to establish the models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.Myocardial infarct size(TTC staining),NF-\u03baB mRNA expression(RT-PCR),the concentration of IL-6(ELISA),MDA,SOD were all measured at the end of ischemia-reperfusion,and light microscope was used to observe histopathological changes of myocardium.Results The injury to the myocardium was severe in the IR group,and the histopathological changes of the myocardium were relieved obviously in both IPTC and ADOP groups.There were no changes observed in the sham group.Compared with IR group,myocardial Infarct size,the expression of NF-\u03baB mRNA,the level of MDA,and the concentration of IL-6 in myocardial tissue decreased markedly(P<0.01)in ADOP group,while the level of SOD increased significantly(P<0.01).However,the differences between ADOP group and IPTC group were not significant(P>0.05),except the expression of NF-\u03baB mRNA and excretion of IL-6 in ADOP group were a little lower than those in IPTC group(P<0.05).Conclusion ADOP can increase antioxidant activity and inhibit the excretion of inflammatory factors induced by actived NF-\u03baB after reperfusion to attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.Reduced the synthesis and release of oxygen free radicals and inhibited the inflammation induced by NF-\u03baB at the early stage of myocardial ischemia reperfusion are involved in the mechanism.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the role of high mobility group [corrected] box 1 (HMGB1) and its receptor toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) on neutrophils in myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. We constructed TLR4-mutant (C3H/HeJ) and control (C3H/HeN) mouse models of myocardial I/R injury and subjected the mice to 30 min of ischemia and 6h of reperfusion. Light microscope was used to observe structural changes in the myocardium. HMGB1 levels were measured using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Neutrophil accumulation, TNF-a expression and IL-8 levels were analyzed via myeloperoxidase (MPO) biochemical studies, quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. The results demonstrated that fewer neutrophils infiltrated in the myocardium of TLR4-mutant mice after myocardial I/R and that TLR4 deficiency markedly decreased the ischemic injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion, and inhibited the expression of HMGB1, TNF-a, and IL-8, all of which were up-regulated by ischemia/reperfusion. These findings suggest that HMGB1 plays a central role in recruiting neutrophils during myocardial I/R leading to worsened myocardial I/R injury. This recruitment mechanism is possibly due to its inflammatory and chemokine functions based on the TLR4-dependent pathway.",

        "abstract": "Pituitary tumors are generally intracranial neoplasms with high incidence and mortality rates. The investigation of novel factors involved in the tumorigenesis of pituitary tumors and the characterization of the underlying molecular mechanisms is urgently required for the diagnosis and treatment of pituitary tumors. Accumulating evidence has indicated that microRNAs (miRs) serve important roles in the initiation and progression of cancer. The present study found that miR\u20111 was significantly downregulated in pituitary tumor tissues upon reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Decreased expression of miR\u20111 was associated with the progression and worse prognosis of patients with pituitary tumors. The MTT assay showed that overexpression of miR\u20111 significantly suppressed proliferation. Highly expressed miR\u20111 promoted the apoptosis of pituitary tumor cells upon fluorescence\u2011activated cell sorting analysis. Further molecular study revealed that glucose\u20116\u2011phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and rate\u2011limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), was one of the targets of miR\u20111. Western blot assays showed that overexpression of miR\u20111 significantly decreased the protein level of G6PD in pituitary tumor cells without changing the mRNA level of G6PD. Consequently, oxidative PPP flux analysis revealed that suppression of G6PD by miR\u20111 decreased the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and the glycolysis of pituitary cancer cells. Restoration of the expression of G6PD significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR\u20111 on the PPP and the growth of pituitary tumor cells. Collectively, the present results uncovered the critical involvement of miR\u20111 in pituitary tumors, indicating that miR\u20111 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pituitary tumors.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4\u00a0(TLR4) serves as an important inducer of apoptotic and autophagic responses in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion\u00a0(I/R) injury\u00a0(MIRI). Radioprotective 105\u00a0kDa protein\u00a0(RP105) is a specific inhibitor of TLR4. However, the molecular mechanisms by which RP105 represses myocardial apoptosis and autophagy through TLR4\u2011mediated signaling during I/R have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to examine whether adenovirus-mediated RP105 overexpression repressed myocardial apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting the TLR4-driven mechanism in MIRI. Three days after the injection of virus or saline into the myocardium, Sprague-Dawley\u00a0(SD) rats were subjected to 30\u00a0min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 6\u00a0h of reperfusion. Myocardial specimens were prepared for analysis. We performed immunohistochemichal and histopathological analysis, the measurement of cardiac biomarkers, TUNEL assay , RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The results indicated that the overexpression of RP105 contributed to an amelioration of myocardial histological damage, decreased leakage of creatine kinase\u00a0(CK) and lactate dehydrogenase\u00a0(LDH), as well as a reduction in the number of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes. The levels of positively associated modulators of apoptosis and autophagy were also significantly downregulated by RP105, whereas Bcl-2, which plays an opposite role in inducing apoptosis and autophagy, was inversely upregulated. Furthermore, the overexpression of RP105 led to the repression of TLR4 activity and the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB/p65, as well as the reduced production of the cytokines interleukin\u00a06\u00a0(IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor\u00a0\u03b1\u00a0(TNF-\u03b1). Taken together, these data suggest that RP105 protects the myocardium against apoptosis and autophagy, and plays a cardioprotective role during I/R injury. This is most likely due to the inactivation of TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Thus, RP105 may represent an innovative therapeutic target for attenuating MIRI. ",

However, the biological function and underlying mechanism of MEG3 in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) remain unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated the functional importance of lncRNA MEG3 in proliferation and angiogenesis of VECs. MEG3 overexpression significantly suppressed the proliferation and in vitro angiogenesis in VECs, whereas knockdown of MEG3 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, we found that MEG3 exerts its function through negatively regulating miR-9 by acting as a microRNA sponge. Taken together, MEG3-miR-9 plays an important role in proliferation and angiogenesis in VECs.",

The initial 10 mitoses of zebrafish embryonic cleavages occur every\u223c30 minutes, and therefore provide a rapid assay to evaluate mitosis inhibitors including those targeting Plk1. To increase efficiency and specificity, we first performed a computational virtual screen of\u223c60000 compounds against the human Plk1 3-D structure docked to both its kinase and Polo box domain. 370 candidates with the top free-energy scores were subjected to zebrafish assay and 3 were shown to inhibit cell division. Compared to general screen for compounds inhibiting zebrafish embryonic cleavage, computation increased the efficiency by 11 folds. One of the 3 compounds, named I2, was further demonstrated to effectively inhibit multiple tumor cell proliferation in vitro and PC3 prostate cancer growth in Xenograft mouse model in vivo. Furthermore, I2 inhibited Plk1 enzyme activity in a dose dependent manner. The IC50 values of I2 in these assays are compatible to those of ON-01910, a Plk1 inhibitor currently in Phase III clinic trials. Our studies demonstrate that zebrafish assays coupled with computational screening significantly improves the efficiency of identifying specific regulators of biological targets. The PLK1 inhibitor I2, and its analogs, may have potential in cancer therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is an essential component of the Wnt signaling pathway and plays important roles in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. As GSK3 is abnormally upregulated in several diseases including type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer, it has been regarded as a potential drug target. During zebrafish development, inhibition of GSK3 leads to ectopic activation of the Wnt pathway, resulting in a headless embryo. Using this phenotype as an assay we screened a chemical library of 4000 compounds and identified one novel compound, 3F8, which specifically inhibits eye and forebrain formation in zebrafish embryos, resembling a typical Wnt overexpression phenotype. Cell reporter assays, chemical informatics analysis and in vitro kinase experiments revealed that 3F8 is a selective GSK3 inhibitor, which is more potent than SB216763, a commonly used GSK3 inhibitor. Based on the structure of 3F8, a new generation of compounds inhibiting GSK3 was synthesized and validated by biological assays. Together, 3F8 and its derivatives could be useful as new reagents and potential therapeutic candidates for GSK3 related diseases.",

        "abstract": "During the preclinical drug discovery process it remains a challenge to enable early elimination of candidate molecules that may have non-specific, off-target activities. Here, we use whole zebrafish embryo assays coupled with genetic analysis to address this issue. PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1) is one of the key regulators that control mitotic entry, spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis in the cell cycle. Since plk1 expression is abnormally up-regulated in several tumors, it is regarded as a good target for cancer therapy. A number of small-molecule inhibitors targeting PLK1 have been developed as reagents and anticancer drug candidates. It will be interesting to determine if these inhibitors indeed specifically target PLK1 in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the zebrafish and human genomes share high homology across all PLK family members. In particular, PLK1 has a nearly identical 3-D structure between zebrafish and human. We selected three published PLK1 inhibitors, LFM-A13, ON01910, and thiazole-carboxamide 10A in our assay. When added at 2-cell stage, all of these inhibitors prevented embryos from dividing and caused cells to fuse into one large cell. When added at the later stage during zygotic mRNA transcription program initiation, embryos survived for 3 days but showed different phenotypes for each compound. Embryos treated with LFM-A13 appeared relatively normal. Embryos treated with ON01910 failed to properly develop trunk and tail regions while the head structure was unaffected. Embryos treated with thiazole-carboxamide 10A had a shorter body axis and deformed head structure. To determine which inhibitor is more selectively targeting PLK1, we inhibited PLK1 activity using anti-sense morpholino. Comparative analysis indicated that thiazole-carboxamide 10A could faithfully phenocopy zebrafish embryos genetically deficient of plk1. These findings demonstrate that these three PLK1 inhibitors, although well established by in vitro studies, have different off-target activities in vivo, and that thiazole-carboxamide 10A appears most specific to PLK1. Our studies suggest that zebrafish should be generally useful as an efficient in vivo model to evaluate specificity of small molecules designed to regulate any conserved target proteins through comparative analysis of genetic phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Blood vessels normally maintain stereotyped lumen diameters and their stable structures are crucial for vascular function. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the maintenance of vessel diameters and the integrity of endothelial cells. We investigated this issue in zebrafish embryos by a chemical genetics approach. Small molecule libraries were screened using live Tg(kdrl:GRCFP)(zn1) transgenic embryos in which endothelial cells are specifically labeled with GFP. By analyzing the effects of compounds on the morphology and function of embryonic blood vessels after lumen formation, PP1, a putative Src kinase inhibitor, was identified as capable of specifically reducing vascular lumen size by interrupting endothelial-cell integrity. The inhibitory effect is not due to Src or general VEGF signaling inhibition because another Src inhibitor and Src morpholino as well as several VEGFR inhibitors failed to produce a similar phenotype. After profiling a panel of 22 representative mammalian kinases and surveying published data, we selected a few possible new candidates. Combinational analysis of these candidate kinase inhibitors established that PP1 induced endothelial collapse by inhibiting both the VEGFR2 and MAP kinase pathways. More importantly, combinatory use of two clinically approved drugs Dasatinib and Sunitinib produced the same phenotype. This is the first study to elucidate the pathways controlling maintenance of endothelial integrity using a chemical genetics approach, indicating that endothelial integrity is controlled by the combined action of the VEGFR2 and MAP kinase pathways. Our results also suggest the possible side effect of the combination of two anticancer drugs on the circulatory system.",

We started to investigate the biological functions of SNXs using the zebrafish model. In this study, we demonstrated that SNX7 was essential for embryonic liver development. Hepatoblasts were specified normally, and the proliferation of these cells was not affected when SNX7 was knocked down by gene-specific morpholinos; however, they underwent massive apoptosis during the early budding stage. SNX7 mainly regulated the survival of cells in the embryonic liver and did not affect the viability of cells in other endoderm-derived organs. We further demonstrated that down-regulation of SNX7 by short interfering RNAs induced apoptosis in cell culture. At the molecular level, the cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP)/caspase 8 pathway was activated when SNX7 was down-regulated. Furthermore, overexpression of c-FLIP(S) was able to rescue the SNX7 knockdown-induced liver defect.SNX7 is a liver-enriched antiapoptotic protein that is indispensable for the survival of hepatoblasts during zebrafish early embryogenesis.",

The DNA biosensor, which is locked by GO, is designed to contain two sensing modules that include recognition site for ATP and self-replication track that yields the nicking domain for Nt.BbvCI. By taking advantage of the different binding affinity of single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA and aptamer-target complex toward GO, the DNA biosensor could be efficiently released from GO in the presence of target with the help of a complementary DNA strand (CPDNA) that partially hybridizes to the DNA biosensor. Then, the polymerization/nicking enzyme synergetic isothermal amplification could be triggered, leading to the synthesis of massive DNA amplicons, thus achieving an enhanced sensitivity with a wide linear dynamic response range of four orders of magnitude and good selectivity. This biosensing strategy expands the applications of GO-DNA nanobiointerfaces in biological sensing, showing great potential in fundamental research and biomedical diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "The type II CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used widely for genome editing in zebrafish. However, the requirement for the 59-NGG-39 protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) of Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) limits its targeting sequences. Here, we report that a Cas9 ortholog from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9), and its KKH variant, successfully induced targeted mutagenesis with high frequency in zebrafish. Confirming previous findings, the SpCas9 variant, VQR, can also induce targeted mutations in zebrafish. Bioinformatics analysis of these new Cas targets suggests that the number of available target sites in the zebrafish genome can be greatly expanded. Collectively, the expanded target repertoire of Cas9 in zebrafish should further facilitate the utility of this organism for genetic studies of vertebrate biology.",

        "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is an important biological process for proper cellular function and development. Defects leading to improper ribosome biogenesis can cause diseases such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia and Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome. Nucleolar proteins are a large family of proteins and are involved in many cellular processes, including the regulation of ribosome biogenesis. Through a forward genetic screen and positional cloning, we identified and characterized a zebrafish line carrying mutation in nucleolar protein with MIF4G domain 1 (nom1), which encodes a conserved nulceolar protein with a role in pre-rRNA processing. Zebrafish nom1 mutants exhibit major defects in endoderm development, especially in exocrine pancreas. Further studies revealed that impaired proliferation of ptf1a-expressing pancreatic progenitor cells mainly contributed to the phenotype. RNA-seq and molecular analysis showed that ribosome biogenesis and pre-mRNA splicing were both affected in the mutant embryos. Several defects of ribosome assembly have been shown to have a p53-dependent mechanism. In the nom1 mutant, loss of p53 did not rescue the pancreatic defect, suggesting a p53-independent role. Further studies indicate that protein phosphatase 1 alpha, an interacting protein to Nom1, could partially rescue the pancreatic defect in nom1 morphants if a human nucleolar localization signal sequence was artificially added. This suggests that targeting Pp1\u03b1 into the nucleolus by Nom1 is important for pancreatic proliferation. Altogether, our studies revealed a new mechanism involving Nom1 in controlling vertebrate exocrine pancreas formation.",

        "abstract": "The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitors have shown great promise in cancer therapeutics. SANT75, a novel compound we previously designed to specially inhibit the Smoothened (SMO) protein in the Hh pathway, has greater inhibitory potency than many of commonly used Hh inhibitors. However, preclinical studies of SANT75 revealed water insolubility and acute toxicity. To overcome these limitations, we developed a liposomal formulation of SANT75 and investigated its antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. We encapsulated SANT75 into PEGylated liposome and the mean particle size distribution and zeta-potential (ZP) of liposomes were optimized. Using the Shh-light2 cell and Gli-GFP or Flk-GFP transgenic reporter zebrafish, we confirmed that liposome-encapsulated SANT75 inhibited Hh activity with similar potency as the original SANT75. SANT75 encapsulated into liposome exerted strong tumor growth-inhibiting effects in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the liposomal SANT75 therapy efficiently improved the survival time of tumor-bearing mice without obvious systemic toxicity. The pathological morphology and immunohistochemistry staining revealed that liposomal SANT75 induced tumor cell apoptosis, inhibited tumor angiogenesis as assessed by CD31 and down-regulated the expression of Hh target protein Gli-1 in tumor tissues. Our findings suggest that liposomal formulated SANT75 has improved solubility and bioavailability and should be further developed as a drug candidate for treating tumors with abnormally high Hh activity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Although the genetic cause for Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) has been known for over 20 years, the mechanisms that cause the neurotoxicity and behavioral symptoms of this disease are not well understood. One hypothesis is that N-terminal fragments of the HTT protein are the causative agents in HD and that peptide sequences adjacent to the poly-glutamine (Q) repeats modify its toxicity. Here we test the function of the N-terminal 17 amino acids (N17) in the context of the exon 1 fragment of HTT in a novel, inducible zebrafish model of HD. Results Deletion of N17 coupled with 97Q expansion (mHTT-\u0394N17-exon1) resulted in a robust, rapidly progressing movement deficit, while fish with intact N17 and 97Q expansion (mHTT-exon1) have more delayed-onset movement deficits with slower progression. The level of mHTT-\u0394N17-exon1 protein was significantly higher than mHTT-exon1, although the mRNA level of each transgene was marginally different, suggesting that N17 may regulate HTT protein stability in vivo. In addition, cell lineage specific induction of the mHTT-\u0394N17-exon1 transgene in neurons was sufficient to recapitulate the consequences of ubiquitous transgene expression. Within neurons, accelerated nuclear accumulation of the toxic HTT fragment was observed in mHTT-\u0394N17-exon1 fish, demonstrating that N17 also plays an important role in sub-cellular localization in vivo. Conclusions We have developed a novel, inducible zebrafish model of HD. These animals exhibit a progressive movement deficit reminiscent of that seen in other animal models and human patients. Deletion of the N17 terminal amino acids of the huntingtin fragment results in an accelerated HD-like phenotype that may be due to enhanced protein stability and nuclear accumulation of HTT. These transgenic lines will provide a valuable new tool to study mechanisms of HD at the behavioral, cellular, and molecular levels. Future experiments will be focused on identifying genetic modifiers, mechanisms and therapeutics that alleviate polyQ aggregation in the nucleus of neurons.",

        "abstract": "The seven-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) is an essential component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway that is critically involved in normal animal development as well as pathological malignancies. In studying Hh-related biological processes, it would be highly desirable if Smo activity could be instantly switched between activation and inhibition. Using Gli1-dependent GFP transgenic zebrafish and in vitro biochemical assays, we identified and characterized two potent Smo inhibitors, SANT74 and 75 (Smoothened antagonist 74 and 75), by screening a small molecule library designed based on the scaffold of Smo agonist SAG. These compounds are structural analogs of SAG with the methyl group substituted by a propyl or allyl group in SANTs. We show that SANTs and SAG exert opposite effects on Smo activity by regulating protein conformation. Our study represents the first demonstration of conformational regulation of Smo by small molecule analogs, and the combinational use of these Smo modulators in a temporal controlled fashion should be useful for studying Hh biology.",

        "abstract": "The primary pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease (PD) is the profound loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. To facilitate the understanding of the underling mechanism of PD, several zebrafish PD models have been generated to recapitulate the characteristics of dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss. In zebrafish studies, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) has been frequently used as a molecular marker of DA neurons. However, th1 also labels norepinephrine and epinephrine neurons. Recently, a homologue of th1, named tyrosine hydroxylase 2 (th2), was identified based on the sequence homology and subsequently used as a novel marker of DA neurons. In this study, we present evidence that th2 co-localizes with serotonin in the ventral diencephalon and caudal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos. In addition, knockdown of th2 reduces the level of serotonin in the corresponding th2-positive neurons. This phenotype can be rescued by both zebrafish th2 and mouse tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) mRNA as well as by 5-hydroxytryptophan, the product of tryptophan hydroxylase. Moreover, the purified Th2 protein has tryptophan hydroxylase activity comparable with that of the mouse TPH1 protein in vitro. Based on these in vivo and in vitro results, we conclude that th2 is a gene encoding for tryptophan hydroxylase and should be used as a marker gene of serotonergic neurons.",

        "abstract": "Natural products are a rich resource for the discovery of therapeutic substances. By directly using 504 fine fractions from isolated traditional Chinese medicine plants, we performed a transgenic zebrafish based screen for anti-angiogenesis substances. One fraction, DYVE-D3, was found to inhibit the growth of intersegmental vessels in the zebrafish vasculature. Bioassay-guided isolation of DYVE-D3 indicates that the flavonoid kaempferol was the active substance. Kaempferol also inhibited the proliferation and migration of HUVECs in vitro. Furthermore, we found that kaempferol suppressed angiogenesis through inhibiting VEGFR2 expression, which can be enhanced by FGF inhibition. In summary, this study shows that the construction of fine fraction libraries allows efficient identification of active substances from natural products.",

        "abstract": "Sorting nexins (SNXs) are phosphoinositide-binding proteins implicated in the sorting of various membrane proteins in vitro, but the in vivo functions of them remain largely unknown. We reported previously that SNX10 is a unique member of the SNX family genes in that it has vacuolation activity in cells. We investigate the biological function of SNX10 by loss-of-function assay in this study and demonstrate that SNX10 is required for the formation of primary cilia in cultured cells. In zebrafish, SNX10 is involved in ciliogenesis in the Kupffer's vesicle and essential for left-right patterning of visceral organs. Mechanistically, SNX10 interacts with V-ATPase complex and targets it to the centrosome where ciliogenesis is initiated. Like SNX10, V-ATPase regulates ciliogenesis in vitro and in vivo and does so synergistically with SNX10. We further discover that SNX10 and V-ATPase regulate the ciliary trafficking of Rab8a, which is a critical regulator of ciliary membrane extension. These results identify an SNX10/V-ATPase-regulated vesicular trafficking pathway that is crucial for ciliogenesis, and reveal that SNX10/V-ATPase, through the regulation of cilia formation in various organs, play an essential role during early embryonic development.",

Through studies of model organisms, the genetic regulatory network of melanocyte development during embryogenesis has been well established. This network also seems to be shared with adult melanocyte regeneration and melanoma formation. To identify chemical regulators of melanocyte development and homeostasis, we screened a small-molecule library of 6000 compounds using zebrafish embryos and identified five novel compounds that inhibited pigmentation. Here we report characterization of two compounds, 12G9 and 36E9, which disrupted melanocyte development. TUNEL assay indicated that these two compounds induced apoptosis of melanocytes. Furthermore, compound 12G9 specifically inhibited the viability of mammalian melanoma cells in vitro. These two compounds should be useful as chemical biology tools to study melanocytes and could serve as drug candidates against melanocyte-related diseases.",

        "abstract": "[Objective]Using the Baiyu chewing cane collected from Guigang City, Guangxi as testing material, the main factors impacting Baiyu chewing cane in vitro culture was explored in order to establish the rapid regeneration propagation system. [Method]After using the tissues from Baiyu chewing cane\u2019s slightly-tailing leaves as explant callus for bud differentiation culture of callus, adventitious bud proliferation, and plantlet browning prevention and rooting induction were conducted using different culture medium and hormone combinations. [Result]Baiyu chewing cane leaf slicing for callus induction was a convenient and effective method. After the whorl sections were connected with the culture medium (MS+2,4-D 3 mg/L, agar 5 g/L, sugar 30 g/L) for 30 d, explants rapidly expanded, the edges became granular, light yellow or yellow, and the embryogenic callus or paste callus displayed uniformed quality. The optimum culture medium for buds differentiation induction in Baiyu chewing cane was MS+6-BA 1.0 mg/L+ NAA0.2 mg/L. For the proliferation of adventitious buds, the optimum effect resulted from the MS+6-BA 3.0 mg/L+KT 0.5 mg/L+NAA 0.6 mg/L+ sugar 30.0 g/L treatment. To prevent browning effects, the PVP and activated carbon tissue culture seedlings had different effects; the 1% activated carbon could effectively inhibit the proliferation of adventitious shoots browning in Baiyu chewing cane culture medium. In the rooting culturing process, the optimal culturing medium was MS+ NAA 0.6 mg/L+ sugar 50.0 g/L + activated carbon 0.1%. [Conclusion]By the orthogonal design test, the regeneration system of Baiyu chewing cane breeding was established in order to speed up the breeding rate of Baiyu chewing cane, improve propagation coefficient, and provide an effective way for capital-saving.",

        "abstract": "In this study,the virus-free sugarcane seedlings produced by a new tissue culture way\u2014the temporary immersion bioreactors system( TIBs) and the traditional tissue culture mode were used as experimental materials,and several physiological and biochemical indicators were analyzed in them during the rapid propagation period,root period and refined seedling stage respectively. Results showed the plant-type of viru-free seedling of TIBs were higher than CK in plant height,stem diameter,leaf number,leaf length,leaf width,and etc. The water content were not different between them. The chlorophyll contents,proline contents,soluble sugar contents,soluble protein contents and peroxidase activities were not different in propagation period,but higher than CK in root period and refine seedling stage. It is thus suggested that TIBs can produce stronger sugarcane seedlings that have a wider tolerance to stresses as compared to the traditional tissue culture mode.",

Currently, the combination and concentrations of various plant growth regulators, the composition of culture medium and generation of phenolic compounds in culture media during the culture are the main issues which are still remained to be optimized under different conditions. Researches showed that alkalinity and compounds such as malachite green, 2,4-D, thiouracil and TS preparation could enhance the efficiency of virus-free cultures in many crops. However, the use of these chemicals have not been fully exploited in sugarcane meristematic tip tissue culture. The optimization of some advanced tissue culture technologies such as temporary immersion bioreactor system, plant sugar-free tissue culture and rapid propagation technology has been discussed and use of novel technologies and modern equipments to enhance the production efficiency and reduce the production cost in tissue culture of sugarcane has been suggested.",

One common task is to separate such data into appropriate single components for further analysis. In this paper, we consider data separation from fewer, linear, nonadaptive, and noisy measurements. We show that the distinct subcomponents, which are (approximately) sparse in morphologically different (redundant) dictionaries, can be reconstructed by solving the split-analysis algorithm, provided that the dictionaries satisfy a mutual coherence (between the different dictionaries) condition and the measurement matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property adapted to a composed dictionary. These conditions impose no incoherence restriction on the dictionaries themselves, and our main result may be the first of this kind.",

Refinable functions with exponential decay also play an important role in the study of Riesz bases of wavelets generated from multiresolution analysis. A fundamental problem is whether the standard solution of a refinement equation with an exponentially decaying mask has exponential decay. We investigate this fundamental problem by considering cascade algorithms in weighted Lp spaces (1\u2264p\u2264\u221e). We give some sufficient conditions for the cascade algorithm associated with an exponentially decaying mask to converge in weighted Lp spaces. Consequently, we prove that the refinable functions associated with the Butterworth filters are continuous functions with exponential decay. By analyzing spectral properties of the transition operator associated with an exponentially decaying mask, we find a characterization for the corresponding refinable function to lie in weighted L2 spaces. The general theory is applied to an interesting example of bivariate refinable functions with exponential decay, which can be viewed as an extension of the Butterworth filters. \u00a9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses reconstruction of a signal from undersampled data in the situation that the signal is sparse or approximately sparse in terms of a (possibly) highly overcomplete and coherent tight frame $D$ via the $l_{1}$-analysis optimization problem. Some new sufficient conditions on the $D$ -restricted isometry property are given to guarantee stable recovery of signals which are nearly sparse in terms of $D$, from undersampled data with minimal $l_{1}$-norm of transform coefficients. One of the main results of this paper shows that if the $D$-restricted isometry constant $\\\\delta_{s}$ of the measurement matrix $A$ satisfies $\\\\delta_{s}<0.307$ , then signals which are approximately $s$-sparse in terms of $D$ are guaranteed to be stably recovered via the $l_{1}$-analysis optimization problem. We point out that with the lemmas and the proof techniques developed in this paper, most of the sufficient conditions on the standard restricted isometry property for stable recovery of nearly sparse signals via standard $l_{1}$ -minimization, can be similarly extended to the general case of the $D$-restricted isometry property for stable recovery of signals that are nearly sparse in terms of $D$ via the $l_{1}$-analysis optimization problem, yielding weaker conditions than previously available in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Quantitative proteomics technologies have been developed to comprehensively identify and quantify proteins in two or more complex samples. Quantitative proteomics based on differential stable isotope labeling is one of the proteomics quantification technologies. Mass spectrometric data generated for peptide quantification are often noisy, and peak detection and definition require various smoothing filters to remove noise in order to achieve accurate peptide quantification. Many traditional smoothing filters, such as the moving average filter, Savitzky-Golay filter and Gaussian filter, have been used to reduce noise in MS peaks. However, limitations of these filtering approaches often result in inaccurate peptide quantification. Here we present the WaveletQuant program, based on wavelet theory, for better or alternative MS-based proteomic quantification.We developed a novel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and a 'Spatial Adaptive Algorithm' to remove noise and to identify true peaks. We programmed and compiled WaveletQuant using Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition. We then incorporated the WaveletQuant program in the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP), a commonly used open source proteomics analysis pipeline.We showed that WaveletQuant was able to quantify more proteins and to quantify them more accurately than the ASAPRatio, a program that performs quantification in the TPP pipeline, first using known mixed ratios of yeast extracts and then using a data set from ovarian cancer cell lysates. The program and its documentation can be downloaded from our website at http://systemsbiozju.org/data/WaveletQuant.",

Cand\u00e8s has proven that \u03b42 k<2-1\u22480.4142 is a sufficient condition for the l1 minimization problem having a k-sparse solution. Later, S. Foucart and M. Lai have improved the condition to \u03b42k<0.4531 and S. Foucart has improved the bound to \u03b42k<0.4652. In 2010, T. Cai, L. Wang and G. Xu have improved the condition to \u03b42k<0.4721 for the cases such that k is a multiple of 4 or k is very large and S. Foucart has improved the bound to \u03b42k<0.4734 for large values of k. In this paper, we have improved the sufficient condition to \u03b42 k<0.4931 for general k. Also, in some special cases, the sufficient condition can be improved to \u03b42k<0.6569. These new bounds have several benefits on recovering compressible signals with noise. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Cascade algorithm is an important issue to wavelets analysis and computer graphics. Main results of this paper are related to the convergence and convergence rates of vector cascade algorithm in (Lp(Rs))r (1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e). We give some characterizations on convergence of cascade algorithm and also give estimates on convergence rates of this cascade algorithm with M being isotropic dilation matrix. It is well known that smoothness is a very important property of a multiple refinable function. A characterization of Lp(1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e) smoothness of multiple refinable functions is also presented when M = qIs \u00d7 s, where Is\u00d7s is the s\u00d7s identity matrix, and q \u2265 2 is an integer.

The almost identical ultralow bulk and shear moduli of approximately 24 GPa combined with an ultrahigh strength of approximately 0.9 GPa contribute to easy crystal distortion due to much-weakened chemical bonding of atoms in the crystal, leading to significant elastic softening in tension and elastic hardening in compression.

        "abstract": "In this paper,we have made a proposal to use rapeseed meal(RM) to adsorb Cr(VI) from the simulated sewage,while exploring with it the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of the adsorption for Cr(\u2165).At the same time,we have also made a detailed investigation of the effects of pH value,adsorbent dosage,temperature,initial concentration and contact time on the adsorption process.As a result,all the experimental data of equilibrium isothermal under different temperatures prove to be well fit with Langmuir and Freundlich models.And then,the pseudo-second-order equation was adopted to the analysis of the kinetic data to prove the results in accord with the data demanded for the calculation.To understand the interaction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent,we have used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR) to verify the actual difference of RM involved before and after the adsorption was done.The results demonstrate that the uptake of Cr(\u2165) was highly pH dependent and significantly increased correlated with decrease of pH value.It was found that the RM exhibit strong adsorption behaviors for Cr(\u2165),with the percentage removal of Cr(VI) being over 90% under the conditions when the initial chromium concentration was 50 mg/g,the RM dosage was 2 g/L,with the solution pH value of 1.2 and for 3 hours.The data of equilibrium adsorption can well be properly described by using Langmuir and Freunlich adsorption isotherm models.More precisely speaking,the equilibrium constants KL and KF for two models respectively tend to increase with the rise of temperature,which indicate that the higher temperature,the more it is beneficial for enhancing the absorptive capacity of RM for Cr(\u2165).We have also found that the maximum adsorption capacity(qm) of Cr(VI) was 54.6 mg/g at 313 K.The kinetic data have also been proven well fitted with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model,with the correlation coefficient gained by the model being up to 0.999 6.And the calculated equilibrium uptakes of Cr(\u2165) by the kinetic model prove to be well consistent with the experimental data.Thus,the experimental results of FTIR prove well to account for the interaction as what has happened between the Cr(VI) and the functional groups of \u2014OH,\u2014CO\u2014,\u2014CN on the surface of RM.",

The effect of pretreatment methods on the test results was investigated. The results indicated that the determination results of metal elements by pretreating sample with ashing method were higher than those with acid leaching method, except that the result of Zn was low. Among these solutions, the mixture acid with oxidant, like HCl + HF + H2O2 was more efficient to dissolve the metals than HCl, HNO3, HCl + HF and HCl + HNO3, and thus are the most suitable for the leaching of the metals in the carbon materials. The established method was applied to determine the content of Fe, Na, Zn, Ca, Mg, K, Cu in one microporous carbon molecular sieve sample and its eluent. 91.0%-120% and 97%-110% of average recoveries and 0.8%-5.6% and 1.5%-4.3% of RSDs were obtained, respectively. The experimental results also showed that it should be a feasible method for the analysis of distribution and speciation of metal elements on the surface of porous carbon materials by ICP-AES assisted with selective elution of surface metals with various solutions.",

        "abstract": "The received waveform model for different earth surfaces is significant for altimeter system design,and the model of ocean surface is rarely researched after Tsai.According to the theory of Fresnel diffraction,the character of specular reflection and statistical regularity of the ocean surface profile,the analytic expression of detector output and the average received photons are deduced which are used for ocean altimeter and different from the results of Tsai under the condition of near-normal incidence.The simulated waveform is established for laser altimeter with microradian beam divergence and compared with the real geoscience laser altimeter system(GLAS) received signal.The energy,root mean square(RMS) width,amplitude and shape are very similar and the errors between simulated and real waveforms are all less than 6%.The parameters of received signal are related to the altimeter systems and the wind speed over the ocean surface,and taking the GLAS parameters for example,the valid ocean waveforms can be hardly got when the wind speed exceeds 12 m/s.The analysis and conclusion are important theory basis for the design of laser altimeter system and the wind speed calculation over the ocean surface.",

The hydrostatic delay is the major component of total zenith delay, which is only decided by surface pressure. The hydrostatic equation of static atmosphere was deduced under the condition of non-ideal gas, and surface pressure model was established relevant to geopotential height. Combined with the meteorological data of NCEP and position and elevation data of GLAS, the surface pressure was calculated by numerical integration of 4 order Runge-Kutta algorithm, and then the hydrostatic delay was obtained. Through the respective comparisons between the hydrostatic delays got by this method and the NCEP estimated surface pressure with the GLAS official results, the trend and accuracy of this method are both better with the maximum error less than 2cm. It is concluded that the hydrostatic delay of satellite laser altimeter can be corrected effectively and accurately by the method based on hydrostatic equation and numerical integration.",

It was absolutely crucial for retrieving the height and category of target by extracting the statistical parameters of non-Gaussian waveforms. Based on the feature of received pulse signal, its mathematics model was described with generalized Gaussian function. Using the method of smoothing filtering and calculating initial parameters on received waveforms, and the non-linear least squares algorithm, an analyzer with extracting the statistical parameters for received waveforms was developed. In terms of the analyzer, simulated waveforms processing and statistical parameters extraction were performed well. The analyzed results show that the maximal extraction error for statistical parameters is less than 1% for the single generalized Gaussian waveforms with 15 dB signal to noise ratio (SNR). Meanwhile, with the increase of the number of generalized Gaussian components and the decrease of SNR, extraction error for statistical parameters becomes larger. The statistical parameters can be extracted effectively with waveforms analyzer, which provides data gist for retrieving the target information.",

According to the operational principle of SLA, the theoretical models of received signal and receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are established, and the mathematical expressions about range error, probability of detection and false alarm are deduced. Under the condition that probability of detection and false alarm can satisfy the threshold, an optimizational design method for RFB on the basis of minimizing the range error is put forward. As an example of MOLA-2, the distributions of RFB and range error related with different target slope angles are simulated. The results show that the optimizational design values of RFB are larger than values given by conventional method within 40\u00b0 target slope angle, whose difference limits the scope from 0.7 MHz to 58.7 MHz. However, corresponding range errors are less than them obtained by conventional method, the extent of their difference is 0.2~16.2 m. With the restrictions of target variety and complexity, it is difficult to make every target correspond with a receiver filter during its manufacture, so multiple receiver filter channels are set up to piecewise fit the distribution curve of range errors, the RFB and corresponding scope of target slope angle for each channel are achieved. The optimizational method of designing the RFB provides a superior and practicable scheme for manufacturing receiver filter.",

To extract the center of line-structured light with a length of 2 meter in a large field of view and strong noise background,an exaction method based on region of interest (ROI) is proposed. Firstly,ROI for image processing is defined by using statistic method,then Otsu method is used for threshold segmentation and barycenter method is used to exact the center within ROI. Experiments showed that the extracting time of a 1280\u00d71024 sized picture of a line-structured light was about 47ms in Visual C ++6.0 by the proposed method and the extraction was proved accurate. The proposed method reduces the interference of strong background noise in large field of view and improves the extraction speed of line-structured light.",

A new method is derived to retrieve the wind speed by the path of waveform width\u2014root mean square (RMS) surface height\u2014wind speed, which differs from the classical path of received energy\u2014mean sea slope\u2014wind speed. First, by deriving a more rigorous expression of the waveform model of an ocean surface for a laser altimeter, the theoretical relationship between the surface height RMS and waveform width is established. Second, the surface height RMS is fitted to a new empirical formula that is related to the wind speed using the geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS) waveform data and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction wind speeds. Then, the JONSWAP spectra with swell effect and the waveform simulator are used to generate sea surface profiles and echo waveforms to verify the new ...",

In this paper, a rate prediction model is proposed for image compression methods based on Lapped Biorthogonal Transform (LBT), such as JPEG XR coding standard. The 3-D mapping relationship among the quantization parameter, the image activity, and the coding rate is constructed. Then the coding rate could be estimated by the image activity. In addition, the quantization parameter could also be used for predicting the compression quality (measured by PSNR). Experimental results show that the relative average error of the predicted code rate is 0.03b/p, which can meet the demand of most common applications. The algorithm is simple and the memory consumption is also low. Therefore, it is valuable for image compression methods based on LBT.",

        "abstract": "Current land-cover classification methods using ICESat/GLAS's (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) datasets are based on empirical thresholds or machine learning by training multiple GLAS parameters, e.g., the reflectivity and elevation of the target and width, amplitude, kurtosis, and skewness of the return waveform. A theoretical classifier is derived based on a waveform model of an actual laser altimeter illuminating the sea surface. With given system parameters and the sea surface wind corresponding to the location of a laser footprint (the wind can be calculated by using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction dataset), a precise theoretical waveform can be generated as a reference. Compared with the measured waveform, a weighted total difference, which is very sensitive to small-scale sea ice within the laser footprint, can be calculated to classify the GLAS measured data as open water. In the north of Greenland, after discarding the saturated GLAS data, the new theoretical classifier performed better [overall accuracy ()=95.62%, Kappa coefficient=0.8959] compared to the classical support vector machine (SVM) classifier (=90.44%, Kappa=0.7901), but the SVM classifier showed a better result for the user's accuracy of sea ice. Benefiting from the synergies of the theoretical and SVM classifiers, the integrated theoretical and SVM classifier achieved excellent accuracy (=98.21%, Kappa=0.9588). In the future, the new ICESat-2 photon counting laser altimeter will also construct a \"waveform\" (elevation distribution) by selecting the photon cloud, and thus, this new analytical method will be potentially useful for detecting open water in the Arctic.",

        "abstract": "Ranging performance is the key indicator for a ranging lidar system, and a theoretical ranging performance model can be used for optimizing systematic parameters when designing a lidar system. The fluctuation of the signal photon numbers introduces range walk error to photon-counting lidars that can be as high as tens of centimeters. In this paper, based on the lidar equation and the statistical property of photon-counting detectors, a theoretical ranging performance model for photon-counting lidars with multiple detectors is first derived. Next, a theoretical correction method for offsetting range walk error is proposed, as verified by experiments using a Gm-APD (Geiger mode avalanche photodiode) lidar system. The results indicate that multiple detectors are very useful to maintain a consistent ranging precision when the mean received signal photons are variable. With a 1600 repetitive ranging measurement, the new method can achieve a centimeter ranging accuracy, with a mean and standard deviation of the residual errors of 1.14 cm and 1.23 cm, respectively. This new method is potentially suitable for a satellite photon-counting lidar system such as ICESat-2, as only a certain number of repetitive measurements, the time tag, and a certain number of triggered detectors are required to offset the range walk error.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the data accuracy of a satellite laser altimeter, in situ verification should be performed periodically, and the laser footprint center should be precisely extracted and positioned. To date, two methods have been derived to determine the center of the laser footprint: using waveform matching when a laser is illuminated on complex surfaces or using an energy detector array to capture the laser footprint when illuminating a flat calibration site. A corner cube retroreflector (CCR) array is never used to calculate the footprint center. In this study, a new method is derived to determine the laser center by analyzing the return waveforms, which are marked with a designed CCR array above ground. First, the parameters of a single CCR are designed to compensate for the velocity aberration of a satellite. The footprint center is positioned based on a damped steepest decent method when at least four CCRs are hit, and the corresponding return waveforms are marked. Next, the layout scheme of the CCRs is designed, and the positioning accuracy is evaluated using this new method. The simulated results indicate that the positioning accuracy of the laser footprint centers will be approximately 2\u00a0m horizontal. In the future, this method will be used to determine laser footprint centers and will be integrated with the current method of energy detector array in the calibration site to provide basic data to accomplish in situ verification work for the China GF-7 satellite laser altimeter.",

        "abstract": "With much smaller footprints (approximately a few tens of meters), the data of a laser altimeter are promising for obtaining the sea level near offshore areas, where radar altimeters with larger footprints cannot operate. However, the current ocean surface detection methods for a photon-counting lidar cannot effectively eliminate the noise photons when measuring the sea surface, thereby introducing a ranging bias. In this paper, a new ocean surface detection method is derived based on the JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) wave spectrum and LM (Levenberg-Marquardt) nonlinear least-squares fitting. Using the data photons that are captured by the NASA MABEL (Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar) photon-counting lidar, the new method is tested and compared to the MABEL standard result. The new method achieved better profile detection of sea surfaces and successfully discarded the noise photons in a sub-layer below the sea surface from the MABEL standard result. By reconstructing the \"accumulated waveform\", we found that the noise photons in the sub-layer produce small tails after the main waveform, which introduces an overestimated ranging bias of 9 cm. This difference of 9 cm is similar to the sea level bias of 10 cm that was obtained from the ICESat/GLAS laser altimeter data and the TOPEX/Poseidon radar altimeter data in an earlier study, which limited the use of laser altimeter data. According to the analysis in this paper, we can partially interpret what occurred for the ICESat/GLAS waveform tails when ICESat was measuring sea surfaces. The newly derived method can protect the MABEL and incoming ICESat-2 data photons from noise photon interference and ranging bias when measuring the sea surface.",

        "abstract": "Optical elements and devices based on metallic metasurface, with periodic micronano structures sitting on a substrate, have advantages such as ultra-thinness, broadband response and large extending angles. However, the relatively low efficiency is still a big problem and would hold back their practical applications. Though high performance metasurface devices such as hologram with 80% optical efficiency have been reported recently [1], the intrinsic ohmic losses cannot be avoided still now. In this paper, we present that silicon nanobrick arrays (a typical dielectric metasurface), with their anisotropic nano-structures, is sensitive to the polarisation of an incident beam and can be used to form high performance elements and devices. With careful design of such structures in the fiber telecommunications windows (1460nm \u223c 1625 nm), magnetic resonance occurs along the long axis direction and light with polarization aligned with this direction would be almost totally reflected (\u223c 98.5%), whilst that along the short axis is nearly totally transmitted (\u223c 94.3%). That implies that a novel polarising beam splitter (PBS) can be formed with silicon nanobrick arrays. The silicon nanobrick-based PBS can find applications in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) since an ultra-compact PBS is always required to be integrated into a multifunctional optoelectronic device.",

The return pulse reflected from ground surface is gathered by the receiver of space laser altimeter, the pulsewidth and amplitude of which are changeable with the variability of the ground relief. Meantime, several kinds of noise overlapped on the return pulse signal affect its signal-to-noise ratio. To eliminate the influence of these factors that cause range walk and range uncertainty, the reliable laser ranging methods need to be implemented to obtain high-precision range results.

        "abstract": "For photon-counting lidars, the current ranging performance models are based on Poisson statistics that are a special case of a negative-binomial (NB) distribution. In this paper, a new ranging performance model that considers the effect of a target's speckle, the noise, and the dead-time of photon-counting detectors is derived from the NB distribution. The derived ranging performance model is verified by both an experiment based on a Geiger mode avalanche photodiode (GM-APD) lidar and a simulation using the recursive method. The ranging performance model is then used to analyze the effect of target speckle for two typical photon-counting ranging systems aimed at different types of target: the space-borne Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) for detecting the Earth's surface, and the ground-based laser ranging system at Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) station for detecting space debris. The results indicate that for space-borne or airborne lidar, the ranging performance model can be approximated to the classic models based on Poisson statistics, but for a ground-based laser ranging system, the approximation model introduces differences of ~1 cm in ranging bias and 4.8 cm in ranging precision from the theoretical model of the NB distribution. In addition, the new model is universal because it is compatible with the classic model of a Poisson distribution, i.e., when the speckle diversity is greater than 100, the result calculated from the new model is identical to the classic model.",

        "abstract": "To study the relationship between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and left ventricular mass (LVM) in newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).Seventy-two newborns admitted to the NICU were enrolled. ACE genotypes were determined by genomic DNA which was isolated from heel-prick blood. Disease status of the newborns was evaluated by the Neonatal Critical Score (draft) on postnatal day 1. LVM and LVM index (LVMI) were evaluated by echocardiography on postnatal days 1-3.DD genotype was identified in 11 cases, ID genotype in 31 cases, and II genotype in 30 cases. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics, critical score and body measurements in newborns with different genotypes. The DD genotype group showed significantly lower LVMI than the group with ID+II genotypes (29\u00b14 g/m2 vs 35\u00b18 g/m2; P<0.05).ACE gene polymorphism is associated with the LVMI in newborns admitted to the NICU. The LVMI of DD genotype carriers is significantly lower than that of ID+II genotypes carriers, which suggests that D allele may be associated with the growth and development of left ventricular.",

Methods In this retrospective study, we analyzed the data of all premature infants hospitalized in our newborn ward from January 1994 to December 2002. Results The incidence of feeding intolerance was 28.3%, and this increased in low birth weight and small gestational age infants. The incidence was 69.2% in very low birth weight infants (VLBWI). The symptoms of feeding intolerance, such as gastric residual, vomiting and abdominal distension presented usually in the first week of enteral feeding. The premature infants with smaller gestational age and lower birth weight often presented with gastric residual and abdominal distension, but the larger ones with vomiting. Conclusions We should pay more attention to gastric residual, vomiting and abdominal distension of premature infants, especially, in the first week of enteral feeding in VLBWI.",

Methods Medical records of 1378 hospitalized preterm infants from January 1994 to December 2005 were reviewed by being divided into two groups, 1994~1999(1st 6 years) group and 2000~2005(2nd 6 years). Results The statistics showed that there was an increased tendency of low gestational age and low birth weight preterm infants in end 6 years. The percentage of 28~30 weeks babies was 6.7% vs. 13.6%, \u03c7 2=15.032, P<0.001; the percentage of birth weight less than 1500g was 11.3% vs. 14.9%, \u03c7 2=3.558, P=0.059. Seventy-four babies died. The mortality rate was 5.4% and it declined in end 6 years, 8.5% vs. 3.6%, \u03c7 2=14.981,P<0.001. The morbidity of wet lung(2.8% vs. 5.2%), acidosis(1% vs. 3.7%), swallowing syndrome(3.0% vs. 4.5%)and hypoglycemia(10.5% vs. 14.2%)increased with years, but morbidity of pneumonia(18.9% vs. 10.8%), scleredema(4.5% vs. 1.1%), pulmonary hemorrhage(4.9% vs. 1.8%)and hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy (4.5% vs. 2.3%)declined. Conclusions Although there are improvement in the mortality and morbidity of some complications in preterm infants, the percentage of low gestational age and low birth weight preterm infants increases year by year.

Each category was sub-classified, according to single or compound defect, as isolated external defects (including those with NTD only) or multiple external defects (including those with NTD and another major external birth defects that is not the sequence of a defect such as cleft lip with or without cleft palate). The rates of anencephalus, encephalocele, high- and low-level spina bifida (SB) in males and females and their sex ratios were calculated, adjusted for urban and rural areas, season, category and birth outcome by sex and sites of lesions (high vs. low).Totally, 784 NTD cases were identified from 326 874 recorded births (including live births, stillbirths and fetal deaths with a gestation age of at least 20 weeks). The prevalence rates of anencephalus (1.30 per 1 000 female births) and high-level SB (3.99) in females were higher than those (0.66 and 1.66 per 1 000 male births) in males in the high-prevalence northern regions; with adjusted prevalence rates of females 1.8 - 2.1 times greater than those of males. In the low-prevalence southern regions, the prevalence of high- (0.32 per 1 000 female births) and low-level SB (0.21) in female were higher than those in males, with high- and low-level SB rate of 0.10 and 0.09 per 1 000 male births), with adjusted rates for females of 1.3 - 1.6 times higher than in males. Isolated NTD accounted for more than 80% of all NTD cases, and the prevalence of isolated NTD in females (2.57) was higher than that in males (1.40).The sex differences in NTD existed between north and south, in accordance with the phenotype of NTD. It suggested that proportion of high level SB and anencephalus in females could increase as the prevalence of NTD going up, anencephaly, high- and low-level SB had the different genetic and environmental background.",

        "abstract": "To understand the current status and its changing patterns of perinatal health care in some southern and northern areas of China from 1994 to 2000.Data was collected in 13 counties/cities covered by Perinatal Health Care Surveillance System which was part of the Sino-American cooperative project on neural tube defects prevention, established in 1992. The study population consisted of 368 589 women who delivered single live births of at least 20 gestational weeks from 1994 through 2000. Chi-square test was employed to test the difference on the proportions of women with prenatal checkup, women with early prenatal care onset, women with at least five prenatal visits, hospital delivery versus home delivery as well as the proportion of women with at least three postpartum visits. Two-way ANOVA was used to test the differences of mean of gestational weeks at first prenatal visit and the mean of prenatal visits between different year and areas.The proportion of women with prenatal checkup remained over 99.0% from 1994 through 2000. The mean of gestational weeks at first prenatal visit changed from 13.1 weeks in 1994 to 10.7 weeks in 2000. The proportions of women with early prenatal care onset increased from 65.5% in 1994 to 79.4% in 2000 while women with at least five prenatal visit increasing from 34.1% to 71.8%, hospital delivery increasing from 91.3% to 98.8%, home delivery decreasing from 5.6 % to 0. 6%, women with at least three postpartum visits increasing from 80.5 % to 95.1%. Except for the proportion of women with early prenatal care onset, other proportions in northern areas were lower than those in southern areas in the same year. Greater differences between urban and rural areas in northern areas were found than in southern areas.The utilization of perinatal health care services was greatly improved in both southern and northern areas from 1994 to 2000. However, there were still obvious differences in the perinatal health care services between northern and southern areas as well as between urban and rural areas in northern China.",

Methods Clinical records were reviewed for 151 preterm infants in our hospital in 2004. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed as hyponatremia during this period. Of these patients, eight cases were classified as hyponatremia of water excess and 16 of sodium losses. Hyponatremia occurred in the first postnatal week for all cases and 91. 7 % in the 3 days. Patients with hyponatremia of sodium losses were recovered quickly, but whose with the hyponatremia of water excess were recovered with extended period (P<0. 05). The hyponatremia of water excess was associated with asphyxia, mechanical ventilation and severe diseases. Conclusion Hyponatremia was most likely to occur in the neonatal period. Serum natremia monitoring is helpful for early diagnoses and treatment Attention should be paid to cases with hyponatremia of water excess, especially for preterm infants with asphyxia and mechanical ventilation, and those with severe diseases.",

The study population consisted of 83,030 women who attended premarital/preconception medical physical examination program and had delivered single live birth with at least 20 gestational weeks from 1995 to 2000 in Jiaxing area, Zhejiang province.from the Chi-square test were employed to test the differences in the rates of neonatal asphyxia between groups with different BMI and other characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression method was conducted to examine the association between pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, and the risk of asphyxia. Results The average rate of neonatal asphyxia was 11.3% (95% CI: 11.1%-11.6%). The rates of neonatal asphyxia among women with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2, 18.5-22.9 kg/m2, 23.0-24.9 kg/m2, and > or = 25.0 kg/m2 were 11.0% (95% CI: 10.5%-11.5%), 11.3% (95% CI: 11.1%- 11.6%), 11.8% (95% CI: 11.0%-12.6%), and 12.9% (95% CI: 11.6%-14.4%) respectively. The rates of neonatal asphyxia were 12.4% among women with weight gain < 0.3 kg/wk, higher than women with higher weight gain. After adjusting for residential area, maternal age, educational level, occupation, parity, times of prenatal visit, high-risk experiences during pregnancy, high-risk experiences at time of delivery, gestational week and birth weight, the estimated ORs were 1.03 (95% CI: 0.97-1.09), 1.06 (95% CI: 0.96-1.16) and 1.14 (95% CI: 1.00-1.31), respectively. These ORs became 1.02 (95% CI: 0.95-1.09), 1.01 (95% CI:0.90-1.13) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.92-1.28) after further adjusting the variable \"gestational weight gain\". The estimated ORs for neonatal asphyxia were 1.06 (95% CI: 1.01-1.12) for women with weight gain at 0.3-kg/wk and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02-1.20) for women with weight gain <0.3 kg/wk when compared to those with weight gain > or = 0.5 kg/wk.Lower weight gain seemed to have the effect of increasing the risk of neonatal asphyxia.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the relationship of disease severity with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and serum ACE activity in preterm infants during the first 7 days of life. Methods: ACE genotypes were determined in 85 preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Serum ACE activity was measured and disease severity was evaluated by the Neonatal Critical Score (draft) 1, 3 and 7 days after birth. Results: Of the 85 preterm infants, DD genotype was found in 19 cases, ID genotype in 34 cases and II genotype in 32 cases. On the 1st day of life, serum ACE activity in the DD genotype (33.42 \u00b1 7.93 U/L) and the ID genotype groups (31.53 \u00b1 7.56 U/L) were significantly higher than that in the II genotype group (25.53 \u00b1 7.56 U/L) (P<0.01). After 3 and 7 days of life, serum ACE activity decreased in the three groups, but the DD genotype group remained the highest ACE activity, followed by the ID genotype and the II genotype groups. On the 1st day of life, the critical score of the DD genotype group (87.37 \u00b1 8.30) was lower than the ID genotype (95.82 \u00b1 5.85) and the II genotype groups (95.88 \u00b1 6.85) (P<0.01). On the 3rd day, the critical score of the DD genotype group was still lower than the ID genotype group (92.95 \u00b1 7.10 vs 96.94 \u00b1 5.85) (P<0.05). Conclusions: ACE gene I/D polymorphism may be associated with the disease severity in preterm infants. The DD genotype carriers present more severe disease status, with higher serum ACE activity. Although the disease status can influence serum ACE activity, serum ACE activity is determined by the ACE genotype.",

These data were collected as part of the Sino-American cooperative project on NTDs prevention. We classified NTDs as anencephaly, encephalocele, high-level and low-level spina bifida (SB) according to location of the lesion (high vs low) and whether the defect was isolated or occurred in association with other birth defects. Rates were compared in the high-prevalence (North) region and the low-prevalence (South) region, after adjusted for classification, urban and rural, season and sex, and calculated the adjusted rate of NTDs.Among seven hundred and eighty-four NTDs cases in 326 874 recorded births (include in livebirth, stillbirth and fetal death with a gestational age of at least 20 weeks), the overall NTDs prevalence in the North was 5.57/1,000 births, and in the South was 0.88/1 000. There were also significant differences in the prevalence of anencephaly, encephalocele, high-level and low-level SB between North (0.97, 0.49, 2.75 and 1.11/1,000 birth) and South (0.36, 0.15, 0.21 and 0.14/1,000 birth) (P < 0.01), with adjusted prevalences in the North 3 - 7 times higher than those in the South. There were significant difference between urban (2.04) and rural areas (6.57/1,000 birth) in the North (P < 0.01), urban (0.52) and rural areas (0.95/1,000 birth) in the South (P < 0.05). Adjusted prevalence rates in the rural were 3 - 4 times higher than those of urban in the North and 1.6 - 1.9 times higher than in the South; The seasonal rate of high-level SB increased between September and November in the North (3.44/1,000 birth), while the seasonal rate of anencephaly decreased between September and November (0.18/1,000 birth) in the South. However there were no seasonal changes in other classified NTDs both in the South and North.The birth prevalence of NTDs in the North of China was the highest in the world. There were significant differences between the North and the South, urban and rural. There was seasonal change in high-level SB in the North, which was in accordance to the phenotype of NTDs. It was suggested that there might exist etiological heterogeneity among anecephalus, low- and high-level SB.",

The perinatal risk factors were analysed.Four hundred and eighty-four cases of CP were found among this population. The prevalence of CP for children aged 1 - 6 years old was 1.59 per thousand. The prevalence of CP were strongly correlated to prematurity (RR = 25.16), low birth weight (RR = 19.63), and also highly correlated to small for gestational age (RR = 4.34). For smaller groups divided by small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA), large for gestational age (LGA) and then by gestational age, prematurity was found to be at high risk in SGA (RR = 9.29), AGA (RR = 28.34) and LGA (RR = 21.41) groups. For groups divided by gestational age and then by SGA, AGA and LGA, SGA was found to have significantly high risk in premature (RR = 1.45), mature (RR = 4.41) and postmature (RR = 3.19) groups. Nine groups were divided by the gestational age along with SGA, AGA and LGA, rates of CP were found to be significantly higher in most groups than in the term AGA group. Compared with the rate of CP in the term AGA group, the RR were calculated and showed as followings (from higher to lower), premature SGA (RR = 40.99), premature AGA (RR = 28.34), premature LGA (RR = 21.08), postmature SGA (RR = 8.39), mature SGA (RR = 4.41) and postmature AGA (RR = 2.63).Prematurity and small for gestational age are both independent risk factors for cerebral palsy. Postmaturity and large for gestational age are not risk factors.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the association between third trimester hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and the risk of low birth weight and preterm delivery in a Chinese population.Subjects were women who delivered in four cities/counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, China, during the period of 1995 - 2000. Incidence of low birth weight and preterm delivery was calculated and compared among groups of women with different levels of Hb during the third trimester. Multiple logistic regression was used to address relationships between Hb levels and the risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight while controlling for potential confounding factors.The overall prevalence of anemia during third trimester of pregnancy was 48.2% , mainly consisting of mild and moderate anemia. Mild and moderate anemia did not increase the risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight statistically. The lowest incidence of preterm delivery and low birth weight was found among pregnant women with Hb levels at 90-99 g/L. The risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight increased with either increasing or decreasing hemoglobin concentrations. However,there was no remarkable elevation of the risk when Hb was in the range of 70-119 g/L. Women with severe anemia (Hb< 70 g/L) had 80% higher risk (95% CI:1.0-3.3) of preterm delivery and a 4.0-fold higher risk (95 % CI :2. 1-7.5) of low birth weight compared with women with an Hb value of 90-99 g/L. In addition, women with a high Hb concentration (Hb> 130 g/L) had 20% higher risk (95 % CI: 1..0-1.4) of preterm delivery and 50 % higher risk (95 % CI: 1.2-1.9) of low birth weight.A U-shape relationship was found between Hb concentration and the risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight. Severe anemia and high hemoglobin concentration were both associated with increased risk of preterm deliveries and low birth weight.",

The association between PIH and SGA was also examined according to preterm or term delivery.The incidence of SGA in women with PIH (6.0%) was higher than women without (4.5%), and the incidence increased with severities of PIH. The adjusted relative risk rates (95% CI) of SGA in women with mild,moderate and severe PIH were 1.17 (1.01-1.34), 1.69 (1.33-2.14), and 3.50 (2.57-4.77), respectively, when confounders were controlled for.

        "abstract": "To evaluate whether the Trp64Arg polymorphism in the 3- adrenergic receptor (AR) gene is associated with decreased birth weight and might account for some of the association between birth weight and impaired insulin sensitivity, the 3-AR genotype was assessed in 296 neonates of singleton pregnancies, including 76 neonates classified as small for ges- tational age (SGA) and 220 neonate classified as appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Fasting glucose and insulin levels were measured on d 3 after birth. The insulin levels and insulin-to-glucose ratio were significantly higher in the SGA group than in the AGA group. Frequency of the Trp64Arg allele was similar in the AGA and SGA groups (0.15 and 0.17, respectively). Moreover, when we adjusted for sex and gesta- tional age, there was no significant difference in birth weight, fasting glucose, insulin levels, or insulin-to-glucose ratio be- tween those with and without the mutation. However, in the SGA group, carriers of the Trp64Arg allele had significantly higher fasting insulin levels and insulin-to-glucose ratios than noncarriers (17.54 2.11 vs. 13.18 1.47 IU/ml, P < 0.05; and 4.89 0.60 vs. 3.14 0.42, P < 0.05, respectively), whereas no association was detected for this polymorphism in the AGA group. SGA is an important factor that predisposes to insulin re- sistance, and the Trp64Arg 3-AR gene polymorphism may contribute to insulin resistance associated with reduced fetal growth.

        "abstract": "To study the prevalence rates of birth defects in high and low risk areas in China.A population-based surveillance system on birth defects was used to obtain the prevalence rates of 24 kinds of major external birth defects from > or = 20 weeks of gestation to 7 days of life in selected areas in Shanxi and Jiangsu provinces.The birth prevalence of birth defects (232.4 per 10,000 births) and neural tube defects (NTDs) (138.7 per 10,000 births) in four counties of Shanxi province were significantly higher than that in Taiyuan city (75.3 and 28.2 per 10,000 births, respectively). There was no significant difference for all selected birth defects between Wuxi city and Xishan counties in low risk areas. There was a 6.1-fold of higher prevalence for NTDs in Taiyuan city compared with that in Wuxi areas (4.6 per 10,000 births). In four counties of Shanxi province, the prevalence rates of anencephaly, spina bifida, hydrocephaly, cleft palate alone and polydactyly were significantly higher than in Wuxi areas. The NTDs prevalence rate in four counties of Shanxi was 30.2 times higher than in Wuxi areas. When compared with previous surveillance data, the NTDs prevalence rate did not present obvious declining trend in high risk areas. The birth prevalence rate had a 31.8% decrease when births were calculated after 28 gestational weeks and compared with those from 20 gestational weeks.NTDs remained to be the most common birth defect seen in Shanxi province. The birth prevalence rate of NTDs in some areas of Shanxi province was among the highest that ever reported in the world in comparison with data from other countries and regions. The current prevalence rate in high risk areas in Shanxi province did not clearly show a declining trend. Programs on surveillance and prenatal diagnosis were proved to have made big impact on the rates of major external birth defects.",

        "abstract": "To describe the epidemiological characters of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in Jiaxing areas of Zhejiang province of China between 1995 and 2000.We analyzed the perinatal health surveillance data that was collected as part of the Sino-American cooperative project on neural tube defects prevention established in 1992. The study population consisted of 136 070 pregnant women with at least 20 weeks of gestational age. National diagnostic criteria were used to identify the cases which were divided into three subgroups: mild, moderate and severe.15 127 cases were identified and the overall incidence rate of PIH was 11.1% (95% CI : 11.0% - 11.3%). Among all the cases, mild, moderate and severe PIH were accounted for 71.4%, 22.3% and 6.3%, respectively. The proportions of PIH cases that occurred in the second trimester, third trimester and during delivery appeared to be 4.2%, 34.4% and 61.4%, respectively. There was a significant fall in the trend of PIH occurrence every year, which dropped from 10.7% in 1995 to 8.6% in 2000 by 19.6%. More risk of PIH seemed to be related to those mothers living in the urban areas with age under 20 or above 35, being peasants and having little educational, having had multiple gestations, conceiving in spring/summer or delivering in winter or spring etc. Compared with the results of national survey in 1988, the incidence rate of PIH was higher by 18.1%, while the proportion of severe PIH was much lower by 68.8%. Although the incidence rates of PIH in urban and rural areas were somehow similar, the proportion of severe PIH in rural areas was much higher than that in urban areas.Overall incidence rate and distribution of PIH were reported. Compared with the results in 1988, incidence rate of PIH was much higher, particularly for mild cases.",

The study population consisted of 83 159 women who attended premarital or preconception medical physical examination and delivered single live births with at least 20 gestational weeks from 1995 to 2000 in Jiaxing area. The Chi-square test was employed to test the difference in the rates of PIH among groups with different BMI. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to examine the association between prepregnancy BMI and the risk of PIH.The rate of PIH was 11.01% (9153/83 159; 95% CI: 10.79% - 11.22%). The rate of PIH among women with BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2), 18.5 - 22.9 kg/m(2), 23.0 - 24.9 kg/m(2), and > or = 25.0 kg/m(2) were 9.08% (1405/15 472; 95% CI: 8.63% - 9.54%), 10.82% (6389/59 054; 95% CI: 10.57% - 11.07%), 14.63% (943/6444; 95% CI: 13.78% - 15.52%), and 19.00% (416/2189; 95% CI: 17.38% - 20.71%), respectively, the difference was significant (chi(trend)(2) = 261.028, P = 0.000). Taking those with BMI 18.5 - 22.9 kg/m(2) as reference, the unadjusted RR for PIH was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77 - 0.87) among women with BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2), 1.41 (95% CI: 1.31 - 1.52) among women with BMI 23.0 - 24.9 kg/m(2), and 1.93 (95% CI: 1.73 - 2.16) among women with BMI > or = 25.0 kg/m(2). After controlling for area, maternal age at delivery, educational level, occupation, parity, times of prenatal visit as well as the individual or family history of chronic hypertension, the estimated RR were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80 - 0.90), 1.37 (95% CI: 1.27 - 1.47) and 1.88 (95% CI: 1.68 - 2.10), respectively.High prepregnancy BMI could increase the risk of PIH.",

No phase transformation was detected during oral temperature. It indicated that these types of NiTi wires did not possess shape memory property. For C and H NiTi wires, no phase transformation was detected during the scanning temperature range, suggesting that these two types of wires did not possess shape memory either. The austenite finish temperatures of E, G and I NiTi wires were 34.3 degrees C, 36.6 degrees C, 38.5 degrees C, respectively, which were close to the oral temperature and presented as martensitic-austenitic structures at room temperature, suggesting that the NiTi wires listed above had good shape memory effect. Although F NiTi wire also showed martensitic-austenitic structures at room temperature, its austenite finish temperature (61.5 degrees C) was much higher than oral temperature.The transformation phase temperatures and transformation behavior were varied among different NiTi alloys, leading to variability in shape memory effect.",

        "abstract": "The shape memory effect of nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires is largely determined by the phase transition temperature. It is associated with a reversible transformation from martensite to austenite. The aim of this study was to characterize austenite, martensite and R phase temperatures as well as transition temperature ranges of the commonly used clinical NiTi orthodontic arch wires selected from several manufacturers.Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method was used to study the phase transformation temperatures and the phase transition processes of 9 commonly used clinical NiTi alloys (types: 0.40 mm (0.016 inch), 0.40 mm x 0.56 mm (0.016 inch x 0.022 inch)).The austenite finish temperatures (Af) of 0.40 mm Smart, Ormco and 3M NiTi wires were lower than the room temperature, and no phase transformation was detected during oral temperature. Therefore, we predicted that these types of NiTi did not possess shape memory property. For 0.40 mm and 0.40 mm x 0.56 mm Youyan I NiTi wires, no phase transformation was detected during the scanning temperature range, suggesting that these two types of wires did not possess shape memory either. The Af of 0.40 mm x 0.56 mm Smart, L&H, Youyan II Ni-Ti wires were close to the oral temperature and presented as martensitic-austenitic structures at room temperature, suggesting the NiTi wires listed above have good shape memory effect. Although the 0.40 mm x 0.56 mm Damon CuNiTi wire showed martensitic-austenitic structures at oral temperature, its Af was much higher than the oral temperature. It means that transformation from martensite to austenite for this type of NiTi only finishes when oral temperature is above normal.The phase transformation temperatures and transformation behavior varied among different commonly used NiTi orthodontic arch wires, leading to variability in shape memory effect.",

Each orthodontist was asked to independently rate the severity of every case into five grades: mild, mildly moderate, moderate, severely moderate and severe. Rating data was finally gathered to evaluate the intra-judge's reliability and the inter-judges' consistency.Weighted Kappa test revealed that 8.33% orthodontists showed excellent intra-judge's reliability (Kappa \u2265 0.81), 78.33% orthodontists showed good intra-judge's reliability (Kappa \u2265 0.61) and 96.67% specialists displayed general intra-judge's reliability (Kappa \u2265 0.41). And intra-class correlation coefficient demonstrated a high level of inter-judges' consistency (r=0.989, P<0.01).Good intra-judge's reliability and inter-judges' consistency can be demonstrated in the subjective evaluation of malocclusion severity by the Chinese orthodontic experts, which could the basis for establishing the objective grading system of malocclusion severity.",

The first image showed an altered intercanine width, while the second one showed an altered oral fissure breadth. These alterations were independently rated by judges, including 23 orthodontists and 30 undergraduates. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the scores given by male and female judges and those given by professional and nonprofessional judges.\u2002 The following ideal transverse ratios were determined: intercanine width/oral fissure breadth, 0.638; oral fissure breadth/interparopia width: the distance between left and right paropia, 0.617; and intercanine width/face width at the level of the labial commissures, 0.300. A range of -10% to +10% was proposed as the thresholds of esthetic smile evaluations. It was shown that gender of the raters had no effect on the rating of photographs, nor were there any statistically significant differences between the professional and nonprofessional judges' ratings.\u2002 Balanced transverse relationships in the facial region are important for smile esthetics, and there is a wide range of esthetically acceptable variations in the transverse relationships between the maxillary arch, mouth, and face.",

        "title": "Mid-infrared diode laser spectroscopy of SO+",
        "abstract": "The absorption spectrum of the fundamental band of SO + ( X 2 \u03a0) has been recorded using a mid-infrared tunable diode laser spectrometer with the velocity modulation technique in an AC glow discharge of He/SO 2 . Forty-two lines of SO + were identified in the spectral range of 1230\u20131330 cm \u22121 . The observed rovibrational transitions together with the microwave data published previously were fitted to a standard effective Hamiltonian for 2 \u03a0 states. Molecular constants for the ground and \u03c5 = 1 vibrational states were derived. The band origin was determined to be 1291.5299(27) cm \u22121 . Keywords Rotational analysis Infrared spectrum SO + 1 Introduction The SO + molecular ion is an important species of considerable chemical and astrophysical interest. It is the major components of plasmas containing sulfur and oxygen. It has been detected in interstellar molecular clouds [1\u20134] , comet Halley [5] and the Io torus [6\u20138] . The spectroscopic characteristics of SO + have been studied for more than three decades. For a brief review of previous experimental and theoretical studies on SO + , see Ref. [9] and references therein. In 1974, a potential energy diagram for SO + was constructed by Dyke et al. based on the photoelectron spectroscopic data of SO radicals [10] . In 1980, Tsuji et al. first assigned the emission spectrum observed from the helium afterglow reaction of SO 2 in the 250\u2013540 nm region to the A 2 \u03a0 \u2212 X 2 \u03a0 r system of SO + [11] . This assignment was re-checked by measurements of isotope shifts between S 16 O + and S 18 O + bands [12] . In 1983, Cossart et al. gave the first rotational analysis of several bands of the A 2 \u03a0 i \u2212 X 2 \u03a0 r and b 4 \u03a3 \u2212 \u2212 a 4 \u03a0 i transitions [13] . In a parallel study, Coxcon and Foster recorded nine bands of the A 2 \u03a0 i \u2212 X 2 \u03a0 r system [14] . Hardwick et al. [15] re-investigated the 0\u20135, 0\u20136, 1\u20135 and 1\u20136 bands in higher resolution and reported a self-consisted molecular constants for \u03c5 \u2032 = 0 and 1 levels of A and for \u03c5 \u2033 = 4\u20139 levels of X . The A 2 \u03a0 i \u2212 X 2 \u03a0 r system of SO + have also been observed in rotationally cold supersonic expansion and the most complete molecular constants for the X 2 \u03a0 r and A 2 \u03a0 i states have been obtained [16,17] . In 1991, Amano et al. reported the microwave spectrum of SO + and determined more precise molecular constants for the ground state [18] . No infrared spectrum has been reported. In addition, several theoretical calculations have been carried out for SO + . Cossart et al. [13] performed an ab initio calculations using the self-consistent field (SCF) method followed by configuration interaction (CI) to interpret their observed spectra. Ornellas et al. [19] reported a theoretical characterization of quartet states of SO + using the internally contracted multi-reference configuration interaction approach and natural orbits. Recently, Houria et al. [9] carried out a spectroscopic and spin\u2013orbit calculations on SO + using highly correlated ab initio methods. In this paper, we report the first observation of the infrared absorption spectrum of SO + ( X 2 \u03a0) using a tunable diode laser spectrometer with the velocity modulation technique [20] . Rovibrational transitions for both \u03a9 = 1/2 and 3/2 subbands have been recorded. Our observed transitions were analyzed together with the microwave data reported by Amano et al. [18] . 2 Experimental details The mid-infrared tunable diode laser spectrometer used to record the absorption spectrum of SO + has been described in detail elsewhere [21,22] . Briefly, the infrared radiations are emitted from the lead-salt diode lasers which are mounted in a liquid-nitrogen cooled Dewar (Model L5736, Laser Components). After collimated by a parabolic mirror, the infrared radiations are split into three beams: the major part passes through a 10-mm bore, 1-m long discharge cell, which is pumped by an 8 L/s mechanical pump; the other two parts are firstly chopped by a mechanical chopper at a frequency of about 600 Hz, then transmit through a reference gas cell and a Ge etalon separately. Three lock-in amplifiers (SRS830, Standford Research Systems) are used to demodulate signals from three liquid-nitrogen cooled HgCdTe detectors (J15D12, Judson Technologies LLC) separately. The scan of the current of the diode laser and the data acquisition from three lock-in amplifiers are controlled by a home-developed LabView program simultaneously. The SO + molecular ions were generated by an AC glow discharge of the flowing mixtures of SO 2 (99.99%) and helium(>99.999%). Optimal pressure of SO 2 and He was about 1:20 at a total pressure of 8.5 \u00d7 10 \u22121 mbar measured at the downstream of the discharge cell by a Pirani gauge. The typical peak-to-peak discharge current was 300 mA at 35 kHz. Three laser diodes were used to cover about 30% of the spectral region from 1230 to 1330 cm \u22121 . The absorption spectra of SO + were calibrated against accurate line positions of SO 2 and N 2 O from the HITRAN database [23] and the Ge etalon fringes (FSR \u223c0.049 cm \u22121 ). The absolute accuracy of the calibration was estimated to be 0.005 cm \u22121 . 3 Results and analysis The initial search for the fundamental band of SO + was based on the prediction with molecular parameters reported in Ref. [17,18] . Most observed transitions were within 0.5 cm \u22121 around the predicted frequencies. In the spectral range above 1330 cm \u22121 , no absorption lines of SO + could be identified unambiguously because of the severe congestion by dense lines from the v 3 fundamental band of SO 2 . Forty-two rovibrational transitions were recorded and assigned to the P - and R -branches of the fundamental band of SO + , as listed in Table 1 . P 1 e , P 1 f , R 1 e and R 1 f designate the branches for the \u03a0 1/2 \u2190 \u03a0 1/2 subband with the parity (e/f) of the lower rotational level and P 2 and R 2 for the \u03a0 3/2 \u2190 \u03a0 3/2 subband. No Q -branch lines were observed due to the low transition intensities. A portion of our observed spectrum is shown in Fig. 1 . As one can see, lines for both \u03a9 = 1/2 and \u03a9 = 3/2 subbands were observed, but the \u039b-doubling splittings of lines were only well resolved for the \u03a9 = 1/2 subband. A weighted least-squares analysis combined our infrared data with the microwave data reported previously in Ref. [18] was carried out using Pickett\u2019s program SPFIT [24] . A standard effective Hamiltonian for 2 \u03a0 states derived by Brown et al. [25] was adopted. The uncertainty of measured frequencies was set to 20 kHz and 100 kHz for pure rotational lines in the \u03a0 1/2 state and in the \u03a0 3/2 state, and 0.005 cm \u22121 for rovibrational lines, respectively. Since the spin\u2013orbit coupling constants for the \u03c5 = 0 and 1 vibrational states, A 0 and A 1 , are highly correlated, A 0 was fixed at the assumed value in Ref. [16] . Because the \u039b-doubling splittings of lines were only well resolved for the \u03a9 = 1/2 subband, the q constant was set to be zero. Due to the well-known intrinsic correlation, the spin\u2013rotation coupling constant \u03b3 and the centrifugal distortion term of the spin\u2013orbit coupling constant A D cannot be determined separately [26] . For the convenience to compare with the fitting results from Ref. [18] , the effective spin\u2013rotation coupling constant \u03b3 eff was chosen to be fitted by assuming A D to be equal to zero. Ten parameters, namely A 1 , B 0 , B 1 , D 0 , D 1 , p 0 , p 1 , \u03b3 eff0 , \u03b3 eff1 and v 0 , were floated in our fit. All the other parameters were set to be zero. The derived molecular parameters are listed in Table 2 . The residuals for our observed rovibrational transitions, obs.-calc., are listed in Table 1 . The standard deviation for the microwave and infrared data in the fit was 0.034 MHz and 0.0023 cm \u22121 , respectively. 4 Discussion and conclusions Although the infrared and microwave data are analyzed together by a weighted least-squares fit, molecular constants for the ground state are determined principally by the microwave data. Our fitting results are only marginally improved over those of Amano et al. [18] , as one can see in Table 2 . The merged values for molecular constants of the ground state from a analysis of all the available electronic and microwave spectrum by Milkman et al. [17] are also listed in Table 2 for comparison. They are in good agreement with each other. Our infrared data enables us to determine molecular constants of the \u03c5 = 1 level for the SO + X state directly for the first time. The derived spin\u2013orbit coupling constant A 1 , the rotational constant B 1 and the band origin v 0 are in good agreement with those calculated with the equilibrium parameters from Ref. [17] , as shown in Table 2 . The band origin of the fundamental band of SO + was determined to be 1291.5299(27) cm \u22121 . The effective spin\u2013rotation coupling constant \u03b3 eff for the \u03c5 = 1 state was determined to be 0.0065(32) cm \u22121 . The sign of \u03b3 eff is negative for the ground state but positive for the \u03c5 = 1 state. The change of the sign of \u03b3 eff probably indicates a substantial change of A D for the \u03c5 = 1 state. The internuclear distance dependence of the spin\u2013orbit coupling constant for the X 2 \u03a0 r state of SO + was first calculated by Cossart et al. [13] , and later by Houria et al. [9] with highly correlated ab initio methods. Both calculations indicate that the r (S\u2013O distance) dependence of the spin\u2013orbit coupling constant is not monotonous around the equilibrium internuclear distance r e , suggesting that A D for the \u03c5 = 1 state can be significantly different from that for the \u03c5 = 0 state. Expression for the parameter A D obtained from a vibrational perturbation treatment [26] is (1) A D \u03c5 = \u2211 \u03c5 \u2032 { \u3008 \u03c5 | B ( r ) | \u03c5 \u2032 \u3009 \u3008 \u03c5 \u2032 | A ( r ) | \u03c5 \u3009 + \u3008 \u03c5 | A ( r ) | \u03c5 \u2032 \u3009 \u3008 \u03c5 \u2032 | B ( r ) | \u03c5 \u3009 } G ( \u03c5 ) - G ( \u03c5 \u2032 ) . For more reliable quantitative analysis, it is necessary to perform ab initio evaluation of the A D value with Eq. (1) . In conclusion, the absorption spectrum of the fundamental band of SO + ( X 2 \u03a0) have been recorded in the mid-infrared region with the powerful velocity modulation technique. Precise molecular constants for the ground and \u03c5 = 1 vibrational states have been determined by a weighted least-squares fit combined our observed lines with the microwave data reported previously. Our results are in good agreement with those of Milkman et al. [17] obtained from a nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure followed by a least-squares merging procedure.

        "abstract": "Four internal-rotation/vibration bands of the Ne-D(2)O complex have been measured in the v(2) bend region of D(2)O using a tunable infrared diode laser spectrometer to probe a slit supersonic expansion. Three ortho bands are excited from the ground state \u03a3(0(00)) to the \u03a3 and \u03a0(1(11), \u03c5(2) = 1) internal rotor states and the n = 1, \u03a3(0(00), \u03c5(2) = 1) stretching-internal rotor combination state. Strong perturbations between the excited vibrational states are evident. The observed spectra are analyzed separately with a three-state J-dependent Coriolis plus J-independent angular-radial coupling model [M. J. Weida and D. J. Nesbitt, J. Chem. Phys. 106, 3078 (1997)] and a three-state Coriolis coupling model [R. C. Cohen and R. J. Saykally, J. Chem. Phys. 95, 7891 (1991)]. The former model works more successfully than the latter. Molecular constants for the ground and excited vibrational states of ortho (20)Ne-D(2)O isotopomer as well as the Coriolis and angular-radial coupling constants are determined accurately. The van der Waals stretching frequency is estimated to be \u03bd(s) = 24.85 cm(-1) in the ground state and decreases to about 20.8 cm(-1) upon vibrational excitation of the D(2)O bend.",

The ions were produced in an ac glow discharge of a mixture of D 2 O and He. Sixty-four transitions with N \u2a7d 11 and K \u2a7d 3 were assigned and fitted, yielding a set of improved rotational, spin-rotational and centrifugal distortion constants of the ground and \u03bd 2 vibrational states. The \u03bd 2 band origin was determined to be 1044.28594(39) cm \u22121 . Keywords Rovibrational spectrum D 2 O + Velocity modulation 1 Introduction The water cation (H 2 O + ) has been the subject of many experimental studies since Whipple conjectured its presence in comet tails in 1950 [1] . Lew and Heiber first reported the visible spectrum of the A \u223c 2 A 1 - X \u223c 2 B 1 transition of H 2 O + in 1973 [2] . It was followed by a detailed analysis by Lew [3] . The high resolution absorption spectra of the A \u223c 2 A 1 - X \u223c 2 B 1 transition have also been recorded in the visible and near-infrared region [4\u20137] . In the IR region, the \u03bd 3 band was detected in absorption in the region 3100\u20133400 cm \u22121 using a tunable difference frequency spectrometer [8] . The \u03bd 2 and 2 \u03bd 2 \u2212 \u03bd 2 bands were recorded in the region 1270\u20131750 cm \u22121 using a diode laser spectrometer [9] . The \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 2 + \u03bd 3 \u2212 \u03bd 2 bands were detected in the region 3180\u20133390 cm \u22121 using a color center laser spectrometer [10] . All the above-mentioned absorption spectra were measured with the velocity modulation technique [11] . The far-infrared laser magnetic resonance spectroscopy has also been used to measure the pure rotational transitions of H 2 O + in the ground state [12,13] . Very detailed information has been obtained for the spectra and structure of H 2 O + from these experimental work. In contrast to the normal species, spectroscopy studies of the deuterated species, HDO + and D 2 O + , are rather scarce. To the best of our knowledge, no high resolution studies have been reported for HDO + , while only two for D 2 O + . Lew and Groleau gave an detailed analysis of 15 bands of the A \u223c 2 A 1 - X \u223c 2 B 1 transition of D 2 O + in 1987 [14] . The observed combination differences in the ground state were used to determine the rotational and spin-rotational constants for the \u03bd 2 = 0, 1 and 3 bending vibrational states. Very recently Gan et al. recorded an absorption spectra of D 2 O + in the visible and near-infrared region using optical heterodyne magnetic rotation enhanced velocity modulation spectroscopy [7] . They obtained a set of molecular constants and rotational term values for the observed vibronic bending levels of the A \u223c 2 A 1 state, with the molecular constants of the ground state fixed at the values derived by Lew and Groleau [14] . Additional low resolution data are available from the photoelectron spectra of H 2 O and D 2 O [15] and the vibrational spectra of H 2 O + , HDO + and D 2 O + isolated in solid neon [16] . Accurate three-dimensional potential energy surface and electric dipole moment functions for the X \u223c 2 B 1 and A \u223c 2 A 1 states of H 2 O + , HDO + and D 2 O + have been calculated by Weis et al. [17] and Brommer et al. [18] . In this paper, we report a direct absorption measurement of the \u03bd 2 fundamental band of D 2 O + ( X \u223c 2 B 1 ) in the region 1000\u20131150 cm \u22121 using a infrared diode laser spectrometer with velocity modulation technique. The observed lines were used to derive a set of improved rotational, spin-rotational and centrifugal distortion constants of the ground and \u03bd 2 vibrational states. The improved molecular constants of the ground state will be helpful to refine the term values of the A \u223c 2 A 1 state or to assist the possible astronomical search. 2 Experiment The infrared diode laser spectrometer used to record the spectrum of D 2 O + has been described in details elsewhere [19] . Briefly, the infrared radiations were emitted from the lead-salt diode laser mounted in a liquid-nitrogen cooled Dewar (Model L5736, Laser Components). After a single pass through a 10-mm bore, 1-m long water-cooled discharge cell, the main part of the laser beam was detected by a liquid-nitrogen cooled HgCdTe detector (Judson Technologies). The output of this detector was demodulated by a lock-in amplifier at the frequency of the discharge. A small portion of the laser beam was reflected by the front CaF 2 window of the discharge cell and then chopped by a mechanical chopper with a frequency at 600 Hz. This chopped beam was divided into two parts further, one for a reference gas cell and the other for a 1-inch Ge etalon, and then detected by two HgCdTe detectors separately. The output of these two detectors was demodulated at the frequency of the mechanical chopper by two lock-in amplifiers separately. The scan of the current of the diode laser and the data acquisition from three lock-in amplifiers were controlled by a home-developed LabView program simultaneously. The D 2 O + ions were generated by an ac glow discharge with a flowing gas mixture of bubbled D 2 O vapor (Merck, 99.9%) and high-purity helium (>99.999%). Velocity modulation technique was used for the detection [11] . The typical discharge frequency and peak-to-peak current were 38 kHz and 300 mA. The optimal gas mixture was at a total pressure of \u223c1.5 Torr., which was measured by a Pirani vacuum gauge at the downstream of the discharge cell. Two diodes were used to cover the 1000\u20131150 cm \u22121 region. The absorption spectra of D 2 O + were calibrated by using the accurate line positions of CH 3 OH and SO 2 from the HITRAN database [20] and the Ge etalon fringes (FSR \u223c 0.049 cm \u22121 ). The absolute accuracy of the calibration was estimated to be 0.005 cm \u22121 . 3 Results and analysis The asymmetry parameter \u03ba = 2 B - A - C A - C is \u22120.682 and \u22120.713 for the \u03bd 2 = 0 and 1 vibrational states of D 2 O + ( X \u223c 2 B 1 ) , respectively, in which the A , B and C rotational constants were taken from Ref. [14] . The \u03bd 2 fundamental mode obeys the b -type selection rules for an asymmetric top: \u0394 N = 0, \u00b1 1; \u0394 K a = \u00b11(\u00b13, \u00b1 5, \u2026); \u0394 K c = \u00b11(\u00b13, \u00b1 5, \u2026). The interaction of the single unpaired electron and the rotation motion splits each rotational level into two spin components ( F 1 : J = N + 1/2; F 2 : J = N \u2212 1/2). The \u0394 J = \u0394 N doublets have the dominant intensity while the \u0394 J \u2260 \u0394 N doublets only have reasonable intensity at low N . The nuclear spin of the deuterium atom ( I = 1) gives a nuclear spin statistical weight of 3 for rotational levels with ( K a , K c ) = ( e , e ), ( o , o ) and 6 for levels with ( K a , K c ) = ( e , o ), ( o , e ), when the vibrational eigenfunction of the lower level is totally symmetric. The rotational structure of the \u03bd 2 = 0 and 1 vibrational states of D 2 O + ( X \u223c 2 B 1 ) can be described by the A -reduced asymmetric top Hamiltonian H R of Watson [21] with additional A -reduced spin-rotation Hamiltonian H SR of Brown and Sears [22] : (1) H R = AN a 2 + BN b 2 + CN c 2 - \u0394 N N 4 - \u0394 NK N 2 N a 2 - \u0394 K N a 4 - 1 2 [ \u03b4 N N 2 + \u03b4 K N a 2 , N + 2 + N - 2 ] + + H N N 6 + H NK N 4 N a 2 + H KN N 2 N a 4 + H K N a 6 + \u22ef (2) H SR = \u03b5 aa N a S a + \u03b5 bb N b S b + \u03b5 cc N c S c + \u0394 N S N 2 ( N \u00b7 S ) + 1 2 \u0394 NK S [ N 2 , N a S a ] + + \u0394 KN S N a 2 ( N \u00b7 S ) + \u0394 K S N a 3 S a + \u22ef The prediction and fitting of the \u03bd 2 fundamental band of D 2 O + were carried out by using Pickett\u2019s program SPFIT/SPCAT [23] . The initial search for the \u03bd 2 fundamental band of D 2 O + was based on the predicted line positions with molecular constants determined by Lew and Groleau [14] . Fig. 1 shows a portion of observed spectrum around 1006 cm \u22121 . The spin-rotational splitting and the nuclear spin statistical weight are well illustrated in Fig. 1 . The rotational temperature was estimated to be about 500 K by comparing the relative intensity of observed lines with that calculated by the program SPCAT [23] at different trial temperature. Observed lines with lower rotational numbers ( N \u2a7d 4, K a \u2a7d 2) could be assigned straightforward according to the prediction. Those lines with higher rotational numbers could only be assigned by sequentially assigning and fitting the data. Occasionally, due to the incomplete discrimination of the strong absorption of neutral species by velocity modulation technique, some strong transitions of the \u03bd 2 band of D 2 16 O [24] could be recorded in the same laser mode as the \u03bd 2 fundamental band of D 2 O + in an opposite phase, as shown in Fig. 1 . Table 1 lists all the observed lines which were assigned to the \u03bd 2 fundamental band of D 2 O + . The observed lines were used to fit the molecular constants for the \u03bd 2 = 0 and 1 vibrational states of D 2 O + simultaneously. The combination differences from the electronic spectrum [7,14] were not included because they degraded either the parameter values or the standard deviation. Various trial fits were used to test the significance of the sextic rotational centrifugal distortion constants and the quartic spin-rotational distortion constants. Since only rovibrational transitions with K a \u2a7d 3 but with N up to 11 were recorded in this work, the H N constant was included instead of the H K constant. The inclusion of the \u0394 K S and \u0394 KN S constants was found to be necessary to fit the data satisfactorily. In the final fit, 64 lines were used to fit 29 parameters, namely, the vibrational band origin, all the rotational parameters, the quartic rotational centrifugal distortion parameters, the diagonal spin-rotation parameters, H N , \u0394 K S and \u0394 KN S , while the rest of the parameters were fixed at zero. The standard deviation of the fit was 0.0035 cm \u22121 . The resulting parameters are listed in Table 2 . The differences between the observed line positions and the calculated are also listed in Table 1 . 4 Discussion and conclusions The molecular constants derived from this work are compared with those of Lew and Groleau from the electronic emission spectrum [14] and Weis et al. from the ab initio calculations [17] , as listed in Table 2 . Our results are in good agreement with those of Lew and Groleau [14] but with much higher precision. The B and C constants for the \u03bd 2 = 0 and 1 states calculated by Weis et al. [17] are in excellent agreement with the experiment, but the A constants have large negative deviations, which is very similar to the case for H 2 O + [9] . The calculated quartic rotational distortion constants for the ground state are also in good agreement with the experiment. The newly determined ground state molecular constants of D 2 O + can be used to calculate the term values of rotational levels with N \u2a7d 11 and K \u2a7d 3 accurately, and they will be helpful to refine the term values of the A \u223c 2 A 1 state or to assist the possible astronomical search. Lew and Groleau determined the \u03bd 2 band origin of D 2 O + by simply taking the difference between r R 0, N (0) lines in the \u03a0 sub-bands of (14, 0) and (14, 1) of the A \u223c 2 A 1 - X \u223c 2 B 1 transition [14] . But their reported value, 1044.27(5) cm \u22121 , is very close to our result, 1044.28594(39) cm \u22121 . The calculated band origin from Weis et al. [17] and Brommer et al. [18] are 1048.1 and 1047.43 cm \u22121 , respectively, which are higher than this experiment. The observed \u03bd 2 fundamental band of D 2 16 O + isolated in neon matrix is 1040.5 cm \u22121 [16] , showing a red shift to the band origin in the gas phase. In conclusion, the \u03bd 2 fundamental band of D 2 O + was recorded for the first time by using a tunable diode laser spectrometer with velocity modulation technique. A set of improved molecular constants for the ground and \u03bd 2 vibrational states was derived. The excellent agreement of molecular constants between the experiment and the ab initio MRCI calculations suggests the high accuracy of the latter.

        "abstract": "The rovibrational spectra of four isotopomers of the Kr-N2O van der Waals complex, namely 82Kr-N2O, 83Kr-N 2O, 84Kr-N2O and 86Kr-N2O, were measured in the v1 vibrational band region of the N2O monomer (\u223c 1285 cm-1) using a tunable diode laser spectrometer to probe a pulsed supersonic slit jet. Rotational constants for both ground and excited vibrational states of these four isotopomers were accurately determined. The band-origin of Kr-N2O was observed to shift by +0.1065 cm -1 from that of the monomer. The band-origin shifts of Rg-N 2O (Rg = Ne, Ar, Kr) in the v1 vibrational band region could also be well explained by the model based on a Buckingham intermolecular potential [W.A. Herrebout, H.-B. Qian, H. Yamaguchi and B.J. Howard, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 189, 235 (1998)]. But the band-origin shift of He-N2O was found to deviate significantly from this model.

Both a-type and b-type transitions were observed for these two complexes. All transitions are doubled, due to the heavy water tunneling within the complexes. Assuming the tunneling splittings are the same in Ka = 0 and Ka = 1, the band origins, all three rotational and several distortion constants of each tunneling state were determined for N2-D2O in the ground and excited vibrational states, and for OC-D2O in the excited vibrational state, respectively. The averaged band origin of OC-D2O is blueshifted by 2.241 cm-1 from that of the v2 band of the D2O monomer, compared with 1.247 cm-1 for N2-D2O. The tunneling splitting of N2-D2O in the ground state is 0.16359(28) cm-1, which is about five times that of OC-D 2O. The tunneling splittings decrease by about 26% for N 2-D2O and 23% for OC-D2O, respectively, upon excitation of the D2O bending vibration, indicating an increase of the tunneling barrier in the excited vibrational state. The tunneling splittings are found to have a strong dependence on intramolecular vibrational excitation as well as a weak dependence on quantum number Ka. \u00a9 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",

Keywords Rovibrational spectrum van der Waals complex N 2 \u2013N 2 O 1 Introduction In the past three decades more than thirty van der Waals complexes containing nitrous oxide (N 2 O) have been studied by high resolution infrared and/or microwave spectroscopy [1] . These studies have provided a wealth of information on the structure, dynamics and intermolecular interactions in the N 2 O-containing complexes. Spectroscopic investigations of the N 2 \u2013N 2 O and O 2 \u2013N 2 O complexes are of atmospheric interest, because a precise characterization of the weak interactions between N 2 or O 2 and N 2 O is essential for accurate calculations of the N 2 or O 2 pressure-broadening coefficients of N 2 O [2] . The rotationally resolved infrared spectrum of the N 2 \u2013N 2 O complex was first reported by Randall et al. [3] in the \u03bd 3 asymmetric stretching mode region of N 2 O monomer. A near T-shaped geometry was determined from the rotational constants and rationalized by the construction of potentials using a distributed multipole and distributed dispersion model. In order to gain a more detailed structure of this complex, Leung [4] studied the rotational spectrum of 15 N 2 \u2013 14 N 2 O using a pulsed molecular beam Fourier transform microwave spectrometer. With the rotational constants and the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants, four possible structures of 15 N 2 \u2013 14 N 2 O were determined. These structures are all planar and approximately T-shaped, with N 2 forming the leg of the T. The 15 N 2 axis and the 14 N 2 O axis were found to make an angle of 13\u00b0 and 81\u00b0 with the intermolecular axis, respectively [4] . The infrared spectrum of the O 2 \u2013N 2 O complex was first investigated in the nitrogen matrix [5] and later in the molecular beam [6] . The equilibrium structure of the O 2 \u2013N 2 O complex was experimentally determined to be planar but with an effective out-of-plane angle of 23\u00b0 [6] . The angles between the O 2 /N 2 O axis and the intermolecular axis were determined to be either \u03b8 O 2 = 58\u00b0 and \u03b8 N 2 O = 77\u00b0, or \u03b8 O 2 = 122\u00b0 and \u03b8 N 2 O = 100\u00b0 [6] . The band-origin of O 2 \u2013N 2 O in the N 2 O \u03bd 3 region has a small shift of +0.36635 cm \u22121 from that of the N 2 O monomer [6] , compared with a large shift of +2.2327 cm \u22121 for N 2 \u2013N 2 O [3] . To our knowledge, no high-level ab initio intermolecular potential energy surfaces (PES) have been reported for these two complexes. The present paper reports the observation and analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of N 2 \u2013N 2 O in the \u03bd 1 symmetric stretching mode region of N 2 O monomer. A set of improved molecular constants for the ground and excited vibrational states has been determined from a global analysis of our observed spectrum and the data observed previously in the N 2 O v 3 region [3] . An ab initio two-dimensional intermolecular potential energy surface for N 2 \u2013N 2 O is used to determine the orientation of the monomers in the complex. 2 Experimental The rovibrational spectrum of N 2 \u2013N 2 O was measured with a tunable infrared diode laser spectrometer which has been described in detail elsewhere [7,8] . A Pb-salt infrared diode laser was operated in a rapid scan mode [9] . The laser current was ramped by a laser controller (Laser Components, L5830) at a frequency of 1 kHz. The laser beam was reflected 120 times through a pulsed supersonic jet expansion by a pair of astigmatic mirrors. A home-made 30 mm \u00d7 200 \u03bcm slit nozzle was attached to a 0.8 mm pin-hole pulsed valve (General Valve series 9). An air-spaced internally coupled confocal Fabry\u2013Perot interferometer (ic-FBI) [10] with a free spectral range of about 0.01 cm \u22121 was used for relative frequency calibration. The strong absorption lines of the N 2 O monomer in the slit jet and their accurate frequency positions in HITRAN [11] were used for absolute frequency calibration. The absolute accuracy of the frequency calibration was estimated to be about 0.0005 cm \u22121 . The direct absorption signal from the jet and the interferometer fringes were digitized by a two-channel 14-bit 50 MHz A/D card (NI PXI-5122) and transferred to an embedded controller (NI PXI-8186). A LabView program was developed to acquire and process the data. A software line-locking scheme with a strong absorption line of N 2 O in the slit jet as the wavelength reference was used to correct the laser frequency drift during signal averaging [12] . The N 2 \u2013N 2 O complexes were generated in the supersonic expansion using about 0.3% N 2 O and 3% N 2 diluted in helium. The gases were pre-mixed in a gas cylinder before use. The optimal stagnation pressure was about 14 atmospheres. The opening time of the nozzle was about 1500 ms with a repetition rate of 5 Hz. The average pressure during valve operation in the vacuum chamber was 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mbar. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Rotational analysis The absorption spectrum of N 2 \u2013N 2 O has been measured in the spectral region between 1284.1 and 1285.9 cm \u22121 . Fig. 1 shows a portion of our observed spectrum. The spectrum was synthesized by several individual frequency scans. Each scan was averaged for more than 2000 gas pulses. The line-width of most isolated lines is about 0.002 cm \u22121 . Lines marked with an asterisk are due to absorption of N 2 O monomer in the slit jet. The spectrum observed in the N 2 O \u03bd 1 region was very similar to that observed in the N 2 O \u03bd 3 region [3] . The assignment was straightforward using a conventional Watson S -reduction Hamiltonian [13] and molecular constants reported in Ref. [3] . A total of 152 b -type transitions were assigned, with J up to 20 and K a up to 4, while no a -type transitions were found under the present sensitivity. Due to the limited spectral coverage of our diode lasers, most of these transitions belong to the Q - or P -branch. A global analysis of these transitions and 65 transitions assigned previously in the N 2 O \u03bd 3 region [3] were performed to determine molecular constants for both ground and excited vibrational states using the SPFIT/SPCAT program [14] . In the final fit, the band-origin \u03bd 0 , three rotational constants ( A , B , C ) and two centrifugal distortion constants ( D J , D JK ) for all three vibrational states were floated. The centrifugal distortion constants d 1 and d 2 for two excited vibrational states were constrained to their values in the ground state. Even with a largely expanded dataset, the centrifugal distortion constant D K could not be well determined and so was fixed at zero. The resulting molecular constants are listed in Table 1 and the observed transitions and their residues are given in Table SI of the supplementary material . The standard deviation of the fit is 0.00037 cm \u22121 , which is within the experimental uncertainty. A simulated spectrum with molecular constants in Table 1 and a rotational temperature of 8 K is shown in Fig. 1 b. The simulated spectrum of N 2 \u2013N 2 O reproduces the observed spectrum very well. However, there are several lines whose observed intensities are significantly weaker than their predicted intensities, for example, the lines near 1284.573 and 1284.822 cm \u22121 . This discrepancy is still not understood. Other van der Waals complexes or clusters formed in the supersonic expansion of He/N 2 /N 2 O, such as He\u2013N 2 O [7] , (N 2 O) 2 [15] and (N 2 O) 3 [16] , are also possible to be detected in the N 2 O \u03bd 1 region. No transitions of He\u2013N 2 O were identified due to the relatively high rotational temperature in our jet. Some lines could be readily assigned to the transitions of the nonpolar isomer of (N 2 O) 2 with high values of J and K a [15] . But many weak lines and even several strong lines remain unassigned. For example, two strong lines which are partially overlapped by the 1 11 \u20132 20 and 1 10 \u20132 21 K -doublets around 1284.39 cm \u22121 were not able to be assigned to any of the above-mentioned complexes. The newly determined molecular constants for the ground and N 2 O \u03bd 3 -excited vibrational states are in good agreement with those reported in Ref. [3] except D JK in the ground state. In previous study [3] , D J and D JK for the N 2 O \u03bd 3 -excited vibrational state were constrained to their ground state values. Our results show D JK for the ground state, 348(17) kHz, is slightly smaller than that for the N 2 O \u03bd 3 -excited excited vibrational state, 511(59) kHz. The determined centrifugal distortion constants for N 2 \u2013N 2 O are very similar to those for its isoelectronic complex CO\u2013N 2 O [17\u201319] . The band-origin of our observed spectrum is determined to be \u03bd 0 = 1285.73964(14) cm \u22121 , with a blue-shift of +0.8363 cm \u22121 from that of N 2 O monomer, compared with +2.2325 cm \u22121 in the N 2 O \u03bd 3 region [3] . 3.2 Structural analysis The effective structure of N 2 \u2013N 2 O was derived from the rotational constants using a similar approach which was applied to CO\u2013N 2 O by Qian and Howard [18] . Assuming the geometries of the monomers remain unchanged upon complexation, the structure of N 2 \u2013N 2 O is defined by four Jacobi coordinates as shown in Fig. 2 , where R is the intermolecular distance between the N 2 and N 2 O centers of mass, \u03b8 N 2 is the enclosed angle between the N\u2013N axis and R , \u03b8 N 2 O is the enclosed angle between the N\u2013N\u2013O axis and R , and \u03c6 is the dihedral angle between the two subunits. The calculated inertial defects ( \u0394 = I c \u2212 I b \u2212 I a ) for three vibrational states are 1.98(8), 2.02(9) and 1.99(12) amu \u00c5 2 , respectively. The small positive values of the inertial defect indicate the complex is planar ( \u03c6 = 0). For a planar structure, R can be determined from C constant by the following formula: R = k \u03bc 1 C - 1 b N 2 O - 1 b N 2 1 / 2 , where \u03bc is the reduced mass of the complex, b N 2 O , b N 2 are the rotational constants of N 2 O [20] and N 2 [21] , k is a conversion factor (505 379 MHz amu \u00c5 2 ). The distance R in the ground state, 3.6926(3) \u00c5, increases slightly to 3.6929(3) and 3.6954(4) \u00c5 in the N 2 O \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 -excited vibrational states, respectively, indicating the complex is slightly expanded upon vibrational excitation. For a planar molecule, only two out of the three rotational constants are independent because the moments of inertia have a planar relationship: I c \u2248 I a + I b . The C constant has been used to determine R , so only one more constant, A or B , remains to determine the angles \u03b8 N 2 and \u03b8 N 2 O . Obviously their values cannot be determined separately. In the absence of isotopic substitution data it is impossible to determine the orientation of the subunits within the complex from the rotational constants. In order to get some indications about the structural angles, Randall et al. calculated the intermolecular potential energy curves for N 2 \u2013N 2 O in the T-shaped form ( \u03b8 N 2 + \u03b8 N 2 O = 90 \u2218 ) and the slipped parallel form ( \u03b8 N 2 = \u03b8 N 2 O ) using a distributed multipole and distributed dispersion model [3] . Considering the rough approximations of this model and constrains used in the calculation, it is necessary to construct a more precise intermolecular potential energy surface for N 2 \u2013N 2 O. For this purpose, an ab initio two-dimensional intermolecular potential energy surface will be calculated and used to determine the possible structure in the next section. 4 Intermolecular potential The N 2 and N 2 O monomers were assumed to be rigid and were frozen at their equilibrium structures: r (N\u2013N) = 1.0977 \u00c5 for N 2 [21] , r (N\u2013N) = 1.1273 \u00c5 and r (N\u2013O) = 1.1851 \u00c5 for N 2 O [22] , respectively. The intermolecular potential energy of N 2 \u2013N 2 O for a given geometry was calculated at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] level [23] , using aug-cc-pVDZ basis sets [24] for all atoms supplemented with bond functions (3s3p2d) [25] placed at the midpoint of R . The supermolecular approach was used, where the intermolecular interaction energy was the difference between the dimer energy and the energy of the N 2 and N 2 O monomers. The full counterpoise correction [26] was used to account for the basis set superposition error. All the calculations were carried out with the Molpro 2009.1 package [27] . The intermolecular potential was calculated for geometries with R fixed at its averaged ground state value, 3.6926 \u00c5, with angles \u03b8 N 2 and \u03b8 N 2 O varied from 0 to 360\u00b0 in steps of 10\u00b0, and with \u03c6 fixed at 0. A total of 1369 data points for the intermolecular potential energy were obtained ( Table S2 in the supplemental material ). The PES was constructed using the cubic spline interpolation method. The global minimum occurs at \u03b8 N 2 = 11.0\u00b0 and \u03b8 N 2 O = 84.3\u00b0, with a well depth of 326.64 cm \u22121 . Saddle point between the two equivalent minima ( \u03b8 N 2 = 11.0\u00b0 or 191.0\u00b0) occurs at \u03b8 N 2 = 97.4\u00b0 and \u03b8 N 2 O = 92.2\u00b0, with a barrier height of 204.61 cm \u22121 , which implies a hindered in-plane bending motion of the N 2 subunit. Fig. 3 shows constant energy contours of the two-dimensional PES with R and \u03c6 fixed at 3.6926 \u00c5 and 0, respectively. 5 Discussion and conclusion The equilibrium structural angles of the complex, predicted from the restricted two-dimensional intermolecular potential, are \u03b8 N 2 = 11.0\u00b0 and \u03b8 N 2 O = 84.3\u00b0. This equilibrium structure is in good agreement with the third possible structure of 15 N 2 \u2013 14 N 2 O (Fig. 6iii in Ref. [4] ) determined from the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants, in which the N 2 axis is pointing towards the terminal N nuclei of N 2 O and the O end of N 2 O is closer to the N 2 monomer than the N end. From the intermolecular PES of CO\u2013N 2 O estimated with the model of Muenter [28] , the global minimum was found at R = 3.87 \u00c5, \u03b8 CO = 15\u00b0 and \u03b8 N 2 O = 86\u00b0, with a well depth of 322 cm \u22121 [18] . Obviously, the structural angles and well depth of N 2 \u2013N 2 O are very similar to those of CO\u2013N 2 O. The effective intermolecular distance of N 2 \u2013N 2 O ( R = 3.6926 \u00c5) is slightly shorter than that of CO\u2013N 2 O ( R = 3.87 \u00c5). The band-origin of CO\u2013N 2 O in the N 2 O \u03bd 3 region was observed to shift +2.9054 cm \u22121 from that of the N 2 O monomer [18] , compared with +2.2325 cm \u22121 for N 2 \u2013N 2 O. A blue-shift of the band-origin means the intermolecular interaction becomes weaker upon vibrational excitation. From this point of view, the intermolecular interaction between CO and N 2 O might be slightly weaker than that between N 2 and N 2 O even though CO has a permanent electric dipole moment. A more quantitative comparison need to calculate the intermolecular PES of CO\u2013N 2 O at the same level of computational method and basis sets for N 2 \u2013N 2 O. Two internal motion states due to the internal motion of the 15 N 2 subunit have been observed in the pure rotational spectrum of 15 N 2 \u2013 14 N 2 O [4] . Transitions between these two internal motion states are unobservable due to the forbidden of spin flip. In our infrared spectrum as well as that observed by Randall et al. [3] , no evidence of tunneling splitting was observed. The change of the barrier height upon the \u03bd 1 vibrational excitation of N 2 O is probably too small to be resolved under our experimental conditions. In conclusion, the high resolution spectrum of the N 2 \u2013N 2 O van der Waals complex has been recorded in the N 2 O \u03bd 1 region. The rotational and centrifugal distortion constants for the ground and excited vibrational states are accurately determined from a global analysis of the available data in both the N 2 O \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 3 regions. The averaged intermolecular distance in the ground state is determined to be R = 3.6926 \u00c5. The equilibrium structure of the complex, predicted from the restricted two-dimensional intermolecular potential energy, are \u03b8 N 2 = 11.0\u00b0 and \u03b8 N 2 O = 84.3\u00b0. This structure shows a remarkable similarity to that of the isoelectronic complex CO\u2013N 2 O.

Group A: Implanted the ADSCs combined with the extract of Eucommiol scaffold, group B: Implanted the ADSCs combined with hydroxyapatite materials, group C: Implanted hydroxyapatite materials, group D: The control group. All the experimental animals were sacrificed after 2, 4, 8, 12 weeks. Tissue samples were observed by gross observation, radiographic analysis, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, scanning electron microscope (SEM). The value of imaging analysis and osteogenesis were evaluated. The results were analyzed by SPSS 17.0 statistical software.In vivo imaging and histological staining showed that the healing of bone defect and bone quality in group A was significantly better than those in the other groups. SEM showed well biocompatibility between composite material and tissue without inflammation reaction. By measuring and analyzing the dental CT data and new bone area, the bone in group A was obviously better than those in other groups (P < 0.05).The extract of Eucommiol can promote ADSCs into bone cells. The role of ADSCs combined with extract of Eucommiol scaffold materials has significant bone induction. It is expected that this material could become a new composite material and be used to fix the jaw bone defects.",

Cells were adherently cultured in vitro, and P2 or P3 BMMSCs populations were collected and examined. Cell growth was observed by inverted microscopy; the propagation of BMMSCs were tested by MTT and a growth curve was drawn after statistical analysis; colony-forming unit-fibroblast(CFU-F) was detected by examination of colony formation; the potential of multi-directional differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells was estimated by pertinent methods; the surface marks of BMMSCs were detected by flow cytometry, the data was analysed using SPSS16.0 software package.The majority of adherent cells were long fusiform, and few were small triangle; the growth curve of BMMSCs showed that every passage experienced incubation period, log phase and platform period; the rate of colony formation was 37%. Growth of BMMSCs represented the appearance of CFU-F; BMMSCs after inducted differentiation showed osteogenic and adipogenic potential. The staining of mineralized nodules was positive by alizarin red S and the positive staining of oil red O appeared in lipid drops around cell nucleus. The staining of skeletal muscle cells was positive by desmin immunofluorescence; the cell surface marks assessed with flow cytometry indicated that these BMMSCs expressed CD90 and CD146 in high percentage (about 98.7% and 98.1%, respectively).The highly uniformed BMMSCs derived from rabbit mandible can be collected. These BMMSCs have the ability of self-replication and propagation, as well as potential of multi-directional differentiation in vitro.",

The research results of the controlling factors of oil reservoirs and the enrichment regularity indicate that the tectonic evolution controls oil reservoir adjusting direction, old oil reservoir migrates to the north-east direction. Organic matter abundance distribution of hydrocarbon source rocks controls the oil accumulation. The area where the organic matter abundance is more than 1 percent has favorable conditions for oil accumulation. The favorable deposit belts control the enrichment of oil and the underwater distributary channel of deltaicfront subfacies are close to hydrocarbon sources, and have better sand body physical properties and a large thickness, making it a favorable site for the accumulation of petroleum. The dynamic reduction of fluid controls the migration direction of petroleum in reservoring time. The bigger the dynamic reduction of fluid is, the more petroleum will be accumulated. The fracture serves as the migration channels for the hydrocarbon enrichment, and the porosity increasing caused by the fracture will further affect the hydrocarbon enrichment.",

Depositional microfacies belts controlled reservoir by sand body types and characteristics of properties. Reservoir performances of sandbodies show significant difference in different depositional microfacies. Porosity and permeability of subaqueous distribution channel sandbodies in delta-front is the highest in related sandbodies, and interdistributary bayisthe worst by small granularity, more matrix, strong mechanical compaction prevented flowing of late dissolution fluid. The strong mechanical compaction, pressure-solution and cementation of authogenetic minerals reduced reservoir performances of sandstones.

        "abstract": "Since the Late Paleozoic,the four large-sized basins(i.e.Ordos,Sichuan,Junggar and Tarim)in central-western China have experienced a similar evolution process from cratonic depression to intra-continental depression and finally to foreland(pseudo-foreland)basin,and their deposition features in thick clastic rocks.Hydrocarbon source rocks were widely developed in the intra-continental depressions,while thick high-quality source rocks were deposited in the pseudo-foreland basins,providing favorable basis for hydrocarbon accumulation in the clastic strata in the four basins.There are three types(inner-sourcing,out-sourcing and hybrid-sourcing)and six subtypes of petroleum accumulation systems.The inner-sourcing petroleum accumulation system is the major target for large-and medium-sized oil/gas reservoirs.For the inner-sourcing systems in the four basins,their oil and gas distribution has features of oil in upper part and gas in lower part as well as more gas to the south,their hydrocarbon accumulation were developed early in the north and late in the south.The temporal and spatial combination of source rock and reservoir is the major factor controlling hydrocarbon accumulation and enrichment.Slope zone and piedmont thrust belt are play fairways for these inner-sourcing systems.The distribution of the out-sourcing and inner-sourcing system are significantly complimentary,so greatly broadening the area and horizons for petroleum exploration in the clastic strata.The out-sourcing systems are distributed mainly in the south parts in the four basins.Hydrocarbon resource condition of marine strata and vertical migration pathways are major factors controlling hydrocarbon accumulation and enrichment in the out-sourcing systems.The paleo-uplift zones of marine strata and the Meso-Cenozoic faults zones are the play fairways for petroleum exploration in the out-sourcing system.",

METHODS: The animal model was established with 6 puberty female rhesus, which were randomly divided into experimental group (wore Class \u2162 Twin-block magnet appliance, each 2 rhesus for 3 and 6 months respectively) and control group(did not wear any appliance, each 1 rhesus for 3 and 6 months respectively ). The specimens were stained by hematoxylin and eosin, and image analysis system (IAS) was used in the quantatitive study of sutures width and cell density. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed, and LSD analysis was used when interclass significance was found. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, different changes were shown in different sutures.New bone formation was observed in all experimental animal. There was no significance difference between palatomaxillary suture and pterygomaxillary suture in cellular density(P>0.05). Zygomaticotemporal suture showed no difference between 3-month experimental group and control group;however, 6-month experimental group was significantly higher than 3-month experimental group (P<0.01).For frontomaxillary suture, 3-month experimental group was significantly higher than the control group, and 6-month experimental group was significantly higher than later one(P<0.01).Zygomaticomaxillary suture in the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group(P<0.01);meanwhile, 3-month experimental group was significantly higher than 6-month experimental group(P<0.05). Furthermore, the width of sutures were different in these groups. Palatomaxillary suture became significant narrower in 3-month experimental group(P<0.01),but zygomaticotemporal suture became significant wider(P<0.01). The width of sutures restored at 6th month(P>0.05). The width of pterygomaxillary suture was not different between 3-month experimental group and the control group(P>0.05),but it became significant wider in 6-month experimental group(P<0.05). Frontomaxillary sutures of the experimental group were significantly narrower than the control group, and 6-month experimental group was significantly narrower than 3-month experimental group(P<0.01).For zygomaticomaxillary suture, the experimental groups were significantly wider than the control group;meanwhile, there was no difference between the experimental groups. CONCLUSION: Proper Class \u2162 orthopedic force can promote the physiological remodling of maxillary sutures. Supported by Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (Grant No.2002C0023R).",

The early effects of cyclic uniaxial compressive stress on the protein profile of the rat mandibular condylar chondrocytes were examined by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS).The results showed that the protein profile of the condylar chondrocyte did not change statistically in 2000 microstrain group. In 4000 microstrain group, the protein profile of the condylar chondrocyte was changed. Three new proteins appeared. Five proteins disappeared. Twenty-two proteins were down-regulated and 7 proteins were up-regulated (P < 0.05). The eight different protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. It included cytoskeleton protein (gamma-actin and vimentin), glycometabolism protein (alpha enolase and stress-70 protein) and signal transduction protein (Raf kinase inhibited protein, RKLP).There were significant alternations of the protein profile in the rat condylar chondrocyte after the 4000 microstrain cyclic uniaxial compressive stress loading for 60 min. These different proteins might take part in the early response to the cyclic uniaxial compressive stress.",

        "abstract": "Objective Stress stimulation is closely related with the growth of the condyle,one of the growth sites of the mandible. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of condylar neck osteotomy on the growth of the condyle in the rat model.Methods Seventy-two 4-week-old SD rats were equally randomized to an osteotomy,a sham-operation and a blank control group,Models of unilateral condylar process osteotomy were established using special blood vessel forceps. All of the rats were killed at 1,3,5 and 9weeks after operation for observing the imageological,histological and anatomical changes in the condylar process, and detecting the expression of the connective tissue growth factor( CTGF) associated with condylar growth and that of type-X collagen( ColX) in the condylar cartilage. Results The condylar process on the operation side showed compensatory enlargement at 1 week after unilateral condylar osteotomy,and the growth of the mandible was inhibited at 1,3,5 and9 weeks. The length and height of the mandible and the height of the mandibular ascending ramus in the non-osteotomy were significantly increased,resulting in the asymmetry of the mandible. HE staining revealed a compensatory enlargement in the total thickness of the condylar cartilage on the osteotomy side at 1 week,which then became thinner. Quantitative analysis showed a significant increase in the expression of CTGF at 1,3 and 5 weeks as well as in that of Col X at 1 week on the operation side in the osteotomy group as compared with the sham-operation and a blank control groups. Conclusion This rat model of condylar neck osteotomy has obvious feasibility and repeatability. Unilateral condylar neck osteotomy produces a series of physical responses from the mandible and condyle,affects their growth and results in their asymmetry. It also affects the expressions of CTGF and Col X in the condylar cartilage.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effects of the cyclic uniaxial compressive stress on RKIP and its mRNA in the rat condylar chondrocytes. Methods:The third-passage chondrocytes were harvested from the mandibular condyles of 2-day-old rats, and a cellular compressive stress device (self-made four-point bending system. Patent No: 01129166.4 & 01256849.x) was used to apply stress on cells at 4 000 \u03bcstrain ( 0.5 Hz frequency) for 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min. The effects of the cyclic uniaxial compressive stress on RKIP and its mRNA in the rat mandibular condylar chondrocytes were examined by REAL-TIME PCR and Western blot. Results:The results showed that the expression of RKIP and its mRNA changed obviously with 4 000 \u03bcstrain compressive stress loading, there are reverse tendency in the expression between RKIP and its mRNA. RKIP mRNA significantly increased at 30min (P<0.001), to the peak at 60 min, then quickly decreased at 120 min. RKIP significantly decreased from 30 min to 120 min, then recovered at 240 min. Conclusion:With the 4 000 \u03bcstrain compressive stress stimulating, RKIP and its mRNA do different response under the compressive stress, but the expression of RKIP was influenced by RKIP mRNA. RKIP may play an important role in early-response to mechanical stimulation in condylar chondrocytes.",

The MCC was dyed by immunohisto-chemical method. The changes of the expression of collagen type I , II , III and proteoglycan (PG) were evaluated by a pathologic portraits analytic system.The static compressive stress with a magnitude from 12 to 24 kPa can enforce the expression of collagen type I , II, III and PG of MCC. However, the decrease of expression of collagen type I and PG of MCC was detected when exerted by the static compressive stress with a magnitude from 24 kPa to 36 kPa.The static stress of proper magnitude can make MCC more differentiate. However, the static stress of over-magnitude may make the biological characteristics of MCC weaken and express some characteristics of dedifferentiation.",

Monkeys in the test groups were TMAIII while the control groups did not. Histological method (HE staining) and in situ hybridization were employed in this study.1. The histological results showed that, compared with the control group, the anterior part of the condyle became thicker while the median part and the posterior part became thinner in 3 months group. However, in 6 months group, the change was similar to 3 months group. 2. The results of in situ hybridization showed that, in control group, TGF-beta 1 mRNA mildly expressed in the anterior part of the condyle while extensively in the median and posterior parts. In 3 months group, TGF-beta 1 mRNA expressed in all parts of condyle; the most intensive expression was in the anterior part. Compared with 3 months group, the expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA decreased in 6 months group, but the expression in anterior part was stronger than in median and posterior parts.Under Class III Orthopedic therapy, TGF-beta 1 mRNA probably participated in the endochrondral bone remodeling in the condyle, and the expression was closely related to loading time. In 3 months group, the expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA was stronger than that in 6 months group. It was inferred that the remodeling of endochrondral bone was more active in 3 months group.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the study is to detect the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA in the maxillary sutures of puberty rhesus during different periods of the loading of intermaxillary class III orthopedic force.The animal model was established with 6 puberty female rhesus, which were randomly divided into experimental group (wearing class III twin-block magnet appliance, each 2 rhesus for 3 and 6 month respectively) and control group (not wearing any appliance, each 1 rhesus for 3 and 6 month respectively). Tissue sections were obtained perpendicular to the sutures. In situ hybridization was used to the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA, and the expression intensity was measured and statistics was performed by SPSS 11.0.There were no statistic differences of cellular density between palatomaxillary suture in vertical group and pterygomaxillary suture in horizontal group, but statistic differences were found between other groups. The expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA was detected in the control group, but the expression intensity was obviously increased after the load of intermaxillary class III orthopedic force. Statistically significant differences were found among all groups except the six months experimental group and control group of temporozygomatic sutures and pterygomaxillary sutures. Experimental groups were more intensive than the control group and three months group was more intensive than the six months group.The active tissue remodeling happened in the circummaxillary sutures by the effect of class III intermaxillary orthopedic force. Cell proliferation, extracellular matrix synthesis and bone formation were accelerated. During the different remodeling periods, the expression intensities were different, which may be related to the different force loading manners, the different reaction of sutures to the orthopedic force and the different biological function of TGF-beta1 in the different periods.",

Effects of tin (Sn) doping and its content  x  on their structure, phase transition behavior, and electrical properties were investigated. Analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns and Rietveld refinement results confirmed the crystal structures of different phases and also compositional driven phase transitions. The results indicated that with the increase in the value of  x , orthorhombic phase was transformed into distorted tetragonal phase through rhombohedral phase. Ceramics exhibited the orthorhombic\u2013rhombohedral phase coexistence for 0.10\u00a0\u2264\u00a0 x \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.16, and orthorhombic\u2013rhombohedral\u2013distorted tetragonal multiphase coexistence for  x \u00a0=\u00a00.18. Although the orthorhombic antiferroelectric (AFE) phase was the major phase, no double hysteresis loops were detected through electrical hysteresis loop measurements because the electric field-induced AFE to ferroelectric (FE) phase transition occurred under the applied electric field, and the induced FE phase could not reverse back to AFE state after the removal of electric field. However, the trace of AFE behavior could be observed at a lower testing electric field. Moreover, increasing Sn content led to linear increment in phase transition temperature of FE RL -FE RH , up to 98.7\u00a0\u00b0C for  x \u00a0=\u00a00.18.",

However, the widespread application of dielectrics remains limited by their low energy density. In this work, lead-free single-phase relaxor (1\u2009\u2212\u2009x)Ba0.55Sr0.45TiO3-xBiMg2/3Nb1/3O3 [(1\u2009\u2212\u2009x)BST-xBMN] (x\u2009=\u20090, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.10) bulk ceramics were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction process. The dielectric properties, the relaxor behavior, and the energy storage properties were explored in detail. With increasing BMN content, the observed increase in activation energy (Ea) and the decrease in freezing temperature (Tf) indicate that the coupling between polar nano-regions (PNRs) gradually weakened, leading to the decrease in remanent polarization (Pr) and the increase in energy storage efficiency (\u03b7).

        "abstract": "Silver niobate (AgNbO3) is considered as one of the most promising lead-free replacements for lead-containing antiferroelectric (AFE) ceramics, and has been drawing progressively more attention because of its relatively high energy storage density. However, weak ferroelectricity in pure AgNbO3 exerts a negative impact on the energy storage performance, thus impeding the application of AgNbO3-based ceramics in high-power systems. In this study, an A-site doping strategy was employed to suppress the ferroelectric distortion and boost the AFE distortion of AgNbO3, based on local chemical pressure tailoring. An ultrahigh recoverable energy density (Wrec) of 4.5 J cm\u22123 was achieved in Ag0.88Gd0.04NbO3 ceramics, which is superior to that of other reported lead-free systems. The enhancement of energy storage performance is ascribed to two reasons: first, antiferroelectricity could be boosted by smaller ions and suitable vacancies on A-sites, evidenced by X-ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, and selected-area electron diffraction measurements. Moreover, the decreasing freezing temperature (Tf) and the increasing forward switching field (EF) as well as backward switching field (EA) with the increment of the gadolinium (Gd) content also confirmed the enhanced antiferroelectricity in Gd-doped AgNbO3 ceramics. Second, the introduction of Gd2O3 could effectively decrease the grain size and increase the dielectric breakdown strength (DBS = 290 kV cm\u22121). The performance due to local chemical pressure tailoring makes Gd-doped AgNbO3 materials the most promising energy storage lead-free ceramics for dielectric energy storage capacitors.",

        "abstract": "AgNbO3 is considered as one of the most promising alternatives for lead-containing antiferroelectric (AFE) ceramics, and has been drawing progressively more attention. The AFE/ferroelectric (FE) phase-boundary design based on AgNbO3 is very attractive and is a promising means to develop lead-free high-performance pyroelectric materials. In the present study, compounds with a high tolerance factor and high average electronegativity difference and LiNbO3-type composition were proposed as being able to stabilize the FE phase of AgNbO3. Ceramics with the composition (1 \u2212 x)AgNbO3\u2013xLiTaO3 (ANLT) (x = 0\u20130.10) were designed and fabricated using the conventional solid-state method for pyroelectric applications. The effects of the LiTaO3 content, temperature, and electric field on the phase-transition behavior of the ANLT system were investigated systematically. Based on our results, a composition\u2013temperature phase diagram of the ANLT system was proposed, confirming the existence of the AFE/FE phase boundary. The depolarization and pyroelectric properties of the ANLT system were also studied. It was found that the x = 0.05 composition at the AFE/FE phase boundary had a large room-temperature pyroelectric coefficient (3.68 10\u22128 C cm\u22122 K\u22121) and exhibited excellent figures of merit for infrared detectors due to its low relative permittivity (252 at 1 kHz). Moreover, an ultrahigh pyroelectric energy density (1.4 J cm\u22123) was harvested using an Olsen cycle for the x = 0.5 composition, which was several times larger than that of other ceramic systems reported recently. These results suggest the ANLT ceramic would be an attractive multifunctional material for applications in infrared detectors and energy harvesting.",

        "abstract": "NaNbO3 (NN) is generally considered as one of the most promising lead-free antiferroelectric (AFE) perovskite materials with the advantages of low cost, low density and nontoxicity. However, the metastable ferroelectric phase causes a large remanent polarization (Pr) at room temperature, seriously hindering the achievement of excellent energy storage properties. Although via the strategy of lowering the radius of B-site ions and polarizability, a number of AFE NaNbO3-based solid solutions with double polarization\u2013electric field loops are successfully constructed, the hysteresis losses are still too large and the Pr value cannot be reduced to near zero. In this study, Bi(Mg2/3Nb1/3)NbO3 (BMN) was chosen to partially substitute the pure NaNbO3 with the intention of enhancing antiferroelectricity and constructing a local random field simultaneously. These short-range interactions effectively suppress the hysteresis loss and Pr, and slim hysteresis loops were observed in the NN\u2013BMN ceramics. A high charged energy density (3.4 J cm\u22123) and recoverable energy storage density (2.8 J cm\u22123) with high efficiency (82%) were achieved under 300 kV cm\u22121 for NN\u20130.10BMN. Superior stabilities and underdamped discharge abilities were also achieved for NN\u20130.15BMN with a slightly smaller recoverable energy storage density (2.4 J cm\u22123) but even higher efficiency (90%).

        "abstract": "Despite recent advances in the stimuli-responsive composites for oil-storage and smart-lubrication, achieving the high oil-storage and recyclable smart-lubrication remains a challenge. Herein, a novel cobweb-like structural system consisting of oil-warehouse and transportation system was designed and prepared, and it shows high capacity of oil-storage and recyclable smart-lubrication. Hollow SiO2 microspheres grated of KH550 and porous polyimide (PPI) were used as oil-warehouse and pipeline, respectively, to build the smart system. Due to the novel structure, the composites can keep both high oil-content and oil-retention. Applying stimuli on materials resulted in lubricants releasing on the contact surface which can reduce the friction and wear during sliding. Whereas removing stimuli, the capillary force induced the sucking back of lubricant into the interior of composites through interconnected small pores of PPI. Based on high oil-storage and stimuli-responsive performance, the composites can be used for recyclable smart-lubrication. The composites showed remarkable lubricating properties (COF 0.056 and Ws 3.55\u00d710-7 mm3N-1m-1) when the content of KHSM was 1.5 wt.% by subjecting it to macroscopic pin-on-disc friction tests. Therefore, cobweb-like structural composites with oil-warehouse and transportation system hold the promise for formulating of high oil-storage and recyclable smart-lubrication.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The two-dimensional (2D) material of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) has shown great promise for tribo-materials due to special molecular structure. In this work, we report an effective approach to enhance anti-wear of thermosetting polyimide (TPI) by filling with g-C 3 N 4  under high temperature. TPI composite (TPT-1) and g-C 3 N 4  were firstly prepared. Then, friction and wear behavior of TPT-1 was studied and comparatively evaluated with neat resin from room temperature to 350\u202f\u00b0C. As a result, the wear resistance of TPI was able to significantly improve and an much lower wear rate (7.29\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 \u22127 \u202fmm 3 /N\u202fm) was achieved at 350\u202f\u00b0C. Moreover, mechanism of friction and wear was demonstrated that transfer film formed by introducing g-C 3 N 4  with high E-modulus and hardness could effectively share the load with TPI and prevent from further abrasion of resin in contact surfaces. This work could help researchers to design a new TPI tribo-material used at high temperature.",

By using Voronoi diagrams, the reverse nearest neighbors of a given point could be queried without computing the nearest neighbors every time. In each query, only a few data points were filtered out to perform a judgment about the reverse nearest neighbor. An algorithm and judgment method are given for instances of changes to the reverse nearest neighbor of the given query points caused by the addition or deletion of data points from the dataset. To more easily search for these points in a database, corresponding database storage structures were designed. Comparative analysis shows that this method is suitable for reverse nearest neighbor queries of data points on planar surfaces and complex curved surfaces.",

The performances of the two methods are analyzed with dynamic dense dataset and dynamic sparse dataset. The result shows that the two methods can handle NN query of the data objects with the different properties on spherical surface efficiently.",

        "abstract": "Aldol condensation reactions between furfural and acetone can be used to produce liquid fuel intermediates. It was found that tin-containing zeolites with MFI (Sn-MFI) and BEA* (Sn-Beta) framework structures are effective for C\u2013C bond formation via the aldol condensation reactions between furfural and acetone. Aldol condensation between furfural and acetone produced two main products, 4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one (FAc) and 1,5-di-2-furanyl-1,4-pentadien-3-one (F2Ac). Although both these catalysts were active for the aldol condensation reactions, different selectivities to aldol products were observed over Sn-MFI and Sn-Beta. FAc and F2Ac were formed over the Sn-Beta catalyst with selectivities to FAc of 40% and F2Ac of 22%, respectively. In contrast, only FAc was produced over Sn-MFI. The variation in selectivity is likely due to different pore geometries of Sn-Beta and Sn-MFI, suggesting that Sn-MFI exhibits shape selectivity for aldol condensation between furfural and acetone. In addition, it was found that the addition of water to the reaction system can also affect the product selectivity, leading to the aldol product exclusively being FAc over Sn-Beta.",

        "abstract": "The lignin-first biorefinery method appears to be an attractive approach to produce phenolic chemicals. Herein, corn stover was employed for the production of phenolic monomers using an unsupported non-noble MoS2 catalyst. The yield of phenolic monomers was enhanced from 6.65% to 18.47% with MoS2 at 250 \u00b0C and about 75% lignin was degraded with more than 90% glucan reserved in the solid residues. The Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H\u201313C HSQC-NMR) characterization suggested that the cleavage of the \u03b2-O-4, \u03b3-ester and benzyl ether linkages were enhanced, promoting the delignification and the depolymerization of lignin. The catalyst performance was relatively effective with 14.30% phenolic monomer yield after the fifth run. The effects of the reaction temperature, the initial hydrogen pressure, the dosage of catalyst, and the reaction time were investigated. The model reactions were also proposed for the potential mechanism study. This work provides some basic information for the improvement of the graminaceous plant lignin-first process with a non-noble metal catalyst.",

GVL (\u03b3-valerolactone)\u2013water and ethanol\u2013water solvent systems were evaluated in the dehydration reaction of glucose into HMF and EMF, respectively. Water content and dosage of AlCl3\u00b76H2O were examined in the conversion of glucose into HMF, and some valuable chlorides (FeCl3\u00b76H2O, NiCl2\u00b76H2O, CrCl3\u00b76H2O etc.) were also used in contrast with AlCl3\u00b76H2O. Some different organic solvents were added to the ethanol\u2013water system to explore whether it would be beneficial to the generation of EMF. A high yield of HMF (60.7%) was obtained at 140 \u00b0C within 60 min in GVL\u2013water (10\u2006:\u20061) solvent system, and total yield 42.1% of EMF and HMF (30.6% EMF, 11.5% HMF) was achieved at 150 \u00b0C after 30 min in an ethanol\u2013water (9\u2006:\u20061) solvent system.",

        "abstract": "The solid, super, acid catalyst S2O82\u2212/ZrO2\u2013TiO2\u2013SiO2, which has both a strong Bronsted acid and Lewis acid, was prepared and applied in lignin depolymerization. The results indicate that S2O82\u2212/ZrO2\u2013TiO2\u2013SiO2 is an effective catalyst for lignin depolymerisation since the liquid product was almost completely dissolved in ethyl acetate, indicating that it was comprised of mostly oligomeric lignin degradation products. The effect of hydrogenation co-catalysts (Pd/C, Pt/C and Ru/C, Rh/C) were also studied and found to improve the yield of aromatic compounds and the petroleum ether soluble fraction, which are mostly monomeric and dimeric products. The resulting yields of aromatic compounds and petroleum ether soluble products were 14.8% and 46%, respectively, when S2O82\u2212/ZrO2\u2013TiO2\u2013SiO2 and Pt/C mixed catalyst was used at 310 \u00b0C for 24 hours. These results show that the use of a combination Bronsted and Lewis acid catalyst in combination with a hydrogenation catalyst (S2O82\u2212/ZrO2\u2013TiO2\u2013SiO2 together with a noble metal catalyst) opens a practical route for efficient lignin depolymerization.",

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements verified that the binary mixture exhibited lower glass transition temperature than either of the pure room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). Moreover, the binary mixture gave rise to higher conductivity than the neat RTILs at lower temperature range. In order to study its capacitive performance in supercapacitors, simulations were performed of the mixture, and the neat RTILs used as electrolytes near an onion-like carbon (OLC) electrode at varying temperatures. The differential capacitance exhibited independence of the electrical potential applied for three electrolytes, which is in agreement with previous work on OLC electrodes in a different RTILs. Positive temperature dependence of the differential capacitance was observed, and it was dominated by the electrical double layer (EDL) thickness, which is for the first time substantiated in MD simulation.

        "abstract": "Concern about the toxicity of engineered nanoparticles, such as the prototypical nanomaterial C60 fullerene, continues to grow. While, evidence continues to mount that C60 and its derivatives may pose health hazards, the specific molecular interactions of these particles with biological macromolecules require further investigation. In this article, we report combined experimental and theoretical studies on the interaction of one of the most prevalent proteins in the human body, human serum albumin (HSA), with C60 in an aqueous environment. The C60\u2013HSA interaction was probed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand C60-driven changes in the structure of HSA in solution. The CD spectroscopy demonstrates that the secondary structure of the protein decreases in \u03b1-helical content in response to the presence of C60 (0.68\u00a0nm in diameter). Similarly, C60 produces subtle changes in the solution conformation of HSA (an 8.0\u00a0nm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.8\u00a0nm protein), as evidenced by the SANS data and MD simulations, but the data do not indicate that C60 changes the oligomerization state of the protein, such as by inducing aggregation. The results demonstrate that the interaction is not highly disruptive to the protein in a manner that would prevent it from performing its physiological function.",

A strong correlation was observed between the interfacial RTIL structure and the step thickness in electrode surface as well as the ion size. Specifically, when the step thickness is commensurate with ion size, the interfacial layering of cation/anion is more evident; whereas, the layering tends to be less defined when the step thickness is close to the half of ion size. Furthermore, two-dimensional microstructure of ion layers exhibits different patterns and alignments of counterion/co-ion lattice at neutral and charged electrodes. As the cation/anion layering could impose considerable effects on ion diffusion, the detailed information of interfacial RTILs at stepped graphite presented here would help to understand the molecular mechanism of RTIL-electrode interfaces in supercapacitors. \u00a9 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 61: 3022\u20133028, 2015",

Here, we report that a water droplet dropping onto a piece of porous carbon film can spontaneously generate electricity under ambient conditions. Twelve 5-\u03bcL water droplets can generate a voltage up to 5.2\u202fV and illuminate a liquid crystal display. The voltage can be controlled by modulating the direction of the droplet infiltration, the zeta potential of the porous carbon, and the ion concentration. The results demonstrate that a hydrophilic porous carbon film with water droplets may function as a cost-effective electricity generator for harvesting energy from natural resources.",

        "abstract": "Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are an emerging class of electrolytes for supercapacitors. In this work, we investigate the effects of different supercapacitor models and anion shape on the electrical double layers (EDLs) of two different RTILs: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([Emim][Tf\u2082N]) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium 2-(cyano)pyrrolide ([Emim][CNPyr]) by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The EDL microstructure is represented by number densities of cations and anions, and the potential drop near neutral and charged electrodes reveal that the supercapacitor model with a single electrode has the same EDL structure as the model with two opposite electrodes. Nevertheless, the employment of the one-electrode model without tuning the bulk density of RTILs is more time-saving in contrast to the two-electrode one. With the one-electrode model, our simulation demonstrated that the shapes of anions significantly imposed effects on the microstructure of EDLs. The EDL differential capacitance vs. potential (C-V) curves of [Emim][CNPyr] electrolyte exhibit higher differential capacitance at positive potentials. The modeling study provides microscopic insight into the EDLs structure of RTILs with different anion shapes.",

        "abstract": "The effects of dication symmetry on the structure and capacitance of the electrical double layers (EDLs) of dicationic ionic liquids (DILs) near graphene electrodes were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in this work. Symmetrical 1-hexyl-3-dimethylimidazolium di[bis(trifluoromethyl)imide]([C6(mim)2](Tf2N)2) and asymmetrical 1-(1-trimethylammonium-yl-hexyl)-3-methylimidazolium di[bis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl)-imide] ([C6(tma)(mim)](Tf2N)2) were both employed. Radial distribution function (RDF) analysis of the two DILs revealed a shorter distance between the cation\u2013anion pairs in symmetrical [C6(mim)2](Tf2N)2), which was attributed to the closely packed imidazolium ring-anion pairs. In contrast, the trimethylammonium head groups and anions exhibit a relatively longer distance, but a stronger correlation in asymmetrical [C6(tma)(mim)](Tf2N)2. In addition, it was illustrated that more symmetrical DIL ions in EDLs are distributed near graphite electrodes and exhibit closer distances to the electrode, which is most probably due to the parallel orientation of imidazolium rings, reducing the distance between the cation and the graphene. In contrast, asymmetrical DILs, with one trimethylammonium head group and one imidazolium ring in the dications, are loosely packed due to their tilting orientation near graphene surfaces. However, the capacitance\u2013potential (C\u2013V) curves of the two DILs are almost the same, regardless of the opposite sign of potential of zero charge (PZC), indicating the insignificant influence of dication symmetry on the capacitance of DIL-based supercapacitors.",

Four types of AAILs, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium glycine ([EMIM][GLY]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium serine ([EMIM][SER]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium valine ([EMIM][VAL]) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium phenylalanine ([EMIM][PHE]), with different amino acid anions were selected as electrolytes for supercapacitors. The number density profiles and ion orientation at varying surface charge densities were delineated to exploit the microstructure of EDLs for different AAILs. As a result, similar EDL structures of cations near a negative graphene electrode were observed, whereas the EDLs at positively charged electrodes displayed dependence on amino acid anions. AAILs composed of the common cation [EMIM]+ and dissimilar amino acid anions exhibit similar differential capacitance\u2013electrical potential (C\u2013V) curves and comparable capacitance to conventional ionic liquids.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Water in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) could impose significant effects on their interfacial properties at a charged surface. Although the interfaces between RTILs and mica surfaces exhibit rich microstructure, the influence of water content on such interfaces is little understood, in particular, considering the fact that RTILs are always associated with water due to their hygroscopicity. In this work, we studied how different types of RTILs and different amounts of water molecules affect the RTIL-mica interfaces, especially the water distribution at mica surfaces, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. MD results showed that (1) there is more water and a thicker water layer adsorbed on the mica surface as the water content increases, and correspondingly the average location of K +  ions is farther from mica surface; (2) more water accumulated at the interface with the hydrophobic [Emim][TFSI] than in case of the hydrophilic [Emim][BF 4 ] due to the respective RTIL hydrophobicity and ion size. A similar trend was also observed in the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules. Moreover, the 2D number density map of adsorbed water revealed that the high-density areas of water seem to be related to K +  ions and silicon/aluminum atoms on mica surface. These results are of great importance to understand the effects of hydrophobicity/hydrophicility of RTIL and water on the interfacial microstructure at electrified surfaces.",

To avoid the limitations of traditional solid-state thermoelectric materials, such as frangibility and complex fabrication processes, we fabricated two types of thermogalvanic gel electrolytes with positive and negative thermo-electrochemical Seebeck coefficients, respectively, which correspond to the n-type and p-type elements of a conventional thermoelectric generator. Such gel electrolytes exhibit not only moderate thermoelectric performance but also good mechanical properties. Based on these electrolytes, a flexible and wearable thermocell was designed with an output voltage approaching 1\u2005V by utilizing body heat.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The mixed linker metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) consisting of a variety of organic linkers functionalized by multiple functional groups exhibit better performance in carbon capture due to the increased surface heterogeneity. In order to explore the influence of the framework topology and mixed functionalities on the carbon capture performance, in this work, Zr-MOFs in three topologies ( csq ,  ftw ,  scu ) with each composed by one of the three types of linkers of different lengths were constructed, which were then functionalized by three types of functional groups ( F,  NH 2 ,  OCH 3 ), respectively. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were used to investigate CO 2  adsorption performance of all created MOFs. We revealed that among the parent MOFs consisted of identical building blocks but in different topologies,  ftw -MOFs exhibit the highest CO 2  working capacity and CO 2 /N 2  selectivity due to the strong affinity towards CO 2 . Moreover, the CO 2  adsorption performance of  ftw- MOFs shows obvious dependence on the pore size, consistent with their host-adsorbate interaction energy, which is not the fact for  csq- MOFs and  scu- MOFs. The enhanced CO 2  adsorption performance upon functionalization of MOFs displays pore-size dependence as well, especially for  NH 2  functionalized frameworks in  csq  and  scu , which is mostly attributed to the enhanced host-adsorbate Coulombic interaction. The proposed effects of the topology, the pore size and the functional group on CO 2  adsorption performance of MOFs obtained in this study may provide meaningful insight into the rational design of high-performing MOFs for carbon capture by tuning the topology, pore size and functionality of frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Adsorption-driven heat pumps (AHPs) based on metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have been garnering rapidly growing research interests due to their outstanding adsorption performance. However, the quick discovery of potential MOF candidates for cooling/heating from a large number of MOFs is still a hurdle for developing highly efficient AHPs. In this work, we performed high-throughput computational screening based on grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to assess the adsorption cooling efficiencies (i.e., coefficient of performance for cooling, COPC) of 1527 computationally ready experimental (CoRE) MOF structures using ethanol as the working fluid. On the basis of the obtained correlations between the MOF structures, properties, adsorption performance, and adsorption cooling efficiency, we found that the pore size of 10\u201315 A, rather than larger pores, was favorable for both ethanol working capacity (\u0394W) and COPC. Moreover, both \u0394W and averaged enthalpy of adsorption (\u3008\u0394adsH\u3009) played dominant roles in determining the COPC value. Principle component analysis (PCA) and decision tree (DT) modeling revealed that there is interplay between the pore size, \u0394W, and \u3008\u0394adsH\u3009. For MOFs with low working capacities (\u0394W \u2264 0.27 g g\u22121), large pore size is favorable for COPC; for MOFs with high working capacities (\u0394W u003e 0.27 g g\u22121), low \u3008\u0394adsH\u3009 is more important for COPC. Furthermore, the top-performing MOFs exhibited stepwise adsorption and low Henryu0027s constant, both of which are beneficial for COPC. In addition, we revealed that the incommensurate total interaction energy of MOF\u2013ethanol pairs between the preheating and desorption processes will benefit \u0394W, thereby eventually leading to improved COPC, and vice versa. Finally, the evolutionary tendency of screening validated our screening strategy and structure\u2013property relationship, which was also supported by the cooling efficiency predicted by the mathematical model using experimentally measured isotherms.",

With the shifting of the focus of geological survey from merely \"resources\" to \"both resources and environment\", organic analysis has played a more and more important role in the investigation of water resources, soil resources and environmental ecology. With the support of China\u2019s Geological Survey Project and the promotion of the IPEUW (Investigation and Pollution Evaluation of Underground Water in China), the National Research Center of Geoanalysis (NRCGA) has successfully set up a series of organic matter analytical methods since 2003, which have been widely used by other geological labs. Currently professional organic compound analytical methods are being widely employed in geological survey and research. 37 kinds of organic targets can be tested, and the means include sampling, target analysis and quality control. The underground water analysis team has carried out analyses of up to 20,000 samples from IPEUW. In 2008, the analytical team led by Prof. Rao Zhu took part in drafting and verifying NationalRegulations on Wenchuan Water Quality (water quality determination of putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, spermine and histamine\u2015high performance liquid chromatography method, GB/T 21970-2008), Melamine Measurement (rapid determination of melamine in raw milk\u2015high performance chromatography method, GB/T 22400-2008), which evidenced the effectiveness of this analytical method and its value to society.",

The genomic DNA was isolated from 170 patients with gastric carcinoma and 140 age- and sex-matched control subjects. The frequencies of C677T genotype were: CC (47.9%), CT (40%), CT (12.1%) in control group and CC (35.9%), CT (45.9%), TT (18.2%) in gastric carcinoma group, respectively. The individuals with 677CT + TT or 677TT genotypes had a 1.67-fold (95% CI: 1.06-2.64) or 2.67-fold (95% CI: 1.382-5.341) increased risk of developing gastric carcinoma compared with those carrying 677CC genotype. The genotype of MTHFR gene A1298C allele was not significantly different between the two groups. We found that a joint effect exits between the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphism on the risk of gastric carcinoma.

        "abstract": "Magnetic silica nanocomposites (magnetic nanoparticles core coated by silica shell) have the wide promising applications in the biomedical field and usually been prepared based on the famous St\u00f6ber process. However, the flocculation of Fe 3O 4 nanoparticles easily occurs during the silica coating, which limits the amount of magnetic silica particles produced in the St\u00f6ber process. In this paper, PMMA/Fe 3O 4 nanoparticles were used in the St\u00f6ber process instead of the \"nude\" Fe 3O 4 nanoparticles. And coating Fe 3O 4 with PMMA polymer beforehand can prevent magnetic nanoparticles from the aggregation that usually comes from the increasing of ionic strength during the hydrolyzation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) by the steric hindrance. The results show that the critical concentration of magnetic nanoparticles can increase from 12 mg/L for \"nude\" Fe 3O 4 nanoparticles to 3 g/L for PMMA/Fe 3O 4 nanoparticles during the St\u00f6ber process. And before the deposition of silica shell, the surface of PMMA/Fe 3O 4 nanoparticles had to be further modified by hydrolyzing them in CH 3OH/NH 3 \u00b7 H 2O mixture solution, which provides the carboxyl groups on their surface to react further with the silanol groups of silicic acid.

The compact self-assembled monolayer is obtained when the self-assembling temperature is 303 K, the self-assembling time is 4 h and the concentration of APMDES is 3%. To detect albumin by means of the nanogold-promoted precipitation of silver with the optimal signal-to-noise ratio, the parameters to influence the detection current signals and the background current signals are investigated using anodic stripping voltammetry. The obtained optimal processing conditions are as follows: the gold labeling temperature is 298 K and the time is 30 min, the silver enhancement temperature is 303 K and the time is 8 min. Under the above conditions, different concentrations of BSA are detected by anodic stripping voltammetry. The results showed that the peak currents are linear to the concentration of albumin over the wide range from 0.5 to 0.05 ng/mL, and the detection limit is 0.02 ng/mL, the regress linear equation is I (microA)= 0.8254 + 1.4319 x C (ng/mL), R = 0.958, and the background current signals are smaller than 2.0 x 10(-7) A.",

        "abstract": "We combine molecular dynamics simulations and relative free energy calculation to investigate how single central base mismatch influence the conformation and stability of surface immobilized DNA. For comparison purpose, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on a central mismatched duplex and the corresponding perfectly matched duplex, respectively. Simulations have been conducted with the generalized Born model. The relative free energy differences of the two systems suggest the single base-pair mismatch may lower the stability of DNA as expectation. The result obtained from the structural analysis shows the average conformations of the two DNA duplexes resemble the B-form, which suggests the central base pair mismatch has little effect on the overall conformation of DNA. Furthermore, our result shows the fluctuation of the perfectly matched duplex is obviously larger than that of the central base pair mismatched duplex. This study gives us a new atomic-level insight into DNA probe-target interaction on the surface. The results presented here will also aid in the design of DNA microarrays for single nucleotide polymorphisms screening.",

PPCPE was fabricated by mixing polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres as the template, graphite powders as the filler, pyrrole as the precursor of polymer which actually acted as the paste. After the polymerization of pyrrole catalyzed by Fe3+, the template PMMA microspheres were removed to form PPCPE. The pore size were determined by SEM observations, their diameters were in the range from 2 to 5 microm, and the specific surface area of PPCPE was 42.76 m2/g by N2 adsorption at 77 K using the Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET) method. The hybridization reaction on the electrode was monitored by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) analysis using the method of gold nanoparticle-catalyzed silver enhancement. Compared with previous DNA sensors the attached DNA and complementary DNA detection sensitivity were dramatically increased. The experiments of ASV showed that the peak current of Ag at PPCPE were linear with the amount of complementary oligonucleotide ranging from 1 to 80 nM and 0.08 to 1 nM, the detection limit was as low as 0.05 nM.",

        "abstract": "A novel method was established through the detection of chemiluminescent signals of nucleic acid hybridization based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and PCR. 5' amino- modified specific probes were immobilized on the surface of silanized MNPs by Schiff reaction between amino and aldehyde group. The probes were used to capture the synthetic biotin-dUTP-labeled DNA fragments which were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then these complexes were bonded with streptavidin-modified alkaline phosphatase (SA-AP). Finally the chemiluminescent signals were detected by adding 3-(2'-spiroadamantane)- 4-methoxy -4-(3\"-phosphoryloxy) phenyl-1, 2-dioxetane (AMPPD) which was the substrate reagent of AP. The concentration of probes which were immobilized on the surface of MNPs was studied, how to reduce the adsorption of SA-AP on the surface of MNPs was also researched. It was shown that 12.5 pmol of probes were immobilized on 1 mg of MNPs. Aldehyde-MNPs modified with probes could adsorb SA-AP, affecting the sensitivity of chemiluminescene consequently. Reduction of aldehyde group by sodium borohydride and blocking the bare position of MNPs with bovine serum albumin (BSA) could decrease the background of chemiluminescence, and this method has good specificity in detection of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene.",

Although many methods and devices have been developed creatively and shown their efficiency in experiments, few of them are suitable for commercial applications routinely. Here, we design a wearable falling detector as a mobile terminal, and utilize the wireless technology to transfer and monitor the activity data of the host in a relatively small community. With the help of the accelerometer sensor and the Google Mapping service, information of the location and the activity data will be send to the remote server for the downstream processing. The experimental result has shown that SA (Sum-vector of all axes) value of 2.5 g is the threshold value to distinguish the falling from other activities. A three-stage detection algorithm was adopted to increase the accuracy of the real alarm, and the accuracy rate of our system was more than 95%. With the further improvement, the falling detecting device which is low-cost, accurate and user-friendly would become more and more common in everyday life. Language: en",

        "abstract": "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are a special kind of nanomaterials and widely used in biomedical technology applications. Currently they are popularly customized for disease detection and treatment, particularly as drug carriers in drug targeted delivery systems, as a therapeutic in hyperthermia (treating tumors with heat), and as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to their biocompatibility and superparamagnetic properties, MNPs as next generation drug carriers have great attraction. Although the potential benefits of MNPs are considerable, any potential toxicity associated with these MNPs should be identified distinctly. The drug loading capability and the biomedical properties of MNPs generated by different surface coatings are the most sensitive parameters in toxicity. A lot of organic and inorganic materials are utilized as coating materials for surface functionalization and reducing toxicity of MNPs. pH or temperature sensitivity materials are widely used to manage drug loading and targeted release. In addition, MNPs can be controlled and directed to the desired pathological region by using external magnetic files (EMF). The realization of targeted drug delivery has decreased the dosage and improved the efficiency of drugs, which results in reduced side effects to normal tissues. This review discussed the possible organ toxicities of MNPs and their current advances as a drug delivery vehicle.",

With the help of self-assembly, seed-mediated growth and chemical reduction method, core-shell Fe3O4@SiO2@Au GMNPs were synthesized. Through modified streptavidin on the GMNPs surface, we obtained a bead chip which can capture the biotinylated probes. Then we designed MLPA probes which were tagged with biotin or Cy3 and target DNA on the basis of human APP gene sequence. The products from the thermostable DNA ligase induced ligation reactions and PCR amplifications were incubated with SA-GMNPs. After washing, magnetic separation, spotting, the fluorescent scanning results showed our method can be used for the relative quantitative analysis of the target DNA in the concentration range of 03004~0.5 \u00b5M.",

Then these magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were applied in the developed system of chemiluminescent magnetic enzyme-linked immunoassay. E. coli O157:H7 was sandwiched between rabbits anti-E. coli O157:H7 polyclonal antibody-coated magnetite nanoparticles (immunomagnetic nanoparticles or IMNPs) and mouse anti-E. coli O157:H7 monoclonal antibody (E. coli O157-McAb). Commercial alkaline phosphatase conjugated horse anti-mouse immunoglobulin (ALP-Ab) was used to bond with the monoclonal antibody, finally the chemiluminescent signals were detected by adding 3-(2\u2032-spiroadamantane)-4-methoxy-4-(3\u2033-phosphoryloxy)phenyl- 1,2-dioxetane (AMPPD) which was the substrate reagent of ALP. The specificity and sensitivity of this system for detecting E. coli O157:H7 were researched. The results indicated that this method was of good specificity when using E. coli Top 10F\u2032 and Vibrio cholera as negative controls.

The iC-GPC Assay is designed for use with the iC-System\u2122, which automates sample preparation, ARM-PCR, and microarray detection within a closed cassette. Herein, we determined the limit of detection for each of the iC-GPC Assay targets to be between 3.0 \u00d7 10-1.7 \u00d7 10 CFU/mL, well below clinically relevant bacterial levels for positive blood cultures. Additionally, we tested 106 strains for assay inclusivity and observed a target performance of 99.4%. 95 of 96 non-target organisms tested negative for cross-reactivity, thereby assuring a high level of assay specificity. Overall performance above 99% was observed for iC-GPC Assay reproducibility studies across multiple sites, operators and cassette lots. In conclusion, the iC-GPC Assay is capable of accurately and rapidly identifying bacterial species and resistance determinants present in blood cultures containing gram positive bacteria. Utilizing molecular diagnostics like the iC-GPC Assay will decrease time to treatment, healthcare costs, and BSI-related mortality.",

        "abstract": "To fulfill the increasing need for large-scale genetic research, a high-throughput and automated SNPs genotyping method based on gold magnetic nanoparticles (GMNPs) array and dual-color single base extension has been designed. After amplification of DNA templates, biotinylated extension primers were captured by streptavidin coated gold magnetic nanoparticle (SA-GMNPs). Next a solid-phase, dual-color single base extension (SBE) reaction with the specific biotinylated primer was performed directly on the surface of the GMNPs. Finally, a \"bead array\" was fabricated by spotting GMNPs with fluorophore on a clean glass slide, and the genotype of each sample was discriminated by scanning the \"bead array\". MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism of 320 individual samples were interrogated using this method, the signal/noise ratio for homozygous samples were over 12.33, while the signal/noise ratio for heterozygous samples was near 1. Compared with other dual-color hybridization based genotyping methods, the method described here gives a higher signal/noise ratio and SNP loci can be identified with a high level of confidence. This assay has the advantage of eliminating the need for background subtraction and direct analysis of the fluorescence values of the GMNPs to determine their genotypes without the necessary procedures for purification and complex reduction of PCR products. The application of this strategy to large-scale SNP studies simplifies the process, and reduces the labor required to produce highly sensitive results while improving the potential for automation.",

We developed a high throughput SNP detection system based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) separation and dual-color hybridization or single base extension. This system includes a magnetic separation unit for sample separation, three high precision robot arms for pipetting and microtiter plate transferring respectively, an accurate temperature control unit for PCR and DNA hybridization and a high accurate and sensitive optical signal detection unit for fluorescence detection. The cyclooxygenase-2 gene promoter region--65G > C polymorphism locus SNP genotyping experiment for 48 samples from the northern Jiangsu area has been done to verify that if this system can simplify manual operation of the researchers, save time and improve efficiency in SNP genotyping experiments. It can realize sample preparation, target sequence amplification, signal detection and data analysis automatically and can be used in clinical molecule diagnosis and high throughput fluorescence immunological detection and so on.",

Methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarrays are rapid and sensitive enough to detect very small quantities of microorganisms, however, the requirement for expensive equipments limits their application. In the present paper, we describe a method based on multiplex PCR and magnetic nanoparticles labelling for simultaneous detection of four major foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholera and Campylobacter jejuni. The process utilizes an oligonucleotide array onto which 5' biotinylated single strand PCR products were hybridized and visualized with streptavidin-coated magnetic nanoparticles (SA-MNPs), the signal from which could be detected by the naked eye, microscope or CCD camera. By employing SA-MNPs as visible labels, the microarray unambiguously distinguished all 4 pathogens with detection sensitivity up to 316 CFU/mL. Due to its high sensitivity, specificity and simple detection procedure, the magnetic bead assay provides a powerful tool for the detection and identification of foodborne pathogens in a modestly equipped laboratory.",

In this paper, the syntheses of two or three different alkyl-phenylboronic acids and the improvement on synthesis processes were studied with Grignard reagent method in detail. The influencing factors such as temperature, reaction time, reactant molar ratio were analyzed with the orthogonal experiment; optimized processes for the preparation of different alkyl-phenylboronic acids were thus obtained using different alkylborates as original materials. Based on the analysis of the experiment results, a \"one-pot\" method was proposed and checked to synthesize several different alkyl-phenylboronic acids. It was shown that 2,6-dimethylphenylboronic acid could be synthesized with \"one-pot\" method while para-alkyl-phenylboronic acid could not. An optimized process for the synthesis of 2,6-dimethylphenylboronic acid was obtained by investigating the influence of the boronation reagent, reactant proportion and solvent on the yield. Meanwhile, the preliminary synthesis of 2-ethylphenylboric acid was investigated with \"one-pot\" method too. Each product was identified by mass spectrum, 1HNMR, IR and HPLC.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to check if taurine, as an antioxidant or dietary supplement, can trap MDA (malondialdehyde) indirectly or directly and thereby prevents the formation of advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs) in vitro. Reaction between taurine with fatty acid, verified by detecting the formation and yield of MDA and taurine consumption, shows that taurine may trap reactive intermediates during lipid peroxidation. The direct reaction between taurine and MDA indicates that taurine reacts readily with MDA under supraphysiological conditions to form different products. A nonfluorescent enamine (product 1) and a lipofuscin-like fluorescent1,4-dihydropyridine (product 2) were obtained experimentally from reaction of equimolar of taurine with MDA and were detected by means of HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) separation for the reaction mixtures at ten minutes and 48 h. It was observed that the former was formed much faster than the latter. We suggest a mechanism for both the oxidation process of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the reaction of taurine and MDA. Taurine, as a potent inhibitor of the chemical modification of proteins, also greatly prevents the formation of lipofuscin-like fluorescence induced by the reaction of MDA with bovine serum albumin. The results indicate that the scavenging effects of taurine on reactive carbonyl compounds may play an important role in inhibiting the formation of ALEs and in protecting proteins against carbonyl stress. \u00a9 2011 American Scientific Publishers.",

The physical and chemical properties of PPCPE are discussed in detail, the results show that the specific surface area of PPCPE with pores ranging from 2 to 5 \u03bcm in diameter is 59.26 m2.g-1. The obtained PPCPE possesses excellent hydrophilic. It was demonstrated that PPCPE exhibites a high selectivity and sensitivity toward paracetamol in comparison with polypyrrole modified carbon paste electrode (PCPE), carbon nanotube modified carbon paste electrode (CNTPE) and carbon paste electrode (CPE). The calibration curve for the differential pulse voltammogram (DPV) peak current observed for paracetamol oxidation versus paracetamol concentration at PPCPE shows two linear regions. The first region demonstrates linearity over a concentration range of 2 to 0.1 mM with a correlation coefficient of 0.99638, the linear region with the concentration of paracetamol is from 0.1 to 0.02 mM with a correlation coefficient of 0.99818, the detection limit is as low as 0.005 mM and the electrochemical sensor is easy to preserve for a long time and has good reusability and stability.

Detection of promoter hypermethylation of cancer- related genes may be useful for cancer diagnosis or the detection of recurrence. p16, an inhibitor of the cyclin D-dependent protein kinases, is a classical tumor suppressor gene, and its inactivation is closely associated with carcinogenesis. p16 hyper- methylation could be detected in each stage, which is consistent with the finding that aberrant methyl- ation of p16 is a very early event in carcinogenesis. We have developed an electrochemical procedure for detecting DNA methylation of the human p16Ink4a gene. The procedure is based on the coupling of DNA electrochemical sensors with linker-PCR- amplified DNA from human gastric tumor tissue and whole blood cells of healthy human. The synthe- sized oligonucleotide was immobilized on the modi- fied gold electrode to fabricate a DNA biosensor. The hybridization reaction on the electrode surface was monitored by cyclic voltammogram (CV) and square wave voltammogram (SWV), using (Co(phen)3)(ClO4)3 as a redox indicator. Methylation status of human p16Ink4a gene was detected and the results were validated by bisulfite DNA sequencing. A good reproducibility was observed in several parallel experiments. The coupling of DNA electro- chemical sensors with PCR allowed quick detection and have the potential of the quantitative evaluation of the methylation status of the human p16Ink4a gene.",

Detection of promoter hypermethylation of cancer-related genes may be useful for cancer diagnosis or the detection of recurrence. Recently, several DNA microarray methods have been developed to detect the methylation status of the multiple genes. However, the microarrays are currently detected in fluorescence using a sophisticated laser-based scanner. These methods are limited by their lower sensitivity.We present a sensitive colorimetric silver method coupled with linker-PCR to detect methylation status of four genes, including p16, E-cadherin, VHL, and hMLH1. The signal generated with this method results from the precipitation of silver onto nanogold particles bound to streptavidin used to detect biotinylated DNA.We show that p16, E-cadherin, VHL, and hMLH1 were all methylated in the positive control. However, no methylation was found in these genes for the negative control. P16 gene was only methylated in the sample, whereas others were not methylated. Furthermore, as little as 0.1 fmol of target DNA amplicons could be detected on the arrays. The results were further validated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite DNA sequencing.The colorimetric silver detection of DNA microarray could be used as an inexpensive, useful, and sensitive tool to detect methylation status of the multiple genes in the future.",

Detection of promoter hypermethylation of cancer-related gene may be useful for cancer diagnosis or the detection of recurrence. However, most of the studies have focused on a single gene only and gave little information about the concurrent methylation status of multiple genes. In this study, we attempted to develop a microarray method coupled with linker-PCR for detecting methylation status of multiple genes in the tumor tissue. A series of synthesized oligonucleotides were synthesised and purified to completely match with 16 investigated targets. Then they were immobilized on the aldehyde-coated glass slide to fabricate a DNA microarray for detecting methylation status of these genes. The results indicated that these genes were all methylated in the positive control. However, no methylated was found in these genes for the negative control. Only p16 and p15 genes were methylated in investigated genes for the gastric tumor tissue, whereas others were not methylated. The above results were validated by bisulfite DNA sequencing. Our experiments successfully demonstrated that the DNA microarray could be applied as a high-throughput tool to determine methylation status of the investigated genes.",

        "abstract": "Liver cancer, as the second cause of cancer death all around the world, resulted in a series of chronic liver diseases. More than 80% of the patients cannot receive effective treatment because of their advanced disease or poor liver function. It is time to improve early clinical diagnosis and find optimal therapeutic treatments. As the tumor cells behave differently from the cell-surface molecules, it is necessary to find a highly specific probe. The aptamers, known as \u201cchemical antibodies\u201d, can bind to their target molecules with high affinity and high specificity. The apatmers were obtained by Cell-SELEX, which was aimed at finding the aptamers against whole living cells. In the article, after 19 selections, the ssDNA pool was cloned and sequenced. After that, six aptamers were obtained, named apt_A to apt_F. By incubating the aptamers with different cells, except apt_E, the other aptamers showed high specificity. As for apt_E, which showed high affinity to several cancer cells, was a potential probe for the common protein presented by several different cancer cells. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were evaluated by measuring the flow cytometry signal that characterized the binding ability of aptamers to the target cells at a series of concentrations ranging from 46.3(4.5) nM to 199.4(44.2) nM, which exposed the high binding affinities of these aptamers. The research in the confocal fluorescence images further confirmed the specificity of these aptamers and the fact that the aptamers were combined with the targets on the cell-surface.",

Biotinylated single-strand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products containing the SNP locus were captured by the GMNPs that were coated with streptavidin. The GMNP array was fabricated by immobilizing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-GMNP complexes onto a glass slide using a magnetic field, and SNPs were identified with dual-color fluorescence hybridization. Three different SNP loci from 24 samples were genotyped successfully using this platform. This procedure allows the user to directly analyze the bead fluorescence to determine the SNP genotype, and it eliminates the need for background subtraction for signal determination. This method also bypasses tedious PCR purification and concentration procedures, and it facilitates large-scale SNP studies by using a method that is highly sensitive, simple, labor-saving, and potentially automatable.",

This new platform integrates the rapid binding kinetics of magnetic nanoparticles carriers, the multiplexing and encoding capabilities of chips, and tagged array. As a DNA sensor, the biotinylated single-stranded DNA was obtained by asymmetry PCR amplification, and then captured by GMNPs modified with streptavidin to form GMNP-ssDNA complexes without further purification. The complexes were immobilized on the slide to fabricate bead array through magnetic field. The bead array was hybridized with the corresponding allele-specific tag probes for each locus, and a pair of given universal detectors were applied to these markers analysis. Using bead array, all samples can be analyzed in one hybridization chamber which lowers the cost of the assay. Using universal tags, only a pair of universal dual-color probes labeled fluorophores was used for multiplex genotyping. Without the need of laborious and time-consuming elution, the experiment process was simple, reproducible and easy to handle. Two SNPs loci from 12 individual samples were discriminated using this platform and the results demonstrated that the expected scores and good discrimination were obtained between the two alleles from the two SNP loci. In summary, the integrated sensitive platform is adaptable and versatile, while offering a high-throughput capability needed for genome research and clinical applications.",

It has led to a requirement for high-throughput genotyping platforms that can maximize the efficient screening functional SNPs with respect to accuracy, speed and cost. In this study, we attempted to develop a microarray-based method for scoring a number of genomic DNA in parallel for one or more molecular markers on a glass slide. Two SNP markers localized to the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) were selected as the investigated targets. Amplified PCR products from nine genomic DNA specimens were spotted and immobilized onto a poly-l-lysine coated glass slide to fabricate a microarray, then interrogated by hybridization with dual-color probes to determine the SNP genotype of each sample. The results indicated that the microarray-based method could determine the genotype of 677 and 1298 MTHFR polymorphisms. Sequencing was performed to validate these results. Our experiments successfully demonstrate that PCR products subjected to dual-color hybridization on a microarray could be applied as a useful and a high-throughput tool to analyze molecular markers.",

In these studies, multiple SNP loci from large amount of samples need to be investigated to obtain a result with a high degree of confidence. Herein, we describe a novel, cost-effective and automated method for high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyping based on universal tagged array and magnetic separation. By using two kinds of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles, the whole operation procedure including genome DNA extraction and SNP genotyping can be automatically performed by JANUS automated workstation (Perkin Elmer Inc.). Four different SNPs loci from 80 samples were scored using only one pair of universal dual-color probes, the phase of numerous SNPs can be automated assessed simultaneously. The results demonstrated that the expected scores and good discrimination were obtained between the two alleles from these four SNP loci. Due to adequately taking the advantages of high parallel read-out and intrinsically scalable properties of microarray, and the automated magnetic separation handling technology is highly adaptable fro multiplexing sample preparation and automated SNP analysis, also avoid the complex procedure including purification and concentration, the new strategy is high-throughput, simple, flexible, cost-effective, and will be very suitable for large-scale genotyping.",

This report described a novel high-throughput SNP genotyping method using magnetic nanoparticles as PCR primers carriers. PCR products were directly amplified on MNPs and interrogated by hybridization with a pair of dual-color fluorescence (Cy3, Cy5) probes to determine SNP, and then genotype of each sample can be simultaneously identified by scanning the microarray printed with the denatured fluorescent probes on an unmodified glass slide. As the results, the homozygous wild type, homozygous mutant type and heterozygote type yield strongly green, red and yellow fluorescent signals, respectively.

The fluorescent ratios (match probe signal to mismatch probe signal) of homozygous samples were over 9.0, whereas heterozygous samples had ratios near 1.0. The genotyping results were additionally validated by sequencing.

Biotinylated single base extension primer were captured onto the GMNPs coated with streptavidin. Dual-color fluorescence single base extension was employed as a tool for SNPs identification, and then a \"bead array\" was fabricated by spotting GMNPs with fluorophore on the glass slide. Using this platform, MTHFR gene C677T locus from 12 samples was genotyped. The results showed that all homozygous samples gave a signal/noise ratio over 30, and the fluorescent intensities ratios of heterozygote samples were around 1. With advantages to defeat the background subtract feature and read-out the fluorescence values of the GMNPs directly to determine their genotypes, without the necessary procedures for purification and complex reduction of PCR products, the application of this strategy to large-scale SNP studies will be simple, labor-saving, high sensitive and potential for automation.",

The experimental results indicated the optimum electrochemical performance of the prepared aptamer biosensor when the (AuNPs/CS)\u2082/GCE surface was modified with 1.0 M aptamer and incubated with Hg for 60 min. Moreover, the aptamer biosensor exhibits a good linear relationship between the logarithm of the Hg concentration and the DPV peak current in the range from 0.01 to 500 nM following the linearization equation  (A) = 2.59902 + 0.2097log (\u00b2 = 0.9994) with a limit of detection as low as 0.005 nM.

Due to its excellent characteristics, the method based on magnetic beads has become one of the main methods for nucleic acid extraction. In this research, we have developed a rapid high-quality universal nucleic acid extraction kit based on magnetic beads (MBs) and named it MB-100. Some factors affecting nucleic acid extraction were optimized, such as particle size of MBs, surface groups of MBs and lysis time. Results demonstrated that micron-grade MBs@SiO2 particles were much more appropriate for nucleic acid extraction and lysis time was 5 min. Simultaneously, the performance of MB-100 was explored. Results showed that it had much higher extraction efficiency than other two commercial kits, and the following PCR reaction also had much higher amplification efficiency.",

The adsorption behaviors of fibrinogen, albumin and fresh plasma on SWNT membrane were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The platelet adhesion and activation induced by the SWNT membrane were evaluated through SEM observations and fluorescent labeled flow cytometric analysis. Results indicated that the SWNT membrane showed a clear adsorption preference of fibrinogen over albumin. However, there was no appreciable platelet adhesion and activation occurred consequently on a SWNT membrane surface pre-absorbed with fresh plasma, and the percentage of activated platelets caused by a SWNT membrane in a platelet-rich-plasma was about 5%. The conclusion is that the SWNT membrane has unique platelet inertness in blood environments and this anticoagulant effect permits potential use in artificial organs, prostheses and tissue engineering in the cardiac-vascular systems.",

In this work, water dispersible oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (o-MWNTs) were prepared by an optimal combination of ultrasonication and concentrated acids oxidation; stable concentrations of 0.3mg/ml were obtained in deionized water of surfactant free. The o-MWNTs dispersing in water displayed a strong characteristic adsorption at 253nm in the spectra of UV/VIS/NIR. XPS analysis showed the presence of carboxylated groups on the o-MWNTs. SEM observation indicated that after the oxidation, the as received MWNTs were cut short; the average length was around 500nm-800nm, the maximum effective size obtained by DLS measurement was about 340nm. It was inferred that the oxidation degree was one major key factor to determine the stable dispersion concentration of o-MWNTs in water. The o-MWNTs dispersing in water entered into the cells and located in the cytoplasm. Cells proliferation and living cycle were affected by the o-MWNTs dispersing in the culture medium in a concentration dependant manner; the cells cultivated in the medium with high concentration of o-MWNTs underwent apoptosis to a point determined by flowcytometry and TEM respectively, while low concentration of o-MWNTs induced light suppression of cells proliferation examined with cell viability assay. \u00a9 2008 Springer-Verlag.",

We found that if water was preadsorbed on the device, the sensitivity of oxygen can be effectively enhanced; meanwhile, the response time can also be remarkably shortened. The mechanism of these phenomena, we propose, is the adsorption competition of the two kinds of molecules. Our results show that the preadsorption of appropriate gas can enhance the performance of the sensors, which is helpful for sensor designing. \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

We observe that the frequency decreases with increasing temperature for all Raman peaks of the nanotube rings. Furthermore, compared to the nanotubes with linear structure, the temperature coefficients of the radial breathing mode and G-mode frequencies of the nanotube rings are much smaller, which means the nanotube rings have more stable thermal ability.

We found that the intensity of radial breathing mode can be remarkably enhanced for surface-enhanced Raman scattering. And no frequency shift of the radial breathing mode has been observed. For the tangential mode at approximately 1590 cm(-1), the peak becomes slightly narrower for surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Both semiconducting and metallic nanotubes can be identified based on the line shape of tangential mode. Meanwhile, the intensities of tangential mode depend on laser excitation energies sensitively, which can be explained by different resonant transitional conditions.",

It was found that radial breathing mode (RBM) frequencies of DWNTs have a linear dependence on the sample temperature, but different RBM frequencies correspond to completely different temperature coefficients. The frequency-dependent temperature coefficient has been investigated and attributed to the intershell effect in DWNTs. In comparison, G-band of DWNTs has a nonlinear or second-order polynomial relation with the increased temperature. The deviation from the linear trend has been revealed to be due to the contribution of the third- and fourth-order anharmonic term in the lattice potential energy with pure temperature effect.",

We studied the association of these adducts in plasma, and the gene polymorphism of paraoxonase-2 with coronary heart disease.254 patients and 308 controls were recruited for the study. Homocysteine thiolactone adducts were determined with ELISA. The codon 311 polymorphism of paraoxonase-2 gene was genotyped by using polymerase chain reaction and restrictive digestion.The plasma level of homocysteine thiolactone adducts were significantly higher in patients than in controls (40.65 +/- 10.87 u/ml vs. 30.58 +/- 10.20 u/ml, P <0.01), with odds ratio of 7.34 (95% confidence interval 4.020-13.406, P <0.01), and increased according to the number of atherosclerotic coronary arteries: 35.59 +/- 10.34 units/ml (n = 76); 41.88 +/- 8.83 (n = 70) and 43.13 +/- 11.47 (n = 108) in subjects with 1, 2 and 3 affected arteries, respectively (r =0.174, P < 0.01). The frequency of CC genotype was significantly higher in patients with coronary heart disease (7.48%) than in controls (1.62%, P < 0.01), with adjusted odds ratio of 4.367 (95% confidence interval: 1.178 to 16.191, P < 0.01), so was the C allele (23.2% vs. 14.9%, P < 0.05).High plasma homocysteine thiolactone adducts and the CC 311 genotype of paraoxonase-2 gene may be the emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.",

The lengths of the nanobelts are up to several hundreds of micrometers, and the average width and thickness are about 400 and 30 nm, respectively. Some ring-like nanobelts, called nanorings here, are also observed. The nanobelts are characterized in detail with scanning electron microscope, X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscope, high-resolution transmission electron microscope and selected area electron diffraction. Possible growth mechanisms for the ZTO nanobelts and nanorings are proposed. In addition, the photoluminescence spectrum (PL) of the nanobelts at room temperature shows a stable broad blue-green emission around the 400-600 nm wavelengths with a maximum center at 490 nm. The strong PL emission of the nanobelts may find potential applications in nano-scale optoelectronic devices. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Searching for new energy source is one of the most important projects faced by the global, while the most ideal new energy source is solar cell. Near infrared quantum cutting luminescence method can doubly transfer large energy photon which is not sensitive to Si or Ge solar cell to small energy photon which is sensitive to Si or Ge solar cell. It can resolve the spectral mismatch problem and largely enhance solar cell efficiency. Therefore, it is significant. The concentration effect of near-infrared quantum cutting luminescence of Tm3+Bi3+\u2236YNbO4 phosphor is reported in present manuscript. Through the measurement of excitation and emission spectra, it is found that the Tm0.058Bi0.010Y0.932NbO4 powder phosphor has intense 1 820.0 nm near-infrared quantum cutting luminescence. Further analysis finds they are multi-photon quantum cutting luminescence induced by the cross-energy transfer process. The population of 1G4 energy level may be directly transferred to lower energy level mainly through {1G4\u20143H4, 3H6\u20143H5} and {1G4\u20143H5, 3H6\u20143H4} cross-energy transfer processes, i. e. one population of the 1G4 energy level may effectively lead to two populations, which are positioned at the 3H4 and 3H5 energy levels, respectively, mainly through {1G4\u20143H4, 3H6\u20143H5} and {1G4\u20143H5, 3H6\u20143H4} cross-energy transfer processes. This may also effectively lead to three populations of the 3F4 energy level through {3H4\u20143F4, 3H6\u20143F4} cross-energy transfer process from the 3H4 level and multi-phonon non-radiative relaxation from the 3H5 level, respectively. This results in the effective three-photon near-infrared quantum cutting of the 3F4\u20143H6 fluorescence of Tm3+ ion. It\u2019s also found that the sensitization action of Bi3+ ion to Tm3+ ion is very strong. The enhancement of the 1 820.0 nm near-infrared quantum cutting luminescence, of Tm0.058Bi0.010Y0.932NbO4 relative to Tm0.005Y0.995NbO4, is about 175.5 times, when excited by the 302.0 nm light. The present results are significant for the exploration of the next-generation multi-photon near-infrared quantum cutting germanium solar cell.",

        "title": "Defective Early B Cell Tolerance in Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia",
        "abstract": "AIMs:   Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common bleeding disorder characterized by low platelet counts, which could cause serious bleeding. One hallmark of ITP is the production of platelet-specific autoantibodies, resulting in accelerated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. The anti-platelet antibodies normally react with components of platelet glycoproteins (GPs), which are rich in negatively charged amino acids. However, it is not clear how these autoantibodies are generated in ITP patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the status of B cell central tolerance in ITP.   Methods:   To gain an insight into the early B cell tolerance in ITP, we investigated the B cell receptor (BCR) specificity and immunoglobulin genes of naive B cells in ITP patients. Naive B cells were sorted and distributed into 96-well PCR plates at one single cell per well by single cell flow sorting. Paired immunoglobulin heave (IgH) and light (IgL) chain genes were amplified by reverse transcription PCR from single naive B cells. The correct PCR products were subcloned into corresponding vectors and sequenced. Matched IgH and IgL genes from the same B cell were co-transfected into HEK293 cells to express recombinant antibodies (Fig. 1). The reactivity of these antibodies against platelet antigens was determined by ELISA, immunofluorescence assays, and flow cytometry. Ig gene sequence features were analyzed by programs including IMGT, IgBLAST, and VHRFA-1.   Results:   So far, 228 recombinant antibodies were expressed derived from naive B cells in 4 ITP patients and 4 healthy controls. The absolute numbers of somatic mutations (nucleotide exchanges compared with germ line) of VH and VL between naive B cells and peripheral memory B cells revealed significant difference (5.1 and 4.4 v.s. 19.0 and 14.8, p    Conclusion:   In summary, this study provides evidence of defective early B cell tolerance and accumulation of anti-platelet naive B cells in patients with ITP. This defect might be a result of insufficient receptor editing in IgL as well as excessive VH replacement in IgH.  Disclosures  No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",

        "title": "Bulk-quantity synthesis of single-crystalline indium nitride nanobelts",
        "abstract": "Wurtzite InN nanobelts have been synthesized in bulk quantities by means of in situ nitriding indium oxide powders in ammonia flux, with a high yield, high purity and good reproducibility. As-synthesized InN nanobelts have typical widths of 1\u20135 \u03bcm, thickness of 40\u201350 nm and lengths of tens to hundreds of microns imaged by scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the synthesized InN nanobelts are single crystalline in [0 0 0 1] orientation and preferentially enclosed by top surfaces \u00b1 ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) /side surfaces \u00b1 ( 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ) . Photoluminescence spectrum of InN nanobelts at room temperature shows a strong emission peak centered at 704 nm (1.76 eV). 1 Introduction One-dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials are of particular importance in nanoscience and nanotechnology for basic issues regarding dimensionality and space-confined transport phenomena [1,2] . Quasi 1D nanobelt can be viewed as an intermediate bridging 1D wires/tubes and 2D thin films. Increasing interest in nanobelts has been aroused since the discovery of oxide semiconductor nanobelts in 2001 by Pan et al. [3] . III-Nitride semiconductors are promising materials for applications in light-emitting devices and semiconductor lasers [4] . Studies on the nanostructures of these nitrides are encouraged in order to meet the potential requirements for nanoscale device applications [2] . Though the aluminum nitride (AlN) and gallium nitride (GaN) nanobelts have been synthesized by vapor-phase method [5\u20138] , to our knowledge, there are no reports of successful synthesis of InN nanobelts so far probably because the preparation of InN material is much more difficult than the synthesis of AlN and GaN due to its high equilibrium vapor pressures and low thermal stability towards decomposition [9\u201311] . It is well known that InN has some superior properties in III-nitride group such as the lowest effective mass for electrons, superior transport characteristics and a large drifty velocity at room temperature, which renders it better than AlN and GaN counterparts for use in field-effect transistors and high frequency centimeter and millimeter wave devices [12\u201314] . Therefore, the synthesis of nanostructured InN is of significance for exploring possible nanostructure-based applications and for understanding the dimension-confined effects [15\u201324] . In this Letter, we report the first successful synthesis of hexagonal wurtzite InN nanobelts via a conventional nitridation reaction route. The synthesized InN nanobelts have typical widths of 1\u20135 \u03bcm, thickness of 40\u201350 nm and lengths ranging from tens to hundreds of microns. The synthesized InN nanobelts exhibit good crystal quality and grow in [0 0 0 1] direction with a preferable surface enclosure \u2013 top surfaces \u00b1 ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) /side surfaces \u00b1 ( 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ) . The simple one-step process of oxide nitridation possesses reported in this Letter is attractive for its virtue of good reproducibility, facility, and the simple starting materials. It provides a promising approach for producing InN nanobelts in large quantity. 2 Experimental For a typical synthesis, 0.15 g In 2 O 3 powder (particle size 100\u2013300 nm, 99.99% purity) serving as starting materials was mixed with 0.05 ml gold chloride solution with a concentration of 0.05 M. The suspension was ultrasonically agitated and placed uniformly in a cleaned alumina or quartz boat. After being dried at 100 \u00b0C for half an hour, the boat was loaded into a long quartz tube which was mounted horizontally in a furnace. Oxygen content in the tube was exhausted by purging with high purity (99.999%) nitrogen. During the growth process, 60 standard cm 3 /min ammonia (NH 3 , anhydrous 99.999%) was introduced into the tube. The exhaust NH 3 was bubbled through a water reservoir before being discharged into the atmosphere. The furnace was set at 680 \u00b0C for a variety of reaction time. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data used for phase identification were collected on a Rigaku D/max 2500 diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (45 kV, 250 mA) and a continuous scan mode was employed with a scan speed of 10\u00b0/min. Morphologies and lattice fringes were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, XL30 S-FEG) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JOEL 2010, accelerating voltage of 200 kV). Raman scattering experiment on single InN belt dispersed on a germanium wafer was performed on the Dilor Super Labram with an excitation of 514 nm (2.41 eV) Ar + ion excitation. Photoluminescence spectrum was recorded at room temperature on an Accent RPM2000 PL system using a 325.0-nm HeCd laser with power of 2.1 mW as the excitation light source. 3 Results and discussion Fluffy product and a few spherical indium particles were obtained simultaneously in the boat. Indium (In) particles in diameters of 0.1\u20131 mm adhered to the bottom of the boat and could be detached easily from the fluffy product. The conversion ratio of the In 2 O 3 starting powders to fluffy products could reach as high as 65% for the reaction time of 8\u201314 h, i.e., every 100 mg In 2 O 3 powder produced 19 mg In particles and 65 mg fluffy products which are composed of pure InN nanowires without detectable residual In 2 O 3 by XRD [24] . When the reaction is held longer than 14 h, SEM and XRD measurements show that the fluffy products consist of InN nanowires and nanobelts. A high yield of nanobelts was achieved in the 38-h fluffy product which contains only a small amount of nanowires (less than 5%). Herein, we concentrate on the syntheses and the characterizations of InN nanobelts in this page-limited Letter. A typical XRD pattern obtained from the fluffy product grown for 38 h is shown in Fig. 1 . All the diffraction peaks can be indexed by a hexagonal structure with cell constants of a = 0.3539 nm and c = 0.5706 nm, which agrees well with that of Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card 50-1239 for wurtzite InN. Peaks related to In 2 O 3 were not found, indicating a high purity of the produced sample. In addition, room-temperature Raman spectrum was measured on an individual InN nanobelt. Three Raman modes at 446, 488 and 586 cm \u22121 are observed in the spectrum, which are A 1 (TO), E 2 and A 1 (LO) modes characteristic of InN, respectively [12,18,19] . FE-SEM studies reveal that InN fluffy product is composed of a large number of belt-like structures as shown in Fig. 2 . High-magnification image ( Fig. 2 b) manifests the flat belt-like configuration. Detailed investigations prove that the belts have lengths up to hundreds of microns and a broad distribution of widths from hundreds of nanometers to several microns while mostly in the range of 1\u20135 \u03bcm. The thickness of the nanobelts varies from 40 to 50 nm and the typical width-to-thickness ratios are estimated to be in the range of 20\u2013125. According to the SEM observations, a fraction of nanowires (less than 5%) also exists in the product besides the InN nanobelts. We could not find any particles attached to the ends of the nanobelts or nanowires, although external catalyst was used in our synthesis route. In addition, EDS analysis indicates that the synthesized nanobelts consist of only nitrogen and indium elements, as evidenced in Fig. 2 d. To have more details about the structure and crystallinity of the InN nanobelts, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution TEM measurements were performed on representative nanobelts and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . It is revealed that the InN nanobelts exhibit single-crystalline quality with no particles on their tips. SAED patterns indicate that the synthesized belt-like structure grows along [0 0 0 1] direction. Crystallographically, the hexagonal InN nanobelts with [0 0 0 1] longitudinal axis are enclosed either by top surfaces \u00b1 ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) /side surfaces \u00b1 ( 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ) or by top surfaces \u00b1 ( 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ) /side surfaces \u00b1 ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) because of their lower surface energies [25,26] . Detailed measurements reveal that both of these types of enclosure configurations exist in our product as shown in Fig. 3 . However, more nanobelts (80% of the measured nanobelts) with the former enclosure configuration were detected within our experimental scope, which may suggest a preferential geometrical morphology of the InN nanobelts. Considering the absence of metal particles on the tips of the nanobelts according to TEM observations, we doubt whether gold catalyst promotes the growth of nanobelts. For comparison, further experiments demonstrated that InN nanobelts could be prepared without the use of gold chloride solution, which suggests that gold addition does not catalyze the nanobelt growth at all. Therefore, we propose that the synthesis of InN nanobelts in our case is likely a vapor\u2013solid process which has been previously observed in the preparation of InN nanostructures such as nanowires and nanotubes [17,20,21] . Different ratios of InN nanowires to nanobelts were achieved depending on the reaction time in our experiments. We carefully observed the products resulted from different reaction time by means of SEM. We can confirm, when the other reaction parameters were kept, that the longer the reaction time, the higher the ratio of InN nanobelts to nanowires. During the reaction period, several processes such as thermal decomposition of InN into nitrogen and indium [9\u201311] , reconstruction of InN from NH 3 and indium [18,27] , etc., could occur simultaneously. The mechanism of repeated decomposition and recombination of InN molecules seems reasonable and to a certain degree responsible for the formation of InN nanobelts. The formation of nanobelts succeeds the growth of nanowires, but the specific evolution process has not been clearly observed. Therefore, the detailed formation mechanism of InN nanobelts remains an intriguing topic for further investigation. We measured the light-emitting property of the InN nanobelts at room temperature and a strong peak was found at 704 nm in the photoluminescence spectrum, as shown in Fig. 4 . The 704-nm emission is within the visible light and corresponds to an optical band gap of about 1.76 eV, which is in agreement with the reported results of 1D InN nanowires [18,19] and nanotubes [21,22] . The presently available experimental data on the band gap of InN show a wide distribution ranging from 0.6 to around 2.2 eV [12] . Currently, it is widely accepted that the oxygen impurity in the InN system obviously affects the band gap. Studies on single-crystalline InN thin films with an absorption edge between 0.7 and 2.0 eV indicated that oxygen contamination leads to larger band gap energy [28,29] . Although oxygen content is not detectable by XRD and EDS, the influence of oxygen on the derived band gap of the synthesized InN nanobelts cannot be ruled out, because In 2 O 3 was used as starting material in our work. However, it is surprising that Lan et al. [27] observed a band gap of 0.76 eV in the InN nanorods which coexist with considerable In 2 O 3 phase. Therefore, the intrinsic band parameters of InN are still under debate. 4 Conclusions We have shown that hexagonal InN nanobelts can be synthesized successfully by nitriding In 2 O 3 powder in NH 3 flux. The as-prepared InN nanobelts have widths of 1\u20135 \u03bcm, thickness of 40\u201350 nm and lengths up to hundreds of microns. XRD and TEM measurements demonstrate that InN nanobelts exhibit single-crystalline quality and grow along [0 0 0 1] direction with enclosure configuration of either \u00b1 ( 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ) / \u00b1 ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) or \u00b1 ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) / \u00b1 ( 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ) surfaces. A vapor\u2013solid process is supposed to be responsible for the formation of InN nanobelts. Photoluminescence spectrum of InN nanobelts at room temperature shows a strong emission peak centered at 704 nm (1.76 eV).

The AAO template method has been proved to be effective and simple as AAO itself can catalytically decompose hydrocarbon gases and deposit CNTs on the inner walls of its pores. For transmission electron microscope (TEM) characterization, the sample was etched with 6M NaOH solution to dissolve the AAO template and then rinsed by distilled water. The results show that the outer tube wall can also act as another carbon source and has influences to the inner carbon nanostructures.",

Zinc and sulfur powders are used as sources in the different temperature zones. X-ray diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffraction (SEAD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis show that the ZnS nanoribbons are the wurtzite structure, and there are two types-single-crystal and bicrystal nanoribbons. Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum shows that the spectrum mainly includes two parts: a purple emission band centering at about 390 nm and a blue emission band centering at about 445 nm with a weak green shoulder around 510 nm.",

T ed pores and ridge-like features on the Al surface are observed under the SiO2 mask by scanning electron microscopy characterization. A mechanism based on the deflection of electric field due to the existence of SiO2 barrier on Al surface has been proposed to explain the observed anodizing behavior. Moreover, large-scale ordered metallic Al patterns are also revealed by removing the AAO film and SiO2 mask. \u00a9 2005 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.",

Tens of milligrams of nanowires are obtained in one batch. Every 100 mg of In(2)O(3) starting powder can produce up to 65 mg of InN nanowires under the optimized conditions. The synthesized nanowires grow along the [001] direction with excellent crystallinity. They are of high purity and are 30-50 microm in length with an almost uniform diameter of about 100 nm. Photoluminescence measurements of the nanowires exhibit a strong peak at 707 nm. An optical bandgap of about 1.7 eV is estimated based on the absorption spectrum. The experimental results also demonstrate that the approach of nitriding In(2)O(3) powders in situ is feasible for the synthesis of high-purity InN nanowires in large quantities, with good reproducibility and without catalyst materials. The synthesis of InN nanowires in large quantities would be of benefit to the further study and understanding of their intrinsic properties, as well as being advantageous for their potential application in nanodevices.",

It was indicated that SWCNTs were effectively aligned under ac electric fields after they had just grown in the furnace. The time for a SWONT to be aligned in the electric field and the effect of gas flow were estimated. Polarized Raman scattering was performed to characterize the aligned structure of SWCNTs.

        "abstract": "NixZn1-x alloy nanowires were successfully prepared by the templated electrodeposition technique. The morphology and the microstructures of as-deposited nanowires were examined by scanning electron microscope, x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and electron diffraction. It is demonstrated that the content of magnetic element Ni in the nanowires can be easily adjusted by changing the ingredients of the electrolyte, the deposited current density and the deposited voltage, which is critical to tune the magnetic property of the nanowires. X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction analysis indicate that the NixZn1-x nanowires exhibit different structures with the variation in the quantity of nickel in the nanowires. It is expected that these heterogeneous alloy nanowires will have a potential application in nanoscale giant-magnetoresistance devices.",

Although they can be manufactured using a number of printing and lithography techniques, continued improvements in cost, scalability and form factor are required to realize their full potential. Here, we demonstrate the scalable fabrication of a new type of all-carbon, monolithic supercapacitor by laser reduction and patterning of graphite oxide films. We pattern both in-plane and conventional electrodes consisting of reduced graphite oxide with micrometre resolution, between which graphite oxide serves as a solid electrolyte. The substantial amounts of trapped water in the graphite oxide makes it simultaneously a good ionic conductor and an electrical insulator, allowing it to serve as both an electrolyte and an electrode separator with ion transport characteristics similar to that observed for Nafion membranes. The resulting micro-supercapacitor devices show good cyclic stability, and energy storage capacities comparable to existing thin-film supercapacitors.",

The transferred printed patterns consist of single- and few-layer graphene with macroscopic continuity. Raman spectra show that some defects appear along the edges of the graphene patterns, which were induced by the oxygen plasma-etching treatment of the HOPG surface. This transfer-printing technique paves a new and simple way to get large-scale graphene patterns on to any substrates.",

These have been synthesized either by nanolithography or from starting materials such as graphene oxide (GO) by the chemical breakdown of their extended planar structure, both of which are multistep tedious processes. Here, we report that during the acid treatment and chemical exfoliation of traditional pitch-based carbon fibers, that are both cheap and commercially available, the stacked graphitic submicrometer domains of the fibers are easily broken down, leading to the creation of GQDs with different size distribution in scalable amounts. The as-produced GQDs, in the size range of 1-4 nm, show two-dimensional morphology, most of which present zigzag edge structure, and are 1-3 atomic layers thick. The photoluminescence of the GQDs can be tailored through varying the size of the GQDs by changing process parameters. Due to the luminescence stability, nanosecond lifetime, biocompatibility, low toxicity, and high water solubility, these GQDs are demonstrated to be excellent probes for high contrast bioimaging and biosensing applications.",

Here, we demonstrate the growth of large-area sulfur (S)-doped graphene sheets on copper substrate via the chemical vapor deposition technique by using liquid organics (hexane in the presence of S) as the precursor. We found that S could be doped into graphene's lattice and mainly formed linear nanodomains, which was proved by elemental analysis, high resolution transmission microscopy and Raman spectra. Measurements on S-doped graphene field-effect transistors (G-FETs) revealed that S-doped graphene exhibited lower conductivity and distinctive p-type semiconductor properties compared with those of pristine graphene. Our approach has produced a new member in the family of graphene based materials and is promising for producing graphene based devices for multiple applications.",

The surface area of the resulting carbon layers increases to a value more than fourfold over that of the starting precursor materials.

        "abstract": "In this letter, the sandwich-like single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) paper/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) composites were successfully prepared by using a hot-compress method. Based on SEM observation, it was found that the PEEK macromolecules could diffuse into the voids of SWNT paper and were able to form very good bonding to the nanotube bundles, which ensure effective stress transfer between two phases. Some typical problems in preparing conventional carbon nanotube/polymer composites, e.g. the difficulty to obtain well-dispersed high-loading nanotubes into polymer matrices, were successfully overcome. Moreover, the compact networks of SWNTs were not destroyed at the appropriate processing condition. Correspondingly, the resulting composite (with one layer of SWNT paper) exhibited about 40% increased in Young\u2019s modulus and 4% enhanced in failure strength when comparing with that of neat PEEK, respectively. According to rule-of-mixtures of the special sandwich-like structure, the estimated Young\u2019s modulus can reach up to about 8 GPa, which was nearly three times of that of neat matrix. Moreover, the surface electric conductivity and thermal conductivity of the PEEK films were also increased after the addition of SWNT paper. The preliminary results suggest that the SWNT paper has great potential for being used to reinforce polymers.",

        "abstract": "The adsorption behavior of human fibrinogen (Hfg) on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) films was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. It was shown in the SEM images that fibrinogen was adsorbed strongly on the surface of SWNT when the samples were incubated in the Hfg solutions for 10 min. The dependence of adsorption on the concentration of fibrinogen was also investigated and it was found that adsorption increased with increasing concentration. In order to further explore the adsorption of fibrinogen on SWNT surface, NEXAFS spectra were obtained at the N K-edge and the C K-edge. The results confirmed the conclusion regarding the dependence of adsorption on fibrinogen concentration. It is demonstrated that, due to its high sensitivity to the surface elements, NEXAFS spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the adsorption of fibrinogen on SWNT films.",

The obtained SWNTs are highly dense and perfectly aligned. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicates that the highly dense and perfectly aligned SWNTs (HDPA-SWNTs) form a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant of 19.62 A. We observe a sharp (002) reflection in the XRD pattern, which should be ascribed to an intertube spacing 3.39 A of adjacent SWNTs. Raman spectra reveal that the radical breath mode (RBM) of SWNTs with larger diameter in the HDPA-SWNTs is suppressed compared with that of as-grown SWNTs. The HDPA-SWNTs have a large density, approximately 1.09 g/cm 3, and a low resistivity, approximately 2 m Omega cm, at room temperature, as well as a large response to light illumination.",

        "abstract": "PbTiO 3 nanotube arrays have been synthesized via sol\u2013gel template method, and their morphology and structures have been determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The diameter and length of these nanotubes are about 300 nm and 50 \u03bcm, respectively, and their wall thickness is typically several tens of nanometers. XRD data shows that as-prepared PTO nanotubes possess perovskite structure, and electron diffraction demonstrates that they are polycrystalline. Photoluminescence spectrum of PTO nanotubes reveals an intense and wide emission band centered at 505 nm. Polarization\u2013electric field ( P \u2013 E ) response curves of PTO nanotube array were measured, and the hysteresis loops illustrate a room temperature ferroelectric characteristic of as-prepared PTO nanotubes. Keywords PbTiO 3 Nanotubes Photoluminescence Ferroelectricity 1 Introduction Quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) oxide nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanotubes and nanobelts, are attracting more and more attention because of their novel properties compared to their bulk counterparts and potential applications in nanoelectronics, nano-optics and nanodevices [1\u20134] . To date, most Q1D simple oxides, for example, ZnO, SiO 2 , In 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , SnO 2 , MgO, etc., have been extensively studied [5\u201316] . Currently, it has an increasing research interest in Q1D multicomponent complex oxides [4,17\u201325] . In general, the fabrication of Q1D complex oxide nanostructures is relatively difficult through conventional physical or chemical vapor deposition approaches. Although several examples of solution-based syntheses of perovskite nanowires have been reported recently [18,19,25] , sol\u2013gel template synthesis, in contrast, has been proven to be a simple and low-cost method for fabricating complex oxide nanowires or nanotubes. Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) is one of the most widely used templates currently because of its highly ordered nanoporous structure, controllable pore size and excellent chemical stability at high temperature. It is expected that most Q1D complex oxide nanowires or nanotubes can be synthesized via sol\u2013gel template method as long as the ingredient and concentration of precursor sol can be properly controlled and the sol can wet out the nanochannel surfaces of AAO template. Lead titanate (PbTiO 3 , PTO) has been widely used in optoelectrics, transducers, sensors and non-volatile memory devices due to its remarkable ferroelectric, pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties [26] . More recently, PTO nanostructures become more and more attractive because they are promising candidates for high-density, non-volatile information storage and scanning probe-based ferroelectric mass storage [27,28] . Several reports have been dedicated to the synthesis and characterization of PTO nanotubes and nanowires [20,29,30] . In the aspects of physical properties, although size-induced ferroelectric phase transitions of PTO nanotubes has been investigated [22] , the photoluminescence (PL) property and polarization\u2013electric field ( P \u2013 E ) loops of PTO nanotube arrays are still rarely reported [31] . In this article, we will report the sol\u2013gel template synthesis and structural characterization of PTO nanotubes. Furthermore, photoluminescence and P \u2013 E loops of PTO nanotube arrays will also be discussed. 2 Experimental The commercially available AAO membranes (Whatman Anodisc 47, nominal pore diameter 200 nm) were used as templates in our experiments. The precursor sol was prepared as follows: 9.552 g lead acetate (Pb(OAc) 2 , AR) with 5% excess was firstly dissolved in 10 ml glacial acetic acid, and then the solution was refluxed at 60 \u00b0C under stirring for 0.5 h. The reason why 5% excess of lead is added in the precursor is to compensate the lead loss during thermal annealing. This has been widely used in the sol\u2013gel synthesis of PTO thin films [22,32,33] . After refluxing, the solution was cooled down to room temperature. A second solution of 7 ml purified Ti(OPr i ) 4 and 10 ml ethanol was added to the lead acetate solution drop by drop. Next, the mixed solution was stirred for several hours to obtain clear sol. Then, the AAO template was immersed into the sol. The immersion time was about 3 h. After that, the AAO template was washed carefully with ethanol for several times to remove the residual sol coated on template surfaces, and dried in air for 0.5 h. The AAO template embedded with PTO gel was calcined in air at a rate of 50 \u00b0C/h to 650 \u00b0C and was maintained at this temperature for 6 h, then was cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 30 \u00b0C/h. The morphology and structure of as-prepared PTO nanotubes were determined by field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-5200), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Riguka) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2010). For SEM and TEM observations, the AAO template embedded with PTO nanotubes was soaked in 4 M NaOH solution for 6 h to remove alumina completely, then the resulting product was washed with distilled water for several times. It was found that the released PTO nanotubes could still keep the closely packed film-like morphology even after removal of the template. Some PTO nanotube films were placed on SEM sample holder to perform morphology observation. For TEM investigation, the film was put in deionized water and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for several minutes, then a drop of suspension was placed on carbon-coated copper grid to carry out TEM studies. The PL spectrum was collected by a fluorescence spectrometer (PTI-C-700) equipped with He\u2013Cd laser ( \u03bb = 325 nm, 50 mW). To measure P \u2013 E hysteresis loops of PTO nanotube array, both surfaces of the array were firstly polished carefully with sand paper until PTO nanotubes were emerged, and then a layer of Au with a thickness of 100 nm was sputtered on both sides of the template as conductive contacts. The measurement was performed at a nonlinear ferroelectric thin film testing system (Technologies, RT6000S). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows typical SEM images of as-prepared PTO nanotube array after removal of AAO template. Fig. 1 (a) is an overview image of the array. It can be seen that PTO nanotubes still keep aligned morphology even in the absence of the support from AAO template. The length of nanotubes is about 50 \u03bcm, consistent with the thickness of template. A close top view SEM image of PTO nanotube array is given in Fig. 1 (b). From this picture, the open-ended tubular structure can be clearly seen. The magnified top view image is shown in the inset of Fig. 1 (b), illustrating that the average outer diameter and wall thickness of as-prepared nanotubes are about 300 nm and 40 nm, respectively. The particles at the tube mouths are a result of incomplete removal of PTO sol from template surface. Fig. 1 (c) displays a side view image of PTO nanotube array. It is evident that the nanotubes are highly parallel to each other and have a closely packed morphology. Fig. 1 (d) represents a SEM image taken from the middle part of the nanotube array. The fractures resulted from sample preparation process clearly demonstrate that the nanotubes are hollow through the whole length, instead of just at the ends. Fig. 1 (e) shows a representative energy-disperse X-ray (EDX) spectrum of as-prepared PTO nanotubes. It is clear that the nanotubes consist of Pb, Ti and O. The atomic ratio of these three elements is given in the inset of Fig. 1 (e), showing that Pb:Ti:O is approximate to 1:1:3. This demonstrates that the as-prepared PTO nanotubes have an ideal stoichiometric ratio. It is believed that AAO templates we used here played an important role on the formation of nanotubes. As is known, AAO templates have hydrophilic inner surfaces, so the sol entered the nanochannels through capillary action can be easily adsorbed on the channel surfaces, facilitating the tube formation. On the other hand, the 50 \u03bcm channel length is too long to allow for more sol solution to enter. Thus, the sol can only fill the nanochannels incompletely, so that solid fibers are difficult to be obtained. In fact, Hernandez et al. have also demonstrated previously that shorter channel length is more conducive to the formation of solid fibers, while using 50-\u03bcm thick AAO template yields only nanotubes [22] . The XRD patterns of as-prepared PTO nanotube array embedded in AAO template and PTO gel powders calcined at the same condition are presented in Fig. 2 . Since alumina template begins to be crystallized only when it is annealed above 800 \u00b0C [34,35] , it does not contribute any diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern in present case. From Fig. 2 , it is found that all diffraction peaks of PTO gel powders are well consistent with standard powder XRD pattern of tetragonal perovskite PTO (JCPDS 78-0299), and no other impurity phases were detected, which demonstrates the formation of pure tetragonal ferroelectric phase. In contrast, PTO nanotube sample exhibits a similar XRD pattern, but the diffraction peaks of nanotubes are obviously broader. The average crystallite sizes of PTO gel powders and PTO nanotubes are estimated by Scherrer formula after performing proper instrumental broadening correction with LaB 6 standard sample. Scherrer formula can be written as (1) D = K \u03bb \u03b2 \u2009 cos \u2009 \u03b8 where D stands for crystallite size, K \u2248 0.89 is Scherrer constant, and \u03bb and \u03b2 represent the wavelength of X-ray and full width at half maximum of the corresponding diffraction peaks, respectively. Since the shape of PTO nano-crystallites may not be spherical, the crystallite sizes of top three strong diffractions (that is, (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (1 1 1) diffractions) are calculated and their average value is given. As-calculated average crystallite sizes for PTO gel powders and PTO nanotubes are 69.4 nm and 24.3 nm, respectively. It is evident that the average crystallite size of PTO gel powders is nearly three times larger than that of PTO nanotubes, although they were prepared in the same condition. This implies that AAO template may have a confinement effect on the coalescence of PTO nano-crystallites, as suggested by Hernandez et al. [22] . In addition to small crystallite size, another reason responsible for the XRD peak broadening of PTO nanotubes is their poor crystallinity. This will be demonstrated by the HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3 (b), which displays the presence of amorphous PTO besides PTO nano-crystallites. According to Fig. 2 , it is also noted that the proximate double-peak diffractions in nanotube sample is disappeared. This seems to imply the formation of cubic paraelectric phase (JCPDS 70-0747) in as-prepared PTO nanotubes. However, it is known that when evaluating nanomaterials via powder XRD method, the effect of line broadening will sometimes cause a pseudocubic structure to be observed [22,36] . Therefore, it could not be concluded readily now that the PTO nanotubes are paraelectric although they reveal a cubic structure. In fact, we noted that similar result was also reported by Hernandez et al. [22] . They clarified that the cubic paraelectric structure of PTO nanotubes determined by XRD was actually a pseudocubic phase caused by line broadening, and they further confirmed the ferroelectric feature of PTO nanotubes by Raman scattering. In our case, we will also demonstrate below that PTO nanotubes we prepared are ferroelectric at room temperature through P \u2013 E loop measurements. Fig. 3 (a) displays a typical TEM image of as-prepared PTO nanotube. From this picture, it can be seen that the outer diameter of PTO nanotube is uniform along the axial direction, but the wall thickness is inhomogeneous, probably due to the inhomogeneous covering of precursor sol on the channel surfaces. The electron diffraction pattern is given in the inset of Fig. 3 (a). The ring-like diffractions clearly demonstrate the polycrystalline character of as-prepared nanotubes, which is in agreement with XRD data. For obtaining further insight about the microstructures of the nanotubes, HRTEM was performed. It is found that the nanotubes actually consist of many PTO nano-crystallites dispersed in amorphous PTO matrix. One of representative HRTEM images of the crystallites is shown in Fig. 3 (b). The interplanar distance of the crystallite is about 0.39 nm, corresponding to that of PTO (1 0 0) crystal planes. The average size of the crystallites is approximate to 20 nm, slightly smaller than that calculated by Scherrer formula (24.3 nm). Although perovskite-type titanates have been extensively studied for many years, their PL properties were neglected. Until recently, the discovery of room temperature PL emission in amorphous ABO 3 perovskites stimulates considerable research interests in room temperature PL of this class of materials [37\u201343] . Here, room temperature PL behavior of as-prepared PTO nanotubes embedded in AAO template is investigated. For reference, the PL spectra of empty AAO template as well as PTO gel powders are also given. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) shows the PL spectra of AAO template and PTO nanotubes embedded in template, respectively. As is depicted in Fig. 4 (a), two broad emission bands centered at 408 nm and 455 nm were detected. In contrast, the PL spectrum of PTO nanotubes embedded in template can be fitted with three bands centered at 407 nm, 455 nm and 505 nm, respectively, just like the dash curves shown in Fig. 4 (b). Compared with Fig. 4 (a), it is evident that the first two PL bands are originated from the emission of AAO template, while the last band centered at 505 nm is the emission of PTO nanotubes themselves. Fig. 4 (c) displays the PL spectrum of well-crystallized PTO gel powders (as shown in Fig. 2 ). No PL peaks can be detected except the background of excited light source. This agrees well with previous reports [37\u201343] , which have demonstrated that room temperature PL cannot be observed in well-crystallized ABO 3 materials. Now there is a consensus that room temperature PL emission of amorphous ABO 3 materials is mainly originated from their structural disorder [43] . We consider that this should also be the origin of room temperature PL of PTO nanotubes studied here. As we can see from Fig. 3 (b), the PTO nanotubes consist of small PTO nano-crystallites dispersed in amorphous PTO matrix. Such structural disorder will result in a non-uniform band gap structure [37\u201340] . On one hand, the presence of amorphous PTO will introduce localized tail states in which electrons or holes may be trapped. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically that there exist two kinds of Ti coordination in amorphous PTO, fivefold oxygen Ti coordination (TiO 5 square base pyramid) and sixfold oxygen Ti coordination (TiO 6 octahedron) [40,42] . The coexistence of [TiO 5 ] and [TiO 6 ] clusters will yield a charge imbalance that encourages the trapping of holes in previously mentioned localized states. In addition, a large amount of surface defects and oxygen vacancies are usually existed in sol\u2013gel synthesized materials, and consequently yield gap states. Since the PL emission of PTO nanotubes is centered at 505 nm (2.46 eV), It could not result from the direct energy gap transition because the band gaps of PTO ceramic and sol\u2013gel-derived films are around 3.6 eV [44] . Thus, the photoluminescence of PTO nanotubes may be attributed to the radiative recombination between trapped electrons and trapped holes in tail and gap states. This radiative recombination mechanism of PL emission in amorphous PTO nanomaterials has been proven by Leite et al. [39,42,43] . For investigating the ferroelectric feature of as-prepared PTO nanotubes, the P \u2013 E loops of nanotube array were measured at room temperature. Fig. 5 (a) is the schematic diagram of P \u2013 E curve measurement. The sample stage and two probes are made of stainless steel. One of probes (probe 1) always kept contact with sample stage during the measurement, so that they had equal potential. The PTO nanotube array embedded in AAO template with top and bottom Au electrodes was directly placed on the surface of sample stage, thus, the bottom electrode also got a same potential with sample stage and probe 1. Then another probe (probe 2) was drived to approach the top electrode of PTO nanotube array. A capacitance detector was applied between the two probes to monitor the capacitance between probe 2 and top electrode. When probe 2 did not touch the top electrode, the detector shown the capacitance of the air. But when probe 2 had a good contact with top electrode, the capacitance would have a sharp change. At this point, the measurement could start. P \u2013 E loops measured within different voltage ranges are displayed in Fig. 5 (b). Here, the polarization values have been normalized to the area fraction of PTO nanotubes. The hysteresis behavior unambiguously demonstrates the room temperature ferroelectricity of as-prepared PTO nanotubes. It also clarifies that the cubic structure of PTO nanotubes determined by XRD does represent \u201cpseudocubic\u201d phase, and is not a real paraelectric phase. From Fig. 5 (b), it also can be seen that the hysteresis can even occur when the applied voltage changes only within a small range of \u22121 V to +1 V, indicating that the PTO nanotubes are easily polarized. With the increase of applied voltage range, both remanent polarization and coercive field enlarge gradually. However, leaky behavior is shown when high voltage is applied, as can be seen from the bending corner of P \u2013 E loops at extreme applied voltage. We also prepared PTO nanotubes with different diameter and wall thickness successfully. This was achieved by varying pore diameter of template and the immersion time of AAO template in precursor sol. The investigation about the influence of diameter and wall thickness on photoluminescence and ferroelectric properties is in progress. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have successfully prepared PTO nanotube array via sol\u2013gel template approach. The morphology and structures were investigated by SEM, XRD and TEM in detail. Room temperature PL property of as-prepared PTO nanotubes was studied, and a wide PL band centered at 505 nm was detected. It is considered that the luminescence emission is attributed to the polycrystalline microstructures and is originated from the radiative recombination of trapped electrons and holes in tail and gap states. Furthermore, P \u2013 E loops of as-prepared PTO nanotube array were measured, and the hysteresis clearly demonstrates the room temperature ferroelectricity of the nanotubes, indicating PTO nanotube array is potential media as ferroelectric information storage.

        "abstract": "Nonwoven single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) are novel materials with a nanotopography macroscopic surface and pure-carbon composition, which may serve as coatings on implants in blood-contact environments.The adsorption behavior of albumin, fibrinogen, and fresh plasma on SWNT membranes was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray, and direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Platelet adhesion and activation were investigated in vitro using SEM observation, and via flow cytometry analysis by PAC-1, which binds to GPIIb/IIIa expressed on activated platelets.Nonwoven SWNTs clearly displayed greater adsorption preference for fibrinogen than for albumin. However, adhered platelets were not observed by SEM. Results obtained from flow cytometry analysis further proved very low expression of GPIIb/IIIa on platelets caused by nonwoven SWNTs.The function of adsorbed fibrinogen to mediate platelet recognition, adhesion, activation, and aggregation was significantly suppressed, which induced extremely low levels of platelet adhesion and activation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we discussed recent studies done in our laboratories with a floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. We can grow single- or double-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs/DWNTs) with different kinds of catalysts. Single-walled carbon nanotubes without amorphous carbon coating were prepared by thermally decomposing acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) at the temperature range of 750\u20131200 \u00b0C with ferrocene as catalyst. While with sulfur promoted ferrocene catalyst, double-walled carbon nanotubes were mass-produced by pyrolizing C 2 H 2 at the temperature range of 900\u20131100 \u00b0C. Furthermore, tunable growth of DWNTs with different diameter was achieved in our experiment. It is found that DWNTs produced at lower carbon partial pressure have much smaller inner tubes, even DWNTs with the smallest inner diameter of 0.4 nm was found in here. As convenient and effective tool, radial breathing mode (RBM) of Raman scattering technique can be used to distinguish SWNTs from DWNTs. In further studies of Raman scattering with DWNTs, the possible match of the inner tubes and the outer tubes according to the RBM bands was assigned, and different chirality types were discussed according to the diameter and chirality dependence of resonant Raman vibration. We also investigated the temperature-dependent frequency shift of resonant Raman spectra of DWNTs in the range of 78\u2013650 K. We found that different RBM peaks, which are relative to different tube diameters, have different temperature coefficient of frequency shift, and the larger diameter carbon nanotubes have more RBM frequency downshift with increasing temperature. It is ascribed to the RBM frequency variation to the temperature dependence of the stretching force constant of C\u2013C bond. Besides, Polarized Raman spectra were preformed on well-aligned SWNTs structure fabricated through post-growth method and found that the angular dependence of Raman intensity is consistent well with the predictions of the resonance Raman theory. Keywords Single-/double-walled carbon nanotubes Pyrolysis Microstructure Raman scattering Mechanical property 1 Introduction Since the discovery, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much attention because of their unique structural and physical properties and many potential applications [1\u20133] . During the process toward the practical application, it is a critical issue to be addressed that how to make CNTs optionally, especially with specific diameter and certain chirality. The controlled synthesis single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and double-wall carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) have received much attention over the past decade including different methods, such as laser vaporization, DC arc discharge, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [4\u201327] . Among these, a continuous CVD synthetic method, in which SWNTs are grown in a flowing gaseous feedstock mixture, was developed to provide a mass-production method of SWNTs [4\u201312] . Compared with SWNTs, DWNTs were firstly produced as the dominant products by the arc discharge technique with a catalyst mixture of Ni, Co, Fe, and S [13] . Subsequently, several works have been issued in recent years to discuss the synthesis of DWNTs [14\u201321] . Otherwise, Iijima and co-workers reported that SWNTs and DWNTs could be produced synchronously by the decomposition of methane on mesoporous silica, whereas the zeolite support material is reported to yield only SWNTs [22] . In this paper, we have selectively synthesized single- or double-walled carbon nanotubes by the floating catalyst CVD method during the past three years [23\u201327] . In our studies, we reported that C 2 H 2 could be a very ideal carbon feedstock to produce clean and pure SWNTs by controlling the experimental parameters carefully. Experiments here may be helpful to grow SWNTs from other hydrocarbon by the floating catalyst process. We also found that double-wall carbon nanotubes can be synthesized as the dominant products by adding sulfur as a promoter in the same system. Our experiments indicated that the growth of DWNTs was strongly dependent on the sulfur addition, and without sulfur only SWNTs were produced. After developed the experimental set-up, tough texture of single-walled carbon nanotubes with area up to several tens square centimeters (called SWNTs nonwoven) was prepared by thermally decomposing methane (CH 4 ) in a developed floating CVD method [28] . It is found that the SWNT nonwoven exhibited extremely high Young's Modulus of ca. 0.4\u20130.7 TPa. Simple purification method, including oxidation in air and treatment with concentrated HCl, was performed to eliminate impurities in original samples. On the other hand, Raman scattering spectroscopy was employed to identify SWNTs or DWNTs in our characterized methods [23,29] . Similar to that of SWNTs, Raman spectra of DWNTs has been experimentally shown to be resonant process and displayed two \u2018fingerprint\u2019 features of the radial breathing mode (RBM) at the lower frequency range and the splitting tangential mode (TM). However, we found that RBM frequencies of DWNTs take a wider range and display much richer peaks than those of SWNTs. It is shown that the peak position and line shape of Raman bands of DWNTs were strongly dependent on the laser energies due to the resonant Raman vibration [30] . With different excitations, we discussed the possible match of the inner tubes and the outer tubes according to the RBM bands and the different chirality types according to the diameter and chirality dependence of resonant Raman vibration. It is found that tubes (the inner or outer layers of DWNTs) with all kinds of chiralities could be synthesized, and a DWNT can have any combination of chiralities of the inner and outer tubes. Otherwise, the temperature-dependent Raman spectra of DWCNTs is also discussed [31] . We show here that different RBM peaks, which are relative to different tube diameters, have different Raman frequency shifts, and we attribute the RBm frequency variation to the temperature-dependent C\u2013C bond stretching force constant. Besides, polarized Raman spectra were preformed on well-aligned SWNTs structure fabricated through post-growth method. It is found that the angular dependence of Raman intensity is consistent well with the predictions of the resonance Raman theory. 2 Experimental Our experimental set-up is a two-stage furnace system fitted with a quartz tube (30 mm i.d.), which is shown in Fig. 1 . Ferrocene (dicyclopentadienyl iron), acting as the source of catalyst, was sublimed in the first furnace at the temperature 60\u201390 \u00b0C. The sublimed ferrocene was carried by the flowing Argon (1200 sccm) and acetylene (3\u201310 sccm) mixture into the second furnace. The SWNTs growth temperature (the temperature of the second furnace) can vary from 750 to 1200 \u00b0C. The pressure inside the quartz tube was held constantly at 1 atm in all the following experiments. The as-grown SWNTs products were collected as piece of films at the outlet. As to the growth of DWNTs, Ferrocene and sulfur powder were mixed uniformly and ground with mortar, and the catalyst mixture was sublimed in the first furnace. The other experimental parameters are same as those in the SWNTs production. For purification, the as-grown samples were heated in air at 400\u2013500 \u00b0C for 48 h to oxidize Fe catalyst particles and other carbon impurity, and then immersed into concentrated HCl (38%) to dissolve the iron oxides. Finally, the samples were repeatedly washed with deionized water until the pH value of the filtrate almost equal to seven. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and micro-Raman spectroscopy (RM2000, JY64000) were performed to characterize the products. A special tensile machine was used to directly measure the mechanical properties of the samples. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 General results 3.1.1 Morphology of the as-grown SWNTs Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) without amorphous carbon coating were prepared by thermally decomposing acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) at the temperature range of 750\u20131200 \u00b0C in this floating iron catalyst system [23] . Fig. 2 (a) shows a typical SEM image of the as-grown SWNTs product. It is clear that the products mainly consist of thousands of entangled filaments with very small diameter and small particles, and most of the small particles seem decorate on those filaments and are shown as bright color in the image. High resolution TEM image ( Fig. 2 (b)) shows that all of those filaments are SWNT bundles or individual SWNTs, and the particles are metal catalysts encapsulated by two or three graphite layers. Analysis of EDS indicates that the particles are iron. No amorphous carbon was found on the SWNTs. In further investigation, we studied the effect of the experimental parameters, including reaction temperature and partial pressure of hydrocarbon. We found that the optimized temperatures for the growth of SWNTs are in the range of 900\u20131000 \u00b0C, which is different from other reports that the highest SWNTs\u2019 yield were often achieved at their highest available temperature up to 1200 \u00b0C [6 and 7]. The reason that we do not obtain highest yield at the higher temperature may be ascribed to the rate-limiting step for growth of SWNT is changed due to the much quicker thermal decomposition of C 2 H 2 at the higher temperature. We also found that the partial pressure of hydrocarbon is much crucial to synthesize SWNTs. When the C 2 H 2 partial pressure was higher than 12 Torr, almost no SWNTs could be obtained. At the controllable C 2 H 2 partial pressures blow 5.0 Torr, the product mass increased with the C 2 H 2 partial pressure increased. When the C 2 H 2 partial pressure excess 5.0 Torr, more thermal decomposed carbon was produced, which may make the catalyst particles inactive, and resulted in the decrease of SWNT production. Illumed from the above investigation, we developed experimental set-up and then prepared the self-assembled two-dimensional random networks composed of isolated SWNTs, which is discussed in Ref. [24] . The remarkable advantage of the technique is that the random networks can be formed at relatively low temperature with a wide density range, which is distinct from the previous reports. 3.1.2 Morphology of the as-grown DWNTs It is reported that the addition of sulfur to the starting materials could increase significantly the yield of SWCNTs in the arc discharge system [32] or in the floating catalyst CVD system [4] . Although our original intention by adding sulfur was to improve the production rate of SWNTs, most of the nanotubes in the products consist of two concentric graphene layers (DWNTs). We reported here that DWNTs were mass-produced by pyrolizing C 2 H 2 at the temperature range of 900\u20131100 \u00b0C on the floating iron catalyst with sulfur added [25\u201327] . Morphology of as-grown DWNTs is shown in Fig. 3 . Compared with above SWNTs, Fig. 3 (a) revealed that the fraction of filaments in the as-grown sulfur promoted products is higher than that produced without sulfur addition. Fig. 3 (b) is an HRTEM image of discrete DWNTs. The outer diameter of the larger DWCNT (Labeled A) is 1.86 nm with an inner diameter of 1.13 nm, and the outer diameter of the smaller one (Labeled B) is 1.17 nm with an inner diameter of 0.40 nm. It was well known that nanotube with diameter 0.40 nm is the smallest carbon tube that is energetically stable, and they were produced by the arc discharge method [33] or by pyrolysis of tripropylamine molecules in the channels of porous zeoliteAlPO 4 \u22125 single crystals [34] . Here, we find that DWNTs with the smallest inner tube diameter can be synthesized in the floating catalyst CVD system, and the detail is given in Ref. [35] . Similar to SWNTs, DWNTs also form into bundles readily. Fig. 3 (c) shows an HRTEM image of DWNTs bundles. It is difficult to identify the individual DWNT in the bundles due to the overlapping scattering of the tubes. However, the double-walled feature of these tubes is clearly visible on the periphery of the bundles or those discrete tubes. The product of DWNTs has been systematically studied as a function of the reaction temperature, the partial pressure of hydrocarbon, the sublimed temperature of ferrocene, and the relative molar value of ferrocene to sulfur. We found that the rational reaction temperature was at the range of 950\u20131150 \u00b0C and the partial pressure of C 2 H 2 played a great role in producing the DWNTs at a given temperature. Through Hafner et al. [15] got a considerable amount of DWNTs with C 2 H 4 at temperature of 850 \u00b0C, in our experiments with C 2 H 2 as the carbon source in a floating iron catalyst system, it was more suitable to increase the temperature up to 950 \u00b0C. As the temperature increased above 950 \u00b0C, the yield of DWNTs as well as the quality was enhanced. However, when the temperature was above 1150 \u00b0C, the higher yield of the products was obtained, but most of them were amorphous carbon. The abnormality should be ascribed to the effect of temperature on the size of catalytic particles, due to the congregated tendency of the catalyst particles at the higher temperature. Compared with SWNTs, the appropriate reaction temperature in the experiment of DWNTs was higher than that of SWNTs in the similar method only without additive of sulfur. We ascribed that to the selective poisoning the surface of the iron catalyst particles by sulfur atoms. With the additive sulfur, the surface of the catalyst particles will reconstruct, which, coupling with the blocking action of sulfur atoms, will retard the formation of the graphitic overlayer outside the particles until the much higher temperature [36] . As to the partial pressure of C 2 H 2 , it is found the optimal pressure was 0.25 Torr. In further studies, we reported that tunable growth of DWNTs with different diameter was achieved by controlled the experimental parameters in this floating catalyst system [29] . It indicates that DWNTs produced at lower carbon partial pressure have much smaller inner tubes. We show that the production rate was highly sensitive to the amount of sublimed ferrocene. When the sublimed temperature was increased from 60 to 80 \u00b0C, the yield of the products were enhanced with the augment of ferrocene introduced into the reaction area, while the quality of the DWNTs was worsening synchronously. The optimal temperature of the sublimed catalyst was found at range of 65\u201370 \u00b0C. In our efforts to regulate the preparation conditions, we have tried to optimize the catalysts by adjusting its composition. But it was found that the catalyst composition by replacing the partial ferrocene with cobaltocene was inappropriate [26] . Although the functional mechanism of sulfur is complex, we believe that neither the selective poisoning of sulfur on the catalytic surface nor the Fe\u2013S eutectic theory can give a certain explanation. 3.1.3 Morphology of the as-grown SWNTs nonwoven We modified the experimental set-up by fitting a smaller, special quartz tube diameter of 10 mm into the outer quartz tube (35 mm i.d.). And methane was used as carbon resource in this experiment. After growing for 6\u20139 h, the products were peeled off as large pieces of nanotube texture from the wall of the quartz tube, which was defined as SWNTs nonwoven [28] . Fig. 4 (a) shows the optical image of the as-grown nonwoven. The area of the SWNT nonwoven can reach several tens of cm 2 , which is not previously reported. These large-piece SWNT nonwoven can be handled and manipulated easily, suggesting that these nonwoven is more attractive for practical applications in composite materials. SEM images of the nonwoven are shown in Fig. 4 (b) and (c). It appears from Fig. 4 (b) that the as-grown SWNT nonwoven is composed of the highly entangled carbon nanotubes bundles, decorated with very small diameter nanoparticles. The SWNT nonwoven is of compact structure, in which carbon nanotubes bundles range from several hundreds to thousands square micrometer. High Resolution TEM image ( Fig. 4 (d)) show that these entangled carbon nanotubes bundles are almost composed of SWNTs. The diameter of these carbon nanotubes among the bundles is about 1\u20132 nm. These carbon nanotubes are generally assembled into bundles with the diameter of \u223c30 nm, which firmly entangled among the nonwoven. The nanoparticles in nonwoven are iron catalysts encapsulated by several graphite layers. After purification, most of the iron particles are effectively removed ( Fig. 4 (c)). The compact structure of the nonwoven was maintained during purifying process, indicating that our purification method is effective and less destructive. 3.1.4 Morphology of well-aligned SWNTs structure For obtained orientational SWNTs, we used post-growth method with SWNTs nonwoven as well as in situ growth method under electric field. In the latter method, we deposited well-aligned isolated SWNTs or bundles on the metal electrodes patterned on the SiO 2 /Si surface through floating catalyst CVD method under ac electric fields at relatively low temperature (280 \u00b0C). And the patterned metal (Ta/Pt/Ta/) on SiO 2 /Si wafer was prepared for applying electric field by photolithography and lift-off technique (shown in Fig. 5 (a)). Fig. 5 (b) shows that SWNTs grown under ac electric field (20 V, 300 KHz) for five minutes were well-aligned and perpendicular to the edges of two adjacent electrodes. In the mean time, we tried both ac and dc electric fields in the experiments and found only ac electric fields were effective for the alignment of SWNTs. As to the post-growth method, well-aligned single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) structure with area of several tens of microns has been fabricated from SWNTs nonwoven by mechanical notching and heat treatment. The fabrication of well-aligned SWNTs structure included three processes. Firstly, the purified SWNTs nonwoven, which were easily attached to substrate were spread on a pre-cleaned glass slide or other smooth substrates. Secondly, the SWNTs films were nicked carefully using a sharp tip to generate some notches, which could be used as the local landmarks to find exact position. Finally, this pretreated SWNTs films on the glass slides were kept in an electric furnace at 200 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere for about 24 h. A general view of the aligned SWNTs structure is shown in Fig. 5 (c) and (d). It is observed that the SWNTs films near to the notch is pulled well aligned under the shrinking force between the both sides of the notch during the heat treatment process. Generation of the aligned SWNTs in this process can be likened to shear a nonwoven-cloth, in which process cloth fibers are tight and aligned in the tearing breach. The notch can be used as distinct local landmarks to position the laser spot on aligned SWNTs, as shown between two black lines in Fig. 5 (c). The area of well-aligned SWNTs can be as large as 8\u00d78 \u03bcm 2 , which is easy to be found by an optical microscope. Fig. 5 (d) shows the high magnification image of the well-aligned bundles with significantly straight and long nanotubes. These SWNTs bundles with diameter 20\u201330 nm are parallel to each other with about \u223c100 nm distance. The comparative high density aligned SWNTs can offer a very high efficiency to excite obvious Raman signal without employing previous surface-enhancement techniques. 3.2 Raman scattering measurements 3.2.1 Raman scattering characterization of SWNTs and DWNTs Micro-Raman spectra, especially the radial breathing mode (RBM), can be effectively employed to study the properties of SWNTs and DWNTs. Fig. 6 shows micro-Raman spectra for an as-grown SWNTs film, measured with a laser excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm. The Raman spectra consist of two main groups of peaks. The first group includes the peaks at 137, 166, 187, 223, 266 cm \u22121 , which consists of the radial breathing modes whose frequencies depend on the SWNT's diameters (insert in Fig. 6 (a)). According to the relation between diameter and frequency ( \u03c9 RBM =223.75/ d (nm)) [37] , the SWNT's diameter in the measured sample is at range of 0.84\u20131.63 nm, which agrees with the HRTEM observation. In the second peak group of high frequency, as seen in Fig. 6 (a), the peaks at 1573 and 1594 cm \u22121 are related to the E 2g graphite mode. The D-line around 1344 cm \u22121 is very lower compared with G-line (1594 cm \u22121 ), which indicates that the amount of amorphous carbon in the sample is very small. On the other hand, micro-Raman scattering was performed on the as-grown samples of DWNTs measured with a laser excitation wavelength of 632.8 nm ( Fig. 6 (b) and (c)). Similar to that of SWNTs, the DWNTs Raman spectrum in the range of 100\u20132000 cm \u22121 also shows two \u2018fingerprint\u2019 modes, that is, the tangential mode (TM) with a splitting peak (1554 and 1594 cm \u22121 ) and the radial breathing mode (RBM) in the low frequency range (insert in Fig. 6 (b) and (c)). It is worth noting that the RBM frequencies of DWNTs take a wider Raman frequency range (100\u2013400 cm \u22121 ) and display much richer peaks than that of SWNTs (insert in Fig. 6 (a)). A DWNT can be considered as two coaxial SWNTs coupled by Van der Waals interaction. The interaction may lead to some mixed Raman vibrational modes [38] . However, we consider that the weak van der Waals interaction may not significantly affect the basic vibration of the outer and inner tubes compared with that of their SWNT counterparts. Therefore, RBM Raman bands of DWNTs can be identified according to the basic rules of that of SWNTs [39] . Considering the thinnest inner diameter 0.4 nm and the interlayer spacing between the outer and the inner tube, we assume that the RBM peaks higher than 210 cm \u22121 might be originated from the inner tubes, while peaks at the lower frequency might be originated from the outer tubes or the larger inner tubes. Therefore, it is an interesting work to arrange a definite diameter value to the inner or outer tube. In reference [29 and 30], we assigned the possible match of the inner and outer tubes according to the diameter dependence of the RBM frequency of DWNTs. On the other hand, we determined the pair type of DWNTs from the diameter and chirality dependence of the interband energies and found that the inner and outer tube of DWNTs can be any chirality pairs, which validated the assumption of theories [40] . 3.2.2 Temperature dependence of resonant Raman scattering in DWNTs and SWNTs In further studies of Raman scattering, we investigated the temperature-dependent frequency shift of resonant Raman spectra of DWNTs [31] . In our experiment, Raman scattering was taken on the as-grown DWCNT film by a Renishaw microscopic confocal Raman spectrometer (RM2000). The 632.8 nm line of a He\u2013Ne laser was used as the excitation. A 20\u00d7objective lens and a low laser power of \u223c1 mW were used to avoid laser heating. The spatial resolution of the Raman instrument is 1 cm \u22121 . The DWCNT samples were kept in a hot/cold stage that was placed under the microscope of the Raman system. The sample temperature was tuned in the range of 78\u2013650 K by liquid-nitrogen flowing or electric heating. As expected, with increasing temperature, the frequencies of the Raman peaks, including RBM and GM, downshift simultaneously (shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b)). We carried out the peak separations of the Raman bands using multilorentzian lines and investigated the Raman shift of several RBM peaks with temperature, which is shown in Fig. 7 (c) and (d). It is found that RBM peak relative to carbon nanotube with the larger diameter has the larger frequency downshift. In here, we ascribed this downshift of the Raman shift to the temperature dependence of the C\u2013C stretching force constant. It is indicated that the decreased force constant may be due to the softened C\u2013C bond with increasing temperature and the temperature dependence of the force constants is smaller for the small diameter carbon nanotubes, which will have the smaller Raman frequency downshift with increasing temperature. 3.2.3 Polarized Raman scattering Characterization of isolated and Well-aligned SWNTs Polarized Raman spectra of the well-aligned SWNTs were recorded at room temperature using a micro-Raman spectrometer (JY-T64000) fitted with a charge coupled device detector (CCD). A 100\u00d7microscope objective was used for focusing of the laser beam and collection of the scattered light. The 488 nm ( E l =2.54 eV) laser excitation of Ar ion laser was provided and total power to the sample was filtered down to 40 \u03bcW over 1\u20132 \u03bcm laser spot. All Raman spectra were taken in backscattering configuration, with the incident-light polarization parallel (VV) or perpendicular (VH) to the scattering-light polarization. To obtain the VH signal, the scattered light was rotated by \u03bb /2 plate, keeping the same scattered-light polarization direction in the grating and in the CCD. A motorized x\u2013y stage and a rotational stage were used to rotate the aligned SWNTs angle ( \u03b8 a , between the SWNTs axis and the incident excitation polarized) in the horizontal plane with respect to the electric vector of the linearly polarized excitation from 0 to 90\u00b0. Typical polarized Raman spectra of the well-aligned SWNTs are presented in Fig. 8 . The Raman spectra with different angles \u03b8 a between the polarization of the incident light and the nanotube axis were recorded with VV configuration ( Fig. 8 (a)). It is found that all Raman peaks exhibit a dramatically decrease in intensities as \u03b8 a varies from 0 to 90\u00b0. Furthermore, all Raman modes with VV configuration reach maximum intensities when the polarization of the incident light is parallel to the nanotube axis ( \u03b8 a =0\u00b0), while nearly no signal can be detected when the polarization of the incident radiation is perpendicular to the nanotube axis ( \u03b8 a =90\u00b0). Fig. 8 (b) shows the orientation-dependence of the polarized Raman spectra of the well-aligned SWNTs recorded with VH configuration. Obviously, with the increase of the \u03b8 a , the intensities of all Raman modes increase and go through a maximum at \u03b8 a =45\u00b0 and then decrease symmetrically at \u03b8 a =90\u00b0. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Raman spectra for the two complementary angles show similar intensities. The angular dependence of Raman intensity is ascribed to the resonance enhancement in the Raman spectra of SWNTs and an orientation dependence of the absorption response for the resonance, which can be explained in terms of the depolarization effect (\u2018antenna effect\u2019) [41\u201343] . Due to the strong anisotropic geometry of the carbon nanotubes, the interband optical transitions from the valence band to the conducting band near the Fermi level can observed only for polarization parallel to the tube axis of SWNTs. It is predicated by the resonant Raman theory that a dramatic decrease in the Raman intensities of perfect SWNTs alignment for nanotubes oriented perpendicular to the excitation polarization. As for VV configuration in our experiment, when the polarization of the incident radiation is perpendicular to the nanotube axis ( \u03b8 a =90\u00b0), the Raman intensities of the well-aligned SWNTs are smaller than those of \u03b8 a =0\u00b0 by a factor of \u223c250, which is about 50 times than previous report [44] . On the other hand, the comparatively weak RBM intensities with VH configuration in here are due to the degenerate vibrations of the E modes (shown in insert of Fig. 8 (a) and (b)), which are reported previously [45 and 46]. For direct comparison to the theoretical intensity predictions and previous experimental results, relative Raman intensities in here are fitted with particular functions. Fig. 3 (a) and (b) show the angular dependence of the relative Raman intensities of the peaks at 1592 cm \u22121 (tangential stretching G-band mode) normalized to their maximum intensities for VV and VH measurements, respectively. It is observed that the angular dependence can be fitted well with cos 4 ( \u03b8 a ) function (dashed line in Fig. 8 (c)) for VV intensities, while sin 2 ( \u03b8 a ) cos 2 ( \u03b8 a ) function (dashed line in Fig. 8 (d)) for VH intensities. These results are in excellent agreement with resonant theoretical assumption and previous experimental results [45] . It is confirmed that the angular dependence of Raman intensities for VV and VH validate well the predication of the resonant theory due to perfect SWNTs alignment used in our experiment [46] . 3.3 Mechanical measurements of the samples Due to the macroscopic area of SWNT nonwoven, we measured the values of E and failure strength of nonwoven by directly pulling the as-grown and purified nonwoven with a special tensile puller, which is discussed in reference [28] . The special stress\u2013strain puller we used was once employed by Pan et al for measuring the Young's modulus ( E ) and tensile strength ( \u03c3 b ) of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) by pulling very long aligned nanotube ropes [47] . Fig. 9 (a) and (b) are typical stress\u2013strain curves, which can determine the E value for the original and purified nonwoven, respectively. The apparent Young's Modulus of the original nonwoven was \u223c0.188 TPa, while that of the purified nonwoven was \u223c0.139 TPa. With the free volume in the nonwoven considered, the real Young's Modulus could reach up to 0.7\u00b10.27 TPa, while that of the purified nonwoven was calculated as to be 0.5\u00b10.19 TPa. We ascribed the high Young's Modulus to these SWNT nonwoven's special structure and good graphitization. Therefore, the Young's modulus in our experiment is consistent with the theory prediction and the measurements results [48] . In our experiment, the special compact structure and firmly entangled connection is beneficial to the effective transfer of loading. As another reasons, these entangled nanotubes of nonwoven are grown in relatively high temperature (1100 \u00b0C), which result in well graphited and few defects. On the other side, the failure strengths for the original and purified nonwoven are \u223c144 and \u223c107 Mpa, respectively (calculated from the maximum stress in Fig. 9 (a) and (b). In our tensile experiment, we found two main processes, the elastic elongation of the entangled nanotubes bundles and the slippage between the aligned nanotubes bundles, occurred subsequently during loading force on the samples [49] . Therefore, the relatively low breakage values measured in our tests were mainly attributed to the slippage between the aligned nanotubes bundles, as opposed to real breakage of individual nanotubes. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have reported that: (i) Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) without amorphous carbon coating were prepared by thermally decomposing acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) at the temperature range of 750\u20131200 \u00b0C in a floating iron catalyst system. The C 2 H 2 partial pressure was controlled to make a carbon supply-limiting growth of SWNTs. The higher reaction temperature above 1100 \u00b0C seemed not to favor the SWNT production due to the quick thermal decomposition of C 2 H 2 . (ii) Double-wall carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) were mass-produced by pyrolizing C 2 H 2 at the temperature range of 900\u20131100 \u00b0C on a floating iron catalyst with sulfur promoted. It is indicated that the growth of DWNTs was strongly dependent on the sulfur addition, and without sulfur only SWNTs were produced. The effect mechanism of sulfur to the growth of DWNTs was discussed. (iii) After developed the experimental set-up, tough SWNTs nonwoven with area up to several tens square centimeters was prepared directly by pyrolizing CH 4 at the temperature \u223c1100 \u00b0C. The SWNT nonwoven exhibits extremely high Young's Modulus of ca. 0.4\u20130.7 TPa, which has potential applications in mechanical reinforcement of composite materials. (iv) Similar to that of SWNTs, Raman scattering by DWNTs has been experimentally shown to be a resonant process. The possible match of the inner tubes and the outer tubes according to the RBM bands was assigned, and different chirality types were discussed according to the diameter and chirality dependence of resonant Raman vibration. Otherwise, the temperature dependent frequency shift of resonant Raman spectra of DWNTs are investigated in the range of 78\u2013650 K. We found that different radial breathing mode (RBM) peaks, which are relative to different tube diameters, have different temperature coefficient of frequency shift. The larger diameter carbon nanotubes have more RBM frequency downshift with increasing temperature. We attribute the RBM frequency variation to the temperature dependence of the stretching force constant of C\u2013C bond. (v) Polarized Raman spectra recorded with VV and VH geometry are performed on well-aligned SWNTs fabricated from SWNTs nonwoven to detect the polarization and nanotubes orientation dependence of the Raman intensity. The angular dependence of Raman intensity is consistent with the predictions of the theory (\u2018antenna effect\u2019) and further confirms the resonance Raman model of the well-aligned SWNTs.

        "abstract": "Ni5Zn21 alloy nanowires were fabricated through template-assisted electrochemical deposition method. The morphology and microstructures of as-deposited nanowires were determined by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), electron diffraction (ED), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The accurate composition was measured via induced coupling plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. SEM results show that Ni5Zn21 nanowires are deposited in most of the nanopores of the template, and they are continuous and dense throughout the whole length. The XRD result demonstrates that the nanowires are mainly composed of a cubic gamma phase Ni5Zn21 alloy, but there also exists a trace of Zn-rich eta phase. HRTEM and ED reveal that the alloy nanowires are polycrystalline with the crystallite size of several tens of nanometers. EPMA of a single nanowire illustrates that there exist Ni-rich microzones in as-deposited nanowires. Subsequent magnetic measurements of the array also confirmed the existence of them. In addition, it can be further inferred that the shape of Ni-rich microzones is probably barlike or disklike, from the anisotropy of zero field cooling/field cooling (ZFC/FC) curves as well as the vortex magnetization behavior of the Ni5Zn21 nanowire array. The low-temperature magnetoresistance of the Ni5Zn21 nanowire array was also measured. Giant magnetoresistance instead of anisotropic magnetoresistance is suggested to be responsible for contributing to the magnetoresistance.",

For all such potential devices, controlling the size, morphology, and interparticle spacing of the nanoparticles is very important. Here, we combine seed-mediated growth with nanosphere lithography to study the controllable growth of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), in which the self-assembly monolayer of polystyrene (PS) on a silicon surface is used to guide the modification of alkanesilanes and the subsequent adsorption of gold seeds; seed-mediated growth is applied to controlling the morphology and size of Au NPs. The size of adsorption region (determining the number of adsorbed gold seeds) is controlled by etching PS microspheres with oxygen plasma or annealing PS microspheres at the glass transition temperature. The size and morphology of the Au NPs are controlled by changing growth conditions. In such a way, we have achieved the dual control of the obtained Au NPs. Preliminary results show that this strategy holds a great promise. This approach can also be extended to a wide range of materials and substrates. \u00a9 2006 Chin. Phys.

A low turn-on electric field of 1.05 V/\u03bcm is required to reach an emission current density of 10 \u03bcA/cm2. An emission current density of 10 mA/cm2 is obtained at an operating electric field of 1.88 V/\u03bcm. No current saturation is found even at an emission current of 5 mA. With the vacuum gap increasing from 1 to 10 mm, the turn-on field decreases monotonically from 1.21 to 0.68 V/\u03bcm, while the field amplification is augmented. The good field-emission behaviour is ascribed to the combined effects of the intrinsic field emission of SWNT and the waved topography of the nonwoven. \u00a9 2006 Chin. Phys.

        "abstract": "Here we report a novel single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) based bimorph electromechanical actuator, which consists of unique as-grown SWNT films as double electrode layers separated by a chitosan electrolyte layer consisting of an ionic liquid. By taking advantage of the special hierarchical structure and the outstanding electrical and mechanical properties of the SWNT film electrodes, our actuators show orders-of-magnitude improvements in many aspects compared to previous ionic electroactive polymer (i-EAP) actuators, including superfast response (19 ms), quite wide available frequency range (dozens to hundreds of Hz), incredible large stress generating rate (1080 MPa/s), and ultrahigh mechanical output power density (244 W/kg). These remarkable achievements together with their facile fabrication, low driving voltage, flexibility, and long durability enable the SWNT-based actuators many applications such as artificial muscles for biomimetic flying insects or robots and flexible deployable reflectors.",

Here, we design a new multifunctional carbon nanotube (CNT) based capacitive strain sensors which can detect strains up to 300% with excellent durability even after thousands of cycles. The CNT-based strain gauge devices exhibit deterministic and linear capacitive response throughout the whole strain range with a gauge factor very close to the predicted value (strictly 1), representing the highest sensitivity value. The strain tests reveal the presented strain gauge with excellent dynamic sensing ability without overshoot or relaxation, and ultrafast response at sub-second scale. Coupling these superior sensing capabilities to the high transparency, physical robustness and flexibility, we believe the designed stretchable multifunctional CNT-based strain gauge may have various potential applications in human friendly and wearable smart electronics, subsequently demonstrated by our prototypical data glove and respiration monitor.",

Atomic sheets containing hybridized bonds involving elements B, N and C over wide compositional ranges could result in new materials with properties complementary to those of graphene and h-BN, enabling a rich variety of electronic structures, properties and applications. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of large-area atomic layers of h-BNC material, consisting of hybridized, randomly distributed domains of h-BN and C phases with compositions ranging from pure BN to pure graphene. Our studies reveal that their structural features and bandgap are distinct from those of graphene, doped graphene and h-BN. This new form of hybrid h-BNC material enables the development of bandgap-engineered applications in electronics and optics and properties that are distinct from those of graphene and h-BN.",

        "abstract": "We report on the current-carrying capability and the high-current-induced thermal burnout failure modes of 5-20 \u03bcm diameter double-walled carbon nanotube (DWNT) fibers made by an improved dry-spinning method. It is found that the electrical conductivity and maximum current-carrying capability for these DWNT fibers can reach up to 5.9 \u00d7 10(5) S m(-1) and over 1 \u00d7 10(5) A cm(-2) in air. In comparison, we observed that standard carbon fiber tended to be oxidized and burnt out into cheese-like morphology when the maximum current was reached, while DWNT fiber showed a much slower breakdown behavior due to the gradual burnout in individual nanotubes. The electron microscopy observations further confirmed that the failure process of DWNT fibers occurs at localized positions, and while the individual nanotubes burn they also get aligned due to local high temperature and electrostatic field. In addition a finite element model was constructed to gain better understanding of the failure behavior of DWNT fibers.",

Recent studies indicate that h-BN atomic layers would be excellent dielectric layers to complement graphene electronics. Graphene on h-BN has been realized via peeling of layers from bulk material to create G/h-BN stacks. Considering that both these layers can be independently grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of their precursors on metal substrates, it is feasible that these can be sequentially grown on substrates to create the G/h-BN stacked layers useful for applications. Here we demonstrate the direct CVD growth of h-BN on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and on mechanically exfoliated graphene, as well as the large area growth of G/h-BN stacks, consisting of few layers of graphene and h-BN, via a two-step CVD process. The G/h-BN film is uniform and continuous and could be transferred onto different substrates for further characterization and device fabrication.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) thin films with thicknesses on the order of hundreds nanometers on glass substrates and a graphene thin film (2-3 layers) on a glass substrate are characterized via terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The substrate permittivity is first characterized. The thin film is then treated as a surface boundary condition between the substrate and air. Using the uniform field approximation, the surface conductivities of these films are extracted. To improve accuracy, precise thickness of the sample substrate is calculated through an iteration process in both dielectric constant extraction and surface conductivity extraction. Uncertainty analysis of the measured thin-film properties is performed. The SWNT results show consistent surface conductivities for samples on different substrates and with different film thicknesses. The measured graphene terahertz conductivity is comparable to the values reported in the literature at dc and optical frequency. This characterization method has been successfully applied as a means to evaluate metallic content of SWNT samples to verify a metallic SWNT removing process using high-power microwave irradiation.",

An improved algorithm for largest Lyapunov exponent was put forward for rapid identification of chaos in traffic flow. The chaos in traffic flow on an expressway was investigated with the improved algorithm and the power spectrum method. The power spectrums of the time series of the traffic flow were illustrated. Through the analysis of the power spectrums of the distance headway, it is clear that there are the variations of noise and wide apices. The largest Lyapunov exponents of the time series of the traffic flow were computed and used to identify the chaos in the traffic flow on the expressway.

        "abstract": "Patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) tend to be older and have a high co-morbidity burden. The impact of co-morbid conditions and sociodemographic risk factors on outcomes in these patients has not been quantified. We evaluated 445 consecutive outpatients with HFpEF, defined as established diagnosis of heart failure (HF) with left ventricular ejection fraction at presentation\u2009>40% and no previous left ventricular ejection fraction \u226440%. Patients with specific cardiomyopathies, congenital heart disease, primary right-sided disease, valvular disease, or previous advanced HF therapies were excluded. After 2 years, there were 44 deaths and 609 all-cause hospitalizations; of these, 260 (42.7%) were cardiovascular hospitalizations, including HF, and 173 (28.4%) were specifically for HF. The highest attributable risk for hospitalizations was associated with marital status (single, divorced, and widowed had higher hospitalization rates compared with married patients), hypoalbuminemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and renal dysfunction. The proportion of hospitalizations potentially attributable to these factors was 66.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 56.4 to 74.4) for all-cause hospitalizations, 76.9% (95% CI 65.2 to 84.6) for cardiovascular hospitalizations, and 83.0% (95% CI 70.3 to 90.3) for HF hospitalizations. For composite end points, the proportion was 46.9% (95% CI 34.0% to 57.3%) for death or all-cause hospitalization, 45.7% (95% CI 29.3% to 58.2%) for death or cardiovascular hospitalization, and 43.7% (95% CI 24.2% to 58.2%) for death or HF-related hospitalization. In conclusion, among outpatients with HFpEF, most hospitalizations could be attributed to co-morbidities and sociodemographic factors. Effects of HF therapies on hospitalizations and related end points may be difficult to demonstrate in these patients. Multidisciplinary approaches are more likely to impact hospitalizations in HFpEF.",

        "abstract": "The mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of the tree frog  (16,473 bp) was previously reported as having the unusual characteristic of lacking the ND5 gene. In this study, a new mitogenome of  (19,952\u00a0bp) was resequenced using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) and standard Sanger sequencing technologies. It was discovered that the ND5 gene was not lost but translocated to the control region (CR) from its canonical location between the ND4 and ND6 genes. In addition, a duplicated control region was found in the new mitogenome of this species. Conservative region identification of the ND5 gene and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the ND5 gene was located between two control regions. The phylogenetic relationship among 20 related species of anura revealed a rearrangement of the ND5 gene during the evolutionary process. These results also highlighted the advantages of next-generation sequencing. It will not only decrease the time and cost of sequencing, but also will eliminate the errors in published mitogenome databases.",

The Chinese populations of L. kahli also exhibit differences with other populations in terms of the body size and the number of right ciliary rows. The characteristics of L. rostrum are consistent with those of previous studies except for the number of right ciliary rows (9\u201310). The studied species were redefined based on the new information and previous descriptions. This study also gave a brief morphological summary of the species in the genus Loxodes by an identification key.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In an attempt to characterize the permanent deformation behavior of hot mix asphalt (HMA) under a more realistic loading condition, this study developed a multi-sequenced repeated load (MSRL) test. Comparing to conventional repeated load (RL) test, there are three characteristics for this new test. First, the loading scheme, containing a pre-loading sequence with stress level of 0.7\u202fMPa and other 25 sequences involving stress levels from 0.6\u202fMPa to 1.0\u202fMPa, was self-defined by the test design function of UTM-25. Second, the number of repeated loading in each sequence was fixed, with 500 times in pre-loading and 50 times in every other sequence. Third, two new indicators, including compound average strain rate (CASR) and compound creep stiffness modulus (CCSM), were proposed to evaluate the rutting-resistant property of HMA. Both MSRL test at different loading orders and RL test under stress levels of 0.7\u202fMPa and 1.0\u202fMPa were conducted on three types of mixtures with two binders at temperature of 60\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. The findings indicate that the effects of loading order are insignificant on the permanent deformation of HMA in secondary stage. Besides, average strain rate (ASR) has a nonlinear growth as stress level increases. Based on MSRL test results, coefficient of variance for new indicators is satisfactory. Through analysis of variance, it is also found that new indicators, with much reduced levels of confidence, have much better potentials to statistically differentiate mixtures with different SBS modified binders than conventional ones like flow number (FN), FN index and so on.",

Herein, multifunctional WS2 @polyetherimide (WS2 @PEI) nanoplatform has been designed and constructed for gene-photothermal synergistic therapy of tumors at mild condition. After a surface modification of WS2 with a positively charged PEI, the as-prepared WS2 @PEI nanoplatform can not only act as an efficient survivin-siRNA carrier for GT but also exhibit remarkable near-infrared (NIR) photothermal effects for PTT. On the one hand, the photothermal effects induced by WS2 @PEI upon NIR irradiation can enhance the cellular uptake owing to the increase of the cell membrane permeability, which leads to the remarkable enhancement of silencing efficiency of survivin. On the other hand, the silencing of survivin can increase the apoptosis as well as reduce the heat resistance of cancer cells by downregulating the heat shock protein 70 expressions, which greatly enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to PTT. As a result, compared to PTT or GT treatment alone, WS2 @PEI mediated synergistic GT/PTT therapy remarkably enhances in vitro cancer cell damage and in vivo tumor elimination.",

An implicit finite difference method is used in solving the diffusion equations, which has no numerical convergence problems, and the Jiles-Atherton model is used to obtain an accurate hysteresis loop of the core. The improved model predicts the performance of the magnetic switch quite well. It is then used to analyze the detailed dynamic saturation process of a core, and the core's saturation time predicted by the model is consistent with the experimental data, the error being less than 5%. Furthermore, the interlamination electric field is calculated and analyzed, and it is predicted that breakdown is most likely to occur at the inner side of the core and at the edge of the lamination.",

The generator is composed of a conventional Marx generator, an LC filter and a metal-oxide varistor (MOV) in parallel with the load. The Marx generator and the filter form a two-section type-A Guillemin pulse forming network (PFN). The PFN outputs a near square waveform and the MOV further stabilizes the voltage because of the MOVu0027s nonlinear resistivity. Circuit simulation verifies the working principle. Design parameters for the conventional PFN are derived. Considering the stray inductance of the filter, a more realistic PFN circuit is proposed and its parameters are derived. Preliminary experiments are conducted and verify the concept. Typical output waveforms have 20-30-ns rise time, 1000-1100-ns pulsewidth, and ~7-kV peak voltage. The pulse generator based on this concept is suitable to be used as a compact, long-pulse high power microwave modulator as it has a simple design, a well-defined flat top and it can output near constant voltage even if the loadu0027s impedance varies.",

        "abstract": "Metal\u2013oxide varistor (MOV) is a kind of special ceramic which can be used for square pulse forming based on its nonlinear electrical characteristics. The square pulse forming concept based on MOV has been explored and shows a good prospect in the miniaturization of the pulsed power systems. Circuit simulations are usually necessary to verify the forming effect before experiments. This brief describes a new high-voltage equivalent circuit model of MOV, the determination of the model parameters, and its implementation in PSpice. Two test experiments based on single chip MOV and multiple MOVs in series were carried out to test the new model, and the simulation and experiment results showed good consistency. This new model can be applied in further simulation studies of the square pulse forming based on MOV, for example, to improve the efficiency of the experiments.",

The proposed AMS has advantage of high power level, high repetitive rate capability, long lifetime achievability, and electrical parameters tunability, which meets the growing requirements of the military and industrial application of pulsed power technology. Adjustment of the electrical parameters of magnetic switch is achieved by altering the number of windings via the modification of the joint points between the AMS and the main circuit. Specifically, basic principle of the AMS is analyzed based on characteristics of the magnetic switch. Detailed design considerations are described for achieving modification of the winding's number ranging from 1 to M (positive integer larger than 1), which is limited by the insulation density, easily and reliably. In order to verify the design, two typical electrical parameters of an AMS are numerically calculated and simulated by the circuit simulation software. Accordingly, a test experiment platform was setup in our laboratory and the primary experimental study demonstrates that the AMS can successfully alter the electrical parameters with results similar to the calculation. A typical (1 - cos \u03c9t) pulse with rise times of 4 and 5 \u03bcs, a peak voltage of approximately 20 kV, and a peak current of over 1.0 kA was achieved on the capacitor load. The experimental results show reasonable agreement with the theoretical and numerical analyses.",

        "abstract": "Coalbed methane (CBM) development faces many challenges, among which in situ stress and permeability are two of the most important and fundamental factors. Knowledge of the characteristics of these factors is crucial to CBM exploration and development. Based on measured injection/falloff and in situ stress well test data of 55 CBM wells in the eastern margin of the Ordos Basin, correlations between parameters including initial reservoir pressure, in situ stress, lateral stress coefficient, well test permeability, and burial depth were determined. The distribution of in situ stress was analyzed systematically and its influence on permeability was also addressed. The results indicate that the maximum horizontal principal stress (\u03c3 H 10.13\u201337.84 MPa, average 22.50 MPa), minimum horizontal principal stress (\u03c3 h 6.98\u201326.88 MPa, average 15.04 MPa) and vertical stress (\u03c3 v 12.30\u201335.72 MPa, average 22.48 MPa) all have positive correlations with coal burial depth. Stress ratios (\u03c3 H/\u03c3 h, \u03c3 H/\u03c3 v, and \u03c3 h/\u03c3 v) and lateral stress coefficient slowly attenuated with depth. With increase of horizontal principal stresses, coal reservoir permeability (0.01\u20133.33 mD, average 0.65 mD) decreases. The permeability variation is basically consistent with change of stress state at a certain burial depth, the essence of which is the deformation and destruction of coal pore structures under the action of stresses. Three types of stress fields exist in the area: in the shallow coal seam at burial depths   \u03c3 v u003e \u03c3 h), with average permeability 0.89 mD; from 700 to 1000 m depths, there is a stress transition zone (\u03c3 H \u2248 \u03c3 v u003e \u03c3 h) with average permeability 0.73 mD; in the deep coal seam with burial depths u003e1000 m, the vertical principal stress is dominant, demonstrating a normal stress regime (\u03c3 v u003e \u03c3 H u003e \u03c3 h) with average permeability 0.11 mD.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Macrolithotypes control the porosity and permeability heterogeneity in coal reservoirs, influencing coalbed methane (CBM) production. The traditional method of macrolithotype determination relies on coal cores, but these are expensive and often have limited availability. Geophysical logging data is far more common but few studies have evaluated coal macrolithotypes using these data. Here 57 macrolithotype samples from 16\u00a0wells (coal cores) informed the relationship between coal macrolithotypes and select logging parameters. The ash yield and density of coal increased while the vitrinite content, pores and fractures reduced from bright coal to dull coal, correspondingly the density (DEN) and natural gamma (GR) logging value gradually increased, while the acoustic time difference (AC) and deep lateral resistivity (LLD) logging value gradually reduced. Most of the macrolithotype identification could be achieved with regional or block specific density cut-off values however, to distinguish between semi-bright and semi-dull a combination of GR and AC values were utilized. The logging evaluation method for coal macrolithotype identification was used to determine their distribution from 67 drilled wells in the Hancheng Block. From that data it was possible to distinguish the macrolithotype vertical distribution and block macrolithotype thickness contour maps for three seams. There was considerable variability in coal thickness and macrolithotype distribution. The greater contribution was typically from the combination of dull, semi-dull, and semi-bright macrolithotypes. The dull coal macrolithotypes often had contributions adjacent to the top and bottom of the seam mudstones. For all of the seams the bright coal contribution was low, and when present occurred in elongated lenses. From the regional contour maps, the semi-bright, semi-dull, and dull coals were well distributed. The macrolithotypes variation reflects the inputs and depositional environment transformations. Here the contribution is mainly from dry peat marsh and the living water peat marsh facies. Incorporation of macrolithotype heterogeneity will aid in reservoir characterization and CBM development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The fluid velocity sensitivity (FVS) effect in coal reservoirs affects the production of coalbed methane (CBM) wells by generation of coal fines. In this work, coal samples from Baode Block, northeastern Ordos Basin were made into coal cores for FVS analysis under different initial permeabilities, injection volumes and injection intensities. Standard brine with a mineralization degree of 8% (the mass ratio of NaCl: CaCl 2 : MgCl 2 \u00b76H 2 O=7.0:0.6:0.4) was chosen as the driving fluid. Also, the production responses of CBM wells to FVS at different stages of drainage were discussed. The results show that there is a critical flow velocity for the generation of coal fines. Below this critical flow velocity, coal fines can discharge with fluid, which increases the reservoir permeability. Over this critical flow velocity, FVS tends to occur in coal reservoirs, which blocks the effective seepage paths and reduces reservoir permeability. Additionally, the larger the flow velocity and injection volume are, the greater the permeability damage rate is. But the increasing rate of permeability damage slows down, revealing that the damage of FVS to permeability mainly occurs in the initial period of coal fines migration. Moreover, abrupt increase of flow velocity can damage reservoirs and give rise to massive coal fines generation. During the drainage process of CBM wells, the FVS effect is mainly affected by the dropping rate of working fluid level at the stage of single-phase water. There exists a period of massive coal fines generation when the working fluid level first drops near the coal seam. In the stage of two-phase gas and water, the deposition rate of coal fines is faster and the migration distance is shorter than that in the stage of single-phase water. Due to the difficulty of coal fines discharge, the FVS effect tends to occur in this stage. In the stage of single-phase gas, the gas flow can make coal fines agitate partially. But the FVS effect is relatively weak as coal matrix shrinkage can improve the reservoir permeability to a large degree.",

Meanwhile, the hydraulic fracture (e.g. the fracture length, width, and orientation) was also monitored by microseism. The results indicate that, by the OM and SEM, the B and SB coals usually have higher microfracture density accompanied by the better connectivity than that of the SD and D coals. But the latter are dominated in the Hancheng Block and some of microfractures were filled by the layered calcite and pyrite. Meanwhile, the microfracture fractal dimension of the B and SB coals are larger than the SD and D coals. By reconstructions of microfracture system by the NMR and X-CT, it is further verified that the development of microfracture decreases from the B to D coal, which results the hydraulic fracturing is necessary for enhancing CBM recovery in the Hancheng Block. The monitoring of hydraulic fracture shows that the orientation of the major fracture is general NE, the length is\u00a0u003e\u00a0100\u00a0m, and the height is usually larger than the coal thickness which indicates the hydraulic fracture extension is unrestricted by coal macrolithotypes and the formation mechanism is very different from the natural microfracture. These above observations aid in understanding the fracture system heterogeneity of the coal macrolithotypes on the refinement efficiency of the CBM exploration and development (e.g. reservoir optimization and reasonable fracturing).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Fracture system identification of coal reservoirs plays a vital role in evaluating favorable zone of coalbed methane (CBM) development and improving CBM well productivity. In order to identify the fracture system of the No. 2 coal reservoir, and to determine the productivity differences of CBM wells with different coal structures in the Yanchuannan (YCN) Block, Ordos Basin, China, a comprehensive analysis method from macroscopy to microscopy and from static to dynamic was provided in this work. Site observations on coal sections and observations under light microscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were combined to understand the fracture characteristics of the coal seam, and the spatial geological model of fracture development was built. The selected logging data was conducted cluster analysis to identify the coal structures of coring wells and to predict the coal structures of non-coring wells. The analysis results show that the No. 2 coal seam has a high fracture development degree, and is dominated by type II coal structure (cataclastic coals). The coals with different structures show evident zonation on the plane, which is largely controlled by faults. The well-developed fracture system and high permeability zone mainly concentrate on the tectonic rolling areas and the areas with small faults. Furthermore, the output data of coal fine and the drainage curves of CBM wells were performed dynamic analysis to indirectly reflect the fracture system difference and the resulting productivity difference. The results indicate that the wells with poor-preserved coals tend to produce more coal fine, and the gas production has a negative correlation with coal fine amount. The productivity pattern of CBM wells can be divided into \u201chigh yield\u2014long-term stable yield\u201d and \u201clow yield\u2014decline quickly\u201d. Almost all CBM wells with type I coal structure and most CBM wells with type II coal structure have the first productivity pattern, and part wells with type II coal structure and all wells with type III coal structure present the second productivity pattern.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to determine the origin of Carboniferous-Permian (C-P) coal measure gas and Ordovician weathered crust gas, and their gas-filling modes, the chemical and isotopic compositions of the natural gas along with the co-produced groundwater from Paleozoic in the Yanchuannan (YCN) gas field of the Ordos Basin, China, were analyzed. It was found in this work that the gas in the upper gas group of weathered crust (O 1 m 5  1+2 ) reservoirs and the C-P gas had similar \u03b4 13 C 1  and \u03b4 13 C 3  compositions and they were less negative than those of the gas in the lower gas group (O 1 m 5  4 ). While all weathered crust gases had \u03b4 13 C 2  values that are more negative than the C-P gases. The O 1 m 5  4  gas and C-P gas had a very clear boundary in \u03b4DCH 4  value, while the O 1 m 5  1+2  gas had the \u03b4DCH 4  ranges intersecting with the two others. The C-P gas is inferred derived from coal measures. The O 1 m 5  1+2  gas near erosional valley-form is a mixture of coal-derived gas and marine sapropelic gas, and the remaining Ordovician gases are inferred to originate from marine sapropelic source rock. Both gases were characterized by secondary cracking gas, and thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) altered the chemical and isotopic composition of weathered crust gas to a lesser extent due to short TSR reaction time. The changes in water type and total dissolved solids from the Permian to the Ordovician and the D shift phenomenon of O 1 m 5  1+2  water, reveals the fluid vertical migration between the Upper and Lower Paleozoic. Coupled with geological evolution analysis, the ancient erosional valley-form and the surrounding solution cavities and fractures are inferred the main migration channels for coal-derived gas into weathered crust reservoir. Moreover, three vertical gas-filling modes are proposed, i.e., gas seepage in free phase, diffusion phase and water-solution phase, with the importance in descending order.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Deep coalbed methane (CBM) resource potential is enormous in China, and has become a new field for unconventional natural gas exploration and development. This work discusses the geological conditions (reservoir pressure, formation temperature and ground stress) of deep coal reservoirs in the Eastern margin of the Ordos Basin and their implication on CBM development. Various field test data of CBM wells, including injection/drawdown test data, well temperature test data, and hydraulic fracturing test data were collected from this work and literature to describe the geological conditions of the deep CBM in the study area. From the results, it is found that deep CBM in this area is characterized by high reservoir pressure, high formation temperature, and high ground stress. However, there are diverse geological particularities in the different depth range: (1) Having a wide range of pressure gradient, vast majority of coal reservoirs in the study area are under abnormally low-pressure state, which is more significant in deeper coal seams. (2) Due to the impact of surface runoff, the distribution of geothermal gradient is discrete when the burial depth is less than 700\u202fm, and relatively concentrated when the burial depth is greater than 700\u202fm. (3) In shallow coal reservoirs, ground stress is strongest in the horizontal direction; while in deep coal reservoirs, the strongest ground stress is in the vertical direction. Because of the complex geological conditions associated with deep burial, the balance between CBM adsorption-desorption-seepage and the rheological behavior of coal reservoirs is complex, which has significant influence on the exploration and development of deep CBM in the study area. High pressure in deep coal reservoir often leads a long inefficient desorption stage and a long draining and depressurizing process, which increases production costs. Moreover, the negative temperature effect on gas adsorption indicates that CBM content decreases with increasing depth in deep conditions, and thus the evaluation of deep CBM resources needs to be reconsidered. In addition, different stress states govern fracture patterns, and in deep environments, high ground stress greatly reduces the fracturing improvement of the coal reservoir and significantly affects the deep CBM development.",

However, few studies have investigated the characteristics of macrolithotypes across multiple length scales. Here, the macrolithotype description was performed for the No. 3, 5, and 11 coal seams in the Hancheng Block of Ordos Basin. The cleats were characterized by optical microscopy and X-ray computed tomography (CT) while pores and their connectivity were determined from mercury intrusion porosimetry, N 2  and CO 2  adsorption, and low field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of water saturated cores evaluated both cleats and pores. The CH 4  adsorption capacity of coal samples scraped from the surface of the macrolithotype layers was also determined. Dull lithotypes (semi-dull and dull) were dominant, followed by bright lithotypes (bright and semi-bright) in these seams. The bright lithotype coal has a higher microfracture density (averaging 339 microcleats per 9\u00a0cm 2 , \u03bcm\u2013mm), better connectivity, and a larger fractal dimension (averaging 1.7) from optical microscopy. The dull lithotype has a lower average microfracture density (272 microcleats per 9\u00a0cm 2 ) and a smaller fractal dimension (~\u00a01.6). This higher connectivity observation was consistent with X-ray CT observations and low field NMR of the water saturated cores (and the transition upon water removal from the fractures and larger pores). Also the ease of mercury injection from cores also supported higher connectivity in the bright lithotypes. Both the semi-bright and semi-dull lithotypes have equivalent pore proportions micro- to macropores and good apparent connectivity at the nm\u2013\u03bcm scale; despite mineral occlusions.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coal permeability is of great importance for coalbed methane (CBM) development from coal reservoirs. The abundant CBM resource in middle-low volatile bituminous coals in the eastern margin of Ordos Basin has necessitated study on seepage features of these coal reservoirs. In order to better understand the control mechanism of geological pressure and temperature on coal permeability, this paper systematically addressed the permeability behaviors of different middle-low volatile bituminous coals from eastern Ordos Basin with different gases (helium and nitrogen) under various pressures and temperatures. The results show that the permeability decreases exponentially over effective stress. Coals with a great proportion of macro- and mesopores have a higher permeability level and a faster permeability decreasing rate to effective stress than coals with micro- and transition pores in majority. Under a constrained state, the permeability decreases over temperature because of the interaction between thermal stress and interior stress inside coal body. When the temperature is quite high, the permeability sensitivity to effective stress or temperature weakens correspondingly. Due to distinct adsorption abilities, the permeability tested by nitrogen is smaller than that tested by helium and their difference decrease with the rise of temperature. Furthermore, the permeability changing rate caused by effective stress, matrix deformation and gas slippage were calculated to visualize the pressure and temperature effects on permeability behaviors. The gas slippage-induced permeability improvement, affected by the pore fluid pressure, temperature, coal permeability and gas properties, was deeply discussed.",

        "abstract": "The Hancheng block in the southeastern Ordos Basin is one of the earliest and the most important areas for coalbed methane exploration and development in China. However, there are significant production variations in different wells or even some adjacent wells in the Hancheng block. To reveal the reasons of production differences in such a small scale, further detailed studies of coalbed methane productivity in the Hancheng pilot test area, a precursor trial area in Hancheng block with mature, well-characterized coalbed methane reservoirs and long-term production database, were conducted. The influence of nine factors (including engineering and geological factors) on gas production was analyzed. By introducing the rough set theory, which is applicable to the vague, imprecise, and incomplete information system, this paper presents a method for quantitative evaluation of the influencing factors on gas production. The results indicate that there are certain distribution characteristics of productivity in Han...",

The model results showed that small pores have low T2 values, while large pores have high T2 values. Thus, different reservoir rocks, owing to their diverse pore structures, have different T2 distribution characteristics when water-saturation condition is 100%. NMR experiments with different reservoir rocks under different centrifugal speeds were performed. The comparison of pore structures and water movability in diverse rocks was analyzed based on the NMR experimental results. As centrifugal speed increased, water was progressively expelled from the rocks. There are significant differences in the declining in the water saturation and the area of T2 spectrum per unit volume (ST) of all the four samples. The water saturation declining in clastic rocks is higher than that of coals. Moreover, both T2 peaks of clastic rocks corresponding to small and large pores successively decrea...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coal has a heterogenous porosity that influences its specific surface area (SSA) and CH 4  adsorption and desorption. However, the pore size distribution obtained with N 2  adsorption is only reliable at pore sizes u003e2\u00a0nm omitting the important contribution of micropore ( 2  at 77\u00a0K and CO 2  at 273\u00a0K, respectively, to compared the adsorption pore structure characteristics of different coal ranks, seams, and macrolithotypes, which further revealed the influences of mesopore (2\u201350\u00a0nm) and micropore on CH 4  adsorption capacity at different pore sizes. The larger micropore total pore volume (TPV) contributes to the larger micropore SSA. As micropores are common and contribute extensively to most of the SSA (u003e99%) in these coals, a much better relationship exists between the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) SSA and CH 4  adsorption capacity (Langmuir volume). With the increase of the coal rank, the CH 4  adsorption capacity increases continuously and the DR SSA shows a tendency of first decreasing then increasing; at the same coal rank, from the bright to dull coal, the vitrinite content as well as the DR SSA and CH 4  adsorption capacity decreases; for the three main coal seams in the Hancheng mine area, the No. 11 coal has the largest DR SSA and CH 4  adsorption capacity followed by the No. 3 coal and No. 5 coal. With CO 2  adsorption, it is more significant than N 2  adsorption to accurately characterize the microscopic structure of coal and understand the gas adsorption mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A majority of coalbed methane (CBM) in coal reservoirs is in an adsorbed state. Under geological pressure and temperature conditions (beyond the critical region of methane), supercritical adsorption occurs between methane (CH 4 ) molecules and coal surface. In order to better characterize CBM supercritical adsorption behaviors, isothermal adsorption tests were conducted to simulate the adsorption under different reservoir pressures and temperatures. It is observed that the temperature influences adsorption behaviors little under low-pressure conditions but weakens the sorption capacity of coals under high-pressure conditions. Since the adsorption volume obtained from isothermal adsorption tests is Gibbs excess adsorption volume, it was transformed to the absolute adsorption volume which is essential for reliable gas-in-place estimates. A hypothesis was proposed that a maximum adsorption volume for a certain adsorbent exist in the limiting case of supercritical conditions. Based on this, the limiting adsorption model was built in reference to the Dubinin-Astakhov (DA) adsorption model and Henry dissolution law. Additionally, different energy varying trends (adsorption potential, adsorption space, reduction of surface free energy and isosteric heat of adsorption) over pressure and temperature indicate that the adsorption of CH 4  by coals is actually the attraction between CH 4  molecules and coal molecules and also a spontaneous process to reduce surface free energy of the system. The pressure and temperature exert an impact on sorption behaviors by controlling attraction forces or kinetic energy of adsorbate and adsorbent molecules.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, a series of laboratory experiments were performed to firstly analyze the characteristics of the pore structure in low-rank coal (R o  1000\u00a0nm), with a poor development of mesopores (100\u20131000\u00a0nm). The fractal features of adsorbed pores and seepage pores were defined and calculated using fractal dimensions D 2  (2.563\u20132.926) and D 4  (2.683\u20133.263), respectively. D 2  has a positive correlation with moisture content, while D 4  has a positive correlation with R o  and fixed carbon and a negative correlation with the volatile content. Both D 2  and D 4  have a weaker association with the ash yield and no apparent relationship with coal macerals, indicating that coal-forming materials and environments have little influence on the pore structure fractal characteristics. D 2  has a strongly correlation with the BET surface area (R 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.9026) and the average pore diameter (R 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.9841), again proving that D 2  can be used to characterize the pore structure fractal dimension of adsorbed pores. D 2  shows a negative correlation with the Langmuir volume (V L ), but no apparent relationship with the Langmuir pressure (P L ), indicating that the pore structure of absorbed pores has little effect on methane desorption during the process of CBM exploitation. D 4  has weak positive correlation with permeability. Overall, fractal analysis is beneficial for better understanding the pore structure, methane adsorbability and seepage ability of low-rank coal.",

Density functional theory (DFT) is used for the determination of pore structure parameters to ensure its accuracy. Results show that the pore shape in the Panguan area is mostly the semi-open pores with poor connectivity (e.g., wedge-shaped, cylindrical, and slit-shaped pores with one closed side). Only a small amount of the pores is in open shapes (e.g., slit-shaped pores or cylindrical pores with two ends open). For most of the coal samples, the PSDs of pores tested by LP-N2GA appear to...",

        "title": "Evaluation of pore development in different coal reservoirs based on centrifugation experiment",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Pore development in a coal reservoir is closely related to the coalbed methane (CBM) occurrence. Therefore, an experimental study on the properties and characteristics of coal pores is critical for CBM exploration and production. In this paper, capillary pressure data from six coal samples with coal ranks ranging from medium volatile bituminous to anthracite were obtained using centrifugation, which is fast, convenient, non-toxic and harmless compared with other experimental methods. The centrifugation capillary pressure curves can be classified into three types. Type A refers to the medium-low volatile bituminous with a wide platform on its capillary pressure curve, indicating the pores have a good connectivity. The fractal analysis show that the fractal structure of macro- and mesopores are more complicated than that of transition pores. Thus the pore structure has a good capacity for gas seepage. Type B and C refer to the semi-anthracite to anthracite with steeper capillary pressure curves, suggesting that they both contain large numbers of micropores. However, the maximum and average pore diameters of type B are larger than those of type C, indicating that type B has more macropores than type C. Therefore, type B has both gas flow and adsorption capacities, while type C is only favorable for methane storage. Mercury porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were also performed on the six samples to verify the results of centrifugation. The capillary pressure curves obtained using mercury porosimetry also indicate the three types of pore structures. The pore size distributions evaluated from mercury intrusion show a consistency with those from centrifugation. As the assessment of pore development using centrifugation is limited to quantity, SEM can help to visually reveal the genesis of pores in different types of coal reservoirs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The first coalification jump (FCJ) has a significant impact on low-rank coal reservoir heterogeneity, and is of great importance for coalbed methane (CBM) development. Here, a series of experiments were performed for 10 coal samples collected from eastern Junggar Basin, to compare the material composition, pore structure and adsorption capacity of lignite and candle coal. Contrast with the candle coal, the lignite has a higher inertinite content, larger pore volume, better connectivity, and greater specific surface area (SSA). During the process of FCJ, the polycondensation of coal molecules and the compaction of coal matrix occur, leading to a rapid decline of moisture, porosity and permeability, and the cell wall in the candle coal is badly crushed with clay minerals filled from optical microscopy. In general, the larger total pore volume (1.7\u2013300\u202fnm, measured by N 2  adsorption) contributes to the larger SSA. The SSA of candle coal mainly comes from the contribution of micropore ( 4  adsorption capacity tends to decrease from the lignite to the candle coal due to material composition difference. Low-field NMR was used to determine the pore and fracture system by analyzing the transverse relaxation time, which showed that only two obvious peaks could be identified in lignite and three peaks at about 0.25\u202fms, 30\u202fms and 200\u202fms are present in the candle coal. The fractal results indicate that the pore surface and complexity inside the coal increase gradually from lignite to candle coal. These observations could deepen awareness and understanding of low-rank coal reservoir heterogeneity and the influence of FCJ on reservoir property.",

Thus the conventional saturated water NMR method has challenges when applied to lignite (coal swelling, and fragmentation during the centrification process to remove the pore water. Here an improved experimental method for effective porosity is demonstrated for lignite. To prevent sample breakage, the cores were wrapped with a heat shrinkable plastic and kerosene replaced water as the saturated fluid. The kerosene low-field NMR signal and porosity relationship was established and demonstrated for lignites from the Lower Cretaceous Saihantala Formation in the Shengli coalbed reservoirs in the Erlian Basin of Inner Mongolia, China. The lignite had a relatively high total porosity of 37.2\u201347.0% and an effective porosity of 25.0\u201334.6%. Thus, from this and additional reservoir considerations, this area is likely conducive to the production of coalbed methane.",

The recognition of coal texture with drilled cores or mining seam observation is direct and effective methods, but both methods are expensive and impossible for unexplored coal seams. The cut-off values logging data were applied in a few coal basins while the method ignores the effect of different coal ranks and is complicated with blurry boundary. In this study, 174 coal cores data obtained from 18 CBM wells were correlated with their geophysical logging responses in northwestern Guizhou Province. Four well-logging curves of the caliper logging (CAL), densities (DEN), natural gamma (GR) and deep lateral resistivity (LLD) were chosen to analyze coal textures. With progressive damage of coal, both values of CAL and LLD gradually increase while the DEN and GR tend to decrease. The identification index was reconstructed by using the principal component analysis (PCA) to identify coal texture of different coal ranks to improve the qualities of coal texture identification and reduce multiple solutions. The logging evaluation method for coal texture identification were applied in multiple coal seams in western Guizhou Province to validate the prediction method of logging data. The results show that PCA is feasible tool to analyze coal texture with improving accuracy and the well logging identification coal texture is good consistency with core identification in different rank coal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The mechanical behavior of coal has an important influence on coal reservoir stimulation and the dynamic change of coal reservoir permeability during coalbed methane (CBM) production. Generally, coal is regarded as an elastic-brittle material, which is reasonable when the surrounding stress is small. However, with the increasing depth of CBM exploitation, the in-situ stress increases continuously, so the coal will inevitably show some plastic behavior. In this work, the typical low-rank bituminous coal from the Baode CBM block on the eastern margin of the Ordos Basin was selected to carry out uniaxial and triaxial compression tests under various confining pressures ( P  c ) for further investigation of mechanical behavior. The results show that, as a complex porous material, the coal samples have a series of deformation responses during the loading process, which can be classified into four phases. Both the yield stress ( \u03c3  y ) and the peak stress ( \u03c3  peak ) increase nonlinearly as  P  c  increases. Additionally, with increasing  P  c , the elastic modulus ( E ) increases at a decreasing rate, while the Poissonu0027s ratio ( \u03bd ) decreases at a decreasing rate. Moreover, a change from volumetric compressibility to dilatancy in the coal was clearly observed in the tests, and the stress at the onset of dilation ( \u03c3  d ) is also significantly influenced by  P  c . Finally, based on irreversible thermodynamics and empirical support, a coupled elastoplastic damage constitutive model for low-rank bituminous coal was established by introducing the non-associated plastic flow laws and the damage evolution rules; the numerical simulation result of the model is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. This model can be used for further investigation of the mechanical properties of coal reservoirs under different in-situ stress conditions during the exploitation of CBM.",

By the material balance method, the coal reservoir permeability change in different stages is quantitatively characterized. The characteristics and control mechanisms of change in coalbed permeability (CICP) during different production stages are concluded on five aspects, i.e., permeability trend variation, controlling mechanism, system energy, phase state compositions, and production performance. The study reveals that CICP is characterized by first decline, then recovery, and finally by increase and is controlled directly by effective stress and matrix shrinkage effects. Further, the duration and intensity of the matrix shrinkage effect are inherently controlled by adsorption and desorption features.",

The results show that two generations of fluid activity related to hydrocarbon generation can be identified in these areas. The type of paleo-formation water indicates that the coal-bearing formation in Zhjin area is more favorable for hydrocarbon preservation than that of Panxian area. Under the influence of the paleo-fluid, the coal reservoirs in Zhijin area have poor pores connectivity, which are unfavorable to the output of coalbed methane.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Based on the geological characteristics of hydrothermal fluid in the western Guizhou and eastern Yunnan regions, this paper discusses the geological mechanisms of hydrothermal fluid on the coalbed methane (CBM) system. From the perspective of hydrothermal fluid activity in the regional strata, we analyze the geological processes by which coalbed methane is enriched and accumulated in this region. Our results demonstrate that two stages of regional thermal fluid activity occurred in the western Guizhou and eastern Yunnan regions. In the earlier stage, calcium fluid acted as the carrier, but in the later stage, it was replaced by siliceous fluid with a small amount of calcium fluid. The former resulted from thermal cycling of fluid through the strata, and the latter was caused by injection of deeply sourced high temperature fluids. We propose three geological mechanisms by which hydrothermal fluid affected coalbed methane accumulation: stimulation for hydrocarbon generation, transformation for physical properties and fluid supercharging. The hydrothermal fluid impels coalbed methane to generate and migrate at high intensity; it also produces dense swarms of tubular pores that coincide with tectonic stress. As a result, the coal body is broken, and there are changes to the porosity and permeability of the coal. Pressure development in the regional gas reservoir depends on the intensity of the fluid effect and the differential leakage of fluid pressure in the coal reservoir. The relatively closed and stranded hydrothermal fluid environment of coal measure strata tends to lead to a high pressure coalbed methane system. The platform uplift in northwestern Guizhou is one such environment, in which the geological configuration of the high temperature fluid provided favorable conditions for the enrichment and accumulation of coalbed methane.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Shichanggou oil shale, located in the northern Bogda Mountain, on the southern margin of the Junggar Basin, was deposited in a Late Permian lacustrine environment. The concentrations of minerals and trace elements in selected oil shale samples from the Shichanggou area were measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Analyzed oil shale samples are characterized by high total organic carbon (TOC) contents (7.76\u201322.15%) and ash yields (49.35\u201370.73%) with oil yields from 3.92% to 13.8%.  Shichanggou oil shale samples are rich in SiO 2  (64.77%), followed by Al 2 O 3  (9.14%) and Fe 2 O 3  (4.19%). Compared with average shale composition (ASC) from Clarke and North American Shale Composite (NASC), analyzed oil shale samples are enriched in Ca (4.04%) and Mg (3.14%), especially P (0.69%). Al 2 O 3  correlates quite well with Fe 2 O 3 , K 2 O, Na 2 O, MnO, TiO 2 , Cu, Ba, Co, and Ni for their association with clay minerals. Besides, the significant correlations between Fe 2 O 3  and MnO, Co, Ni, Ti, Cr are considered to result from their similarity on geochemical behavior. All selected oil shales are characterized by distinctly sloping light rare earth elements (LREE) trends ((La N /Sm N  =2.33\u20133.61) accompanied by flat heavy rare earth elements (HREE) trends, with distinct Eu negative anomalies (0.58\u20130.74).  Discrimination diagrams based on geochemistry and some ratios of elements indicate that Shichanggou oil shales were deposited in deep water environments with warm-humid climates and anoxic conditions, and we believe the original sediments were consisted of felsic rocks from the west orogenic belt. Geochemical data for oil shales suggest a continental island arc setting. Together with regional geological evidence, the Shichanggou oil shales were deposited in a back-arc intracontinental basin.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Based on 232 sets of well-test results measured at depths from 135.9 to 1407.19\u00a0m in 15 coalbed methane (CBM) development blocks in China, correlations between parameters including reservoir pressure (P  o  ), shut-in pressure (P  c  ), breakdown pressure (P  f  ), in-situ stress, coal permeability, and depth ( D ) were determined. The distribution of in-situ stress in the eastern margin of the Ordos Basin (EMOB), southern Qinshui Basin (SQB), and western Guizhou province (WGP) were analyzed systematically, and its control on the coal reservoir permeability was also addressed. The minimum and maximum envelope curves of the stress ratio (including  k  (( \u03c3   H  \u00a0+\u00a0 \u03c3   h  )/2 \u03c3   v  )),  K   H   ( \u03c3   H  / \u03c3   v  ) and  K   h   ( \u03c3   h   /\u03c3   v  )) variability with depth was obtained using the Brown and Hoek (1978) method, and the average envelope curves were established by mathematical derivation on the condition that horizontal principal stresses increase linearly with depth.  The results show that the maximum principal stress ( \u03c3   H  ), minimum principal stress (\u03c3  h  ) and vertical stress (\u03c3  v  ) vary with depth and location. Generally, there are two main stress regimes in major coalfields in China:  \u03c3   H  \u00a0u003e\u00a0 \u03c3   h  \u00a0u003e\u00a0 \u03c3   v   (59.48%) and  \u03c3   v  \u00a0u003e\u00a0 \u03c3   H  \u00a0u003e\u00a0 \u03c3   h   (34.52%). The \u03c3  H  \u00a0u003e\u00a0\u03c3  h  \u00a0u003e\u00a0\u03c3  v   stress regime has the smallest proportion (6%), which appears mainly in relatively shallower coal seams ( k ,  K   H   and  K   h  , were plotted between two envelopes, which can be used to estimate the range of  \u03c3   H   and  \u03c3   h   at a certain depth. With increasing depths, three ratios decrease toward a fixed value, e.g.,  K   H  \u00a0\u2192\u00a00.86,  k \u00a0\u2192\u00a00.74, and  K   h  \u00a0\u2192\u00a00.6. For coal seams with a depth\u00a0u003e\u00a01000\u00a0m,  k  is generally  \u03c3   v   gradually becomes the dominant stress.  Coal reservoir permeability decreases exponentially with the increase in effective in-situ stress (EIS, ( \u03c3   H  \u00a0+\u00a0 \u03c3   h  \u00a0+\u00a0 \u03c3   v  )/3\u00a0\u2212\u00a0P  o  ). Vertically, four distinct vertical bands of coal permeability can be found in the EMOB, SQB and WGP, defined by the compression and deformation of the coal-matrix under certain stress regimes: in shallow coal seams (EMOB,  \u03c3   H  \u00a0u003e\u00a0 \u03c3   h  \u00a0u003e\u00a0 \u03c3   v  ) where  \u03c3   H   and  \u03c3   h   tend to increase, and coal permeability decreases exponentially with an increasing depth; in intermediate coal seams (EMOB, 800\u20131000\u00a0m; SQB, 650\u2013825\u00a0m; WGP, 500\u2013750\u00a0m), the  \u03c3   v  \u00a0u003e\u00a0 \u03c3   H  \u00a0u003e\u00a0 \u03c3   h   stress regime plays a major role, with relatively high coal permeability. For deep coal seams (EMOB, u003e\u00a0950\u00a0m; SQB, u003e\u00a0825\u00a0m; WGP, u003e\u00a0750\u00a0m), CBM development conditions deteriorate due to a state of \u201cextremely low permeability and extremely high in-situ stress\u201d.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Thick sequences of organic-rich lacustrine oil shale were deposited in the Middle Permian Lucaogou Formation of the Junggar Basin and the Santanghu Basin. The mineralogy and major, trace and rare earth element geochemistry of the oil shales and mudstones collected from the Lucaogou Formation are discussed. The chondrite-normalized patterns of the studied samples show LREE enrichments, HREE deficits, and generally negative Eu anomalies and positive Ce anomalies. The Paleoclimate indictor (C-value) varies between 0.08 and 0.62, reflecting generally arid to subhumid conditions. In addition, low Rb/Sr (with a mean value of 0.14) and high Sr/Cu (with a mean value of 33.22) values indicate that arid conditions prevailed during the deposition of the Lucaogou Formation. Sr/Ba ratios (0.31\u20137.73) of the studied samples suggest a paleoenvironment with variable salinity. The salinity of the lake is controlled by climate variations, freshwater replenishment, seawater intrusion, and redox conditions. The studied oil shales in the Lucaogou Formation are mainly derived from a felsic (dacite and rhyolite) to intermediate (andesite) source that formed in the Early Permian and mixed with small amounts of basic rocks (basalt). Volcanic eruptions provided the source rocks for the Lucaogou Formation. The chemical index of alteration (CIA), the plagioclase index of alternation (PIA), and an A-CN-K ternary diagram indicate that the parent rocks of the oil shale experienced weak to moderate chemical weathering.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Macrolithotypes control the pore-fracture distribution heterogeneity in coal impacting stimulation via hydrofracturing and the coalbed methane (CBM) production. Given that it is affected by the discontinuities, hydraulic fracture geometry is complex in the vertical plane and is different from a simple fracture in a homogeneous reservoir. However, the initiation and propagation mechanism in the vertical plane is unclear. To clarify this, the cohesive zone finite element approach, with macrolithotype contributions included, was used to simulate and analyze the hydraulic fracture propagation. The experimental tests showed that, the bright and semi-bright coal usually have higher microfracture (cleat) density accompanied by the lower mechanical properties than that of the semi-dull and dull coals. The behavioral differences are likely to impact the geometry evolution of hydraulic fractures and which appears to vary when fracturing the different coal macrolithtypes. Thus, the cohesive zone finite element approach was used with two models to capture macrolithotype impacts. The result show that, when fracturing the dull coal (model 2), the overall propagation region rapidly displayed a simple plane in shape because of the less development of natural fractures. With the influence of the larger elastic modulus, the high-stress zone would be easy formed and suddenly release to generate pressure pulse when the hydraulic fracture penetrated the interface. As the hydraulic fracture initiates from the bright coal (model 1), the presence of the existing diverse cleat network contribute greatly to the increase of cracks number to form complex fractures. However, the opening of natural fractures will lead to the diversion of fracturing fluid, and the larger elastic modulus of the interlayer also plays a limiting role in the height of the hydraulic fracture. In addition, the monitoring of hydraulic fracture was carried out and shown that the height of the major fracture in model 1 was restricted and limited by the bright coal; and the height in model 2 is usually larger than the dull coal thickness, indicating that the hydraulic fracture has cut through the fracturing section (dull coal) and embedded into the upper and lower layers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Macrolithotypes control the pore-fracture distribution heterogeneity in coal, which impacts stimulation via hydrofracturing and coalbed methane production in the reservoir. Here, the aspects of coalbed methane production that are impacted by macrolithotype were determined from production data from 56 wells in the Hancheng Block, China. The macrolithotype contribution had a significant influence on the well productivity, with dull lithotype-rich (dull and semi-dull coal) coal having significantly lower productivity than wells with bright lithotype-rich (bright and semi-bright coal) coal. The main reason for this difference is that macrolithotypes impart a fracture distribution, which further impacts the hydrofracture stimulation and subsequent coalbed methane production. Here, the hydraulic fracture was evaluated using the appropriate mechanical behavior for each macrolithotype with PFC 2D  software, and the impact of the macrolithotype on hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation, which are controlled by stress and mechanical properties, was investigated systematically. The result showed that the hydraulic fracture propagation types are controlled by the pre-existing natural fractures. Furthermore, due to the well-developed natural fracture network, the hydraulic fractures in bright coal were mainly composed of the opening, steering propagation, and compound types, forming a lattice-like fracture network. Dull coal is denser, and its hydraulic fractures are characterized as an isolated fracture distribution. The conclusions were verified through monitoring of hydraulic fracture by the microseism wells which show that the fracture in the bright coal is more likely to match the \u201ccomplex fracture network\u201d description, and the \u201csimple\u201d case when the dull coal is fractured. Meanwhile, the hydraulic fractures mainly open at a shallow depth, but with the increase in depth, the hydraulic fractures are dominated by the crossing type. If the hydraulic fractures are the opening type, only at a higher liquid pressure can the natural fractures in dull coal be initiated. Thus, the difference between hydraulic fractures in bright and dull coal lead to different flow paths and ultimately result in a variation of coalbed methane production. Therefore, during coalbed methane output, a bright coal reservoir will have more potential than a dull coal reservoir, which provides a scientific base for coalbed methane exploration and development.",

However, little information on aerosols in enclosed rabbit sheds was available. An FA-1 sampler was employed to collect air samples in an enclosed rabbit house in the Qingdao region of China. Concentration, composition, and aerodynamics of bacterial aerosols inside the enclosed rabbit shed were systematically analysed. The concentration of airborne bacteria inside the rabbit shed was 2.11-6.36\u00d7104 colony forming unit/m3 (CFU/m3). Seventeen species of bacteria belonging to eight genera were identified. Among these, there were 11 species belonging to 4 genera of gram-positive bacteria, and 6 species belonging to 4 genera of gram-negative bacteria. The dominant species of bacteria were, in descending order, Micrococcus luteus (49.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (25.5%), and Alcaligenes odorans (10.2%). A total of about 76.3% of airborne bacteria was distributed in stages C-F of the FA-1 sampler (that ranges from A to F), with aerodynamic radii u003c3.3 \u03bcm in diameter. These particulates could enter lower respiratory tracks and even alveoli, posing a potential threat to the health of both animals and breeders.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from outpatients in town hospitals of Shandong province, China. Antimicrobial susceptibility of ESBL-producing E. coli was tested using the disk diffusion and resistance genes encoding for \u03b2-lactamases (blaTEM, blaCTXM, and blaSHV) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multilocus sequence typing (ST) of ESBL-producing E. coli was analyzed in this study. Our results showed that of 320 E. coli isolates, 201 carried ESBL genes (201/320, 62.8\uff05), and these isolates all carried blaCTX-M genes, the most common being blaCTX-M-14 (116/201, 57.7\uff05), followed by blaCTX-M-55 (47/201, 23.4\uff05) and blaCTX-M-15 (31/201, 15.4\uff05). ESBL-producing E. coli exhibited highly resistant to penicillin derivatives, fluoroquinolones, folate pathway inhibitors, and third-generation cephalosporins, but no carbapenem-resistant isolates were found in this study. Forty-two STs were found among the 201 ESBL-producing E. coli, and the most common ST was ST131 (27/201, 13.4\uff05), followed by ST405 (19/201, 9.5\uff05) and ST69 (15/201, 7.5\uff05). Taken together, a high isolation rate of ESBL-producing E. coli (62.8\uff05) was found among outpatients in town hospitals. blaCTX-M gene was most dominant and was composed of a variety of subtypes. No dominant ST was detected among ESBL-producing E. coli, indicating that these ESBL-producing E. coli isolates derive from different clones.",

Four hundred and fifty weaned New Zealand male rabbits (6 wk old) were randomly divided into 3 equal groups (150 rabbits/group) and fed with a basal diet (control, digestible energy (DE): 15.92 MJ/kg and crude protein (CP): 19.24%) or the basal diet supplemented with 1 or 5 g of EUL/kg of diet (EUL1 and EUL5), in which the same quantity of barley meal was replaced. During the 21 d of experiment (43 to 63 d of age), the temperature and relative humidity of the rabbit house ranged from 27.5 to 32.5\u00b0C and from 65 to 73%, respectively. We analysed feed intake, growth performance and antioxidant status of growing rabbits. Compared with the control group, at the end of the experimental period, EUL supplementation significantly reduced the average daily feed intake (92.0, 92.8 and 100.7 g/d for EUL1, EUL5 and control, respectively; Pu003c0.05), improved the feed conversion ratio (3.80, 3.81 and 4.59 for EUL1, EUL5 and control, respectively; Pu003c0.05), increased the activities of glutathione peroxidase (+35.5 and +35.0% in plasma and liver of rabbits in EUL5 vs. control group, respectively; Pu003c0.05) and reduced those of malondialdehyde (\u201312.0 and \u201346.0% in plasma and liver of rabbits in EUL5 vs. control group, respectively; Pu003c0.05).

        "abstract": "In this study, we sought to evaluate the effects of dietary Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (B. amyloliquefaciens) BLCC1-0238 supplementation on laying performance, egg quality, antioxidant enzyme activities, reproductive hormone, and immunity of laying hens. A total of 240 Hy-Line Brown laying hens (28\u00a0weeks old) were randomly divided into four groups, and three replicates per group (n\u2009=\u200920 per replicate). The control group was fed a standard basal diet, and the three treatment groups were provided the basal diet supplemented with either 0.01%, 0.03%, or 0.06% B. amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0CFU/g), respectively. Hens were allowed 2\u00a0weeks to acclimate prior to initiation of the 8-week experiment. It was observed that dietary supplementation with 0.01% or 0.03% B. amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 significantly increased egg production and egg mass. However, no significant differences in feed intake, egg weight, and feed conversion ratio among the four groups were observed. Different levels of B. amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 supplementation also significantly increased egg shell strength and thickness. With respect to the levels of reproductive hormones in the hens, B. amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 supplementation significantly reduced serum adrenal cortical hormone (ACTH) levels, while increasing estradiol (E2) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion in the treatment groups compared to the control group. Relative to the control group, supplementation with 0.03% and 0.06% B. amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 was observed to significantly increase serum glutathione S-transferase (GST) concentration, and supplementation significantly reduced serum IL-1 and IL-6 levels, whereas IL-4 levels increased for all concentrations tested. In conclusion, supplementation of a basal chicken diet with B. amyloliquefaciens BLCC1-0238 can improve laying performance and egg quality through the reduction of stress responses, up-regulation of growth hormones, and supporting immunity in laying hens.",

The goal of our study was to investigate the prevalence and drug resistance characteristics of ESBL-EC in healthy broilers from Shandong Province. A total of 142 ESBL-EC isolates were collected from four prefectures in Shandong Province from October 2014 to February 2015. ESBL-EC isolates were frequently detected (142 of 160 samples, 88.8%) in healthy broilers. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that all 142 ESBL-EC isolates were resistant to ampicillin, piperacillin, and cefazolin but were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. All ESBL-EC isolates carried one or more of the bla genes, in which blaCTX-M, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-5 genes were identified in 142, 106, and 5 isolates, respectively. The...",

However, a systematic phylogenetic analysis of H9N2 AIV from chickens in Shandong of China has not been conducted. Based on hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences of H9N2 AIVs isolated from chickens in Shandong of China between 1998 and 2013, genetic evolution of 35 HA gene sequences was systematically analyzed in this study. Our findings showed that the majority of H9N2 AIVs (21 out of 35) belonged to the lineage h9.4.2.5. Most of isolates (33 out of 35) had a PSRSSR\u2193GLF motif in HA cleavage site. Importantly, 29 out of these 35 isolates had an amino acid exchange (Q226L) in the receptor-binding site. The substitution showed that H9N2 AIVs had the potential affinity to bind to human-like receptor. The currently prevalent H9N2 AIVs in Shandong belonged to the lineage h9.4.2.5 which are different from the vaccine strain SS/94 clade h9.4.2.3. Therefore, the long-term surveillance of H9N2 AIVs is of significance to combat the possible H9N2 AIV outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "In order to achieve enhanced and synergistic delivery of paclitaxel (PTX), a hydrophobic anticancer agent, two novel prodrug copolymers, POEG15-b-PFTS6 and POEG15-b-PFTS16 composed of hydrophilic poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (POEG) and hydrophobic farnesylthiosalicylate (FTS, a nontoxic Ras antagonist) blocks, were synthesized. Both POEG-b-PFTS polymers were able to form micelles with intrinsic antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Employing these micelles as a carrier to load PTX, their drug loading capacity, stability, in vivo biodistribution and tumor inhibition effect were evaluated. PTX/POEG15-b-PFTS16 mixed micelles exhibited an excellent stability of 9 days at 4 \u00b0C with a PTX loading capacity of 8.2%, which was more effective than PTX/POEG15-b-PFTS6 mixed micelles. In vivo biodistribution data showed that DiR-loaded POEG-b-PFTS micelles were more effectively localized in the tumor than in other organs. Moreover, both PTX/POEG-b-PFTS micelles showed significantly higher antitumor activity than Taxol in a 4T1.2 murine breast tumor model, and the tumor inhibition and animal survival followed the order of PTX/POEG15-b-PFTS16 > PTX/POEG15-b-PFTS6 > POEG15-b-PFTS16 > Taxol \u2248 POEG15-b-PFTS6. Our data suggest that POEG-b-PFTS micelles are a promising anticancer drug carrier that warrants more studies in the future. Statement of Significance Polymerization of drug-based monomer represents a facile and precise method to obtain well-defined polymeric prodrug amphiphiles. Currently, most reports largely focus on the synthesis methods and the biophysical properties. There is limited information about their anti-tumor activity and delivery function as prodrug carriers in vitro and in vivo. In this manuscript, we report the development of two novel prodrug copolymers, POEG15-b-PFTS6 and POEG15-b-PFTS16 composed of hydrophilic poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (POEG) and hydrophobic farnesylthiosalicylate (FTS, a nontoxic Ras antagonist) blocks. Both POEG-b-PFTS polymers were able to self-assemble into nano-sized micelles with intrinsic antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, POEG-b-PFTS polymers were effective in forming stable mixed micelles with various anticancer agents including PTX, DOX, docetaxel, gefitinib, and imatinib. Delivery of PTX via our new carrier led to significantly improved antitumor activity, suggesting effective PTX/FTS combination therapy. We believe that our study shall be of broad interest to the readers in the fields of biomaterials and drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "Two novel prodrug polymers POEG-b-PSSDas (redox-sensitive) and POEG-b-PCCDas (redox-insensitive), which consist of poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (POEG) hydrophilic blocks and dasatinib (DAS, an oncogenic tyrosine kinases inhibitor) conjugated hydrophobic blocks, were designed as dual-functional carriers for codelivery with doxorubicin (DOX). Both carriers retained antitumor activity of DAS and could form mixed micelles with DOX. Compared to POEG-b-PCCDas micelles, incorporation of disulfide linkage into POEG-b-PSSDas micelles facilitated efficient cleavage of DAS from prodrug micelles in tumor cells/tissues, leading to a higher level of anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, DOX-loaded POEG-b-PSSDas micelles exhibited triggered DOX release under a redox environment (10 mM glutathione, GSH), and demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity against 4T1.2 and PC3 cell lines compared to DOX and DOX-loaded POEG-b-PCCDas micelles. More importantly, DOX-loaded POEG-b-PSSDas micelles were more effective in inhibiting the tumor growth and prolonging the survival rate in an aggressive murine breast cancer model (4T1.2) compared to DOX-loaded POEG-b-PCCDas micelles and a micellar formulation co-loaded with DOX and DAS. This redox-responsive prodrug micellar system provides an attractive strategy for effective combination of tumor targeted therapy and traditional chemotherapy, which warrants further investigation.",

        "abstract": "We have previously improved the bioactivity of PEG5k-FTS2 system by incorporating disulfide bond (PEG5k-S-S-FTS2) to facilitate the release of farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (FTS).1 Later, fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) moiety has been introduced to PEG5k-FTS2 system (PEG5k-Fmoc-FTS2) in order to enhance drug loading capacity (DLC) and formulation stability.2 In this study, we have brought in both disulfide linkage and Fmoc group to PEG5k-FTS2 to form a simple PEG5k-Fmoc-S-S-FTS2 micellar system. PEG5k-Fmoc-S-S-FTS2 conjugate formed filamentous micelles with a \u223c10-fold decrease in critical micellar concentration (CMC). Compared with PEG5k-Fmoc-FTS2, our novel system exhibited further strengthened DLC and colloidal stability. More FTS was freed from PEG5k-Fmoc-S-S-FTS2 in treated tumor cells compared to PEG5k-Fmoc-FTS2, which was correlated to an increased cytotoxicity of our new carrier in these cancer cells. After loading Paclitaxel (PTX) into PEG5k-Fmoc-S-S-FTS2 micelles, it showed more potent efficiency in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation than Taxol and PTX-loaded PEG5k-Fmoc-FTS2. PTX release kinetics of PTX/PEG5k-Fmoc-S-S-FTS2 was much slower than that of Taxol and PTX/PEG5k-Fmoc-FTS2 in normal release medium. In contrast, in glutathione (GSH)-containing medium, PTX in PEG5k-Fmoc-S-S-FTS2 micelles revealed faster and more complete release. Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution study showed that our PEG5k-Fmoc-S-S-FTS2 system maintained PTX in circulation for a longer time and delivered more PTX to tumor sites with less accumulation in major organs. Finally, PTX-loaded PEG5k-Fmoc-S-S-FTS2 micelles resulted in a superior therapeutic effect in vivo compared to Taxol and PTX formulated in PEG5k-Fmoc-FTS2 micelles.",

        "abstract": "A structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) study was conducted using a series of PEGylated Fmoc-amino acid conjugates (PFA) as a simple model to gain more insight into carrier\u2013drug interaction. Among the eight PEG2000-Fmoc conjugates with different neighboring structures of Fmoc motif, PEG2000-Fmoc-Lys (Cbz) (PFA2)-based nanomicelles exhibited the smallest particle size distribution, lowest critical micelle concentration (CMC) value, and highest loading capacity with paclitaxel (PTX). These biophysical properties were largely attributed to the strengthened carrier\u2013carrier and carrier\u2013drug interaction, including \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding interaction, as confirmed by fluorescence quenching and 13C NMR study. In vitro and in vivo evaluation further demonstrated the effectiveness of PFA2 as a nanocarrier for efficient delivery of PTX to achieve improved antitumor activity. Importantly, PFA2 was also effective in formulating eight other model drugs of diverse structures, indicating a broad application potential. This work may shed insights into the molecular basis for the structural optimization of nanocarriers for improved delivery efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Ibuprofen (IBU) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which is widely used to reduce fever and treat inflammation and acute pain. Recently, its application in cancer treatment is also being explored. In this work, we synthesized a well-defined IBU-based amphiphilic diblock copolymer via reversible addition fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization of IBU-based vinyl monomer. The amphiphilic copolymer POEG--PVBIBU (denoted as POVI) was composed of a hydrophilic poly(oligo(ethylene glycol)) block and a hydrophobic IBU-bearing prodrug block, which was able to self-assemble into prodrug nanomicelles. In addition, it could serve as a carrier to co-load other drugs including doxorubicin (DOX), paclitaxel (PTX), and docetaxel (DTX). By using DOX as a model anti-cancer drug, the delivery function of POVI carrier, including the drug release,  cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and  antitumor activity, was evaluated. DOX-loaded POVI micelles exhibited sustained release of DOX. Besides, DOX/POVI micelles were effectively taken up by tumor cells with an efficiency comparable to that of free DOX. Moreover,  studies showed that POVI carrier itself had modest antitumor activity. After loading DOX, the antitumor activity was significantly increased, which was significantly higher than that of free DOX. Our results suggest that POVI polymer represents a simple and effective dual-functional carrier for co-delivery of IBU and DOX to improve the anticancer activity.",

        "abstract": "It is highly demanded and still a big challenge to develop an effective formulation for immunochemotherapy against advanced tumors. We have previously reported a PEG-NLG-based immunostimulatory nanocarrier (PEG2k-Fmoc-NLG919) for codelivery of an IDO1 inhibitor (NLG919) and a chemotherapeutic agent (paclitaxel, PTX). Although antitumor immune responses were enhanced with PTX-loaded nanocarrier, the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) was also significantly increased, which may limit the overall efficacy of therapy. In the present work, we developed an improved dual-functional nanocarrier (PEG5k-Fmoc-NLG2) to co-load PTX and sunitinib (SUN, a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for improved cancer immunochemotherapy. We found that the recruited MDSCs negatively impacted the overall antitumor activity of PTX-loaded PEG-NLG nanocarrier. Mechanistic study suggests that this is likely attributed to the PTX-mediated induction of a number of chemokines that are involved in the recruitment of MDSCs. We have further shown that the induction of these chemokines was drastically blocked by SUN. Codelivery of PTX and SUN via PEG5k-Fmoc-NLG9192 nanocarrier led to a further improvement in the therapeutic efficacy with a concomitant reduction in MDSCs.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy for cancers, we have developed a novel prodrug micellar formulation to co-deliver ceramide-generating anticancer agents and ceramide degradation inhibitor (PPMP). The prodrug nanocarrier is based on a well-defined POEG-b-PPPMP diblock copolymer. The hydrophilic block of POEG-b-PPPMP is POEG, and the hydrophobic block is composed of a number of PPMP units, which could work synergistically with loaded anticancer drugs. POEG-b-PPPMP was readily synthesized via a one-step reversible addition-fragment transfer (RAFT) polymerization from a PPMP monomer. The newly synthesized polymers were self-assembled into micelles and served as a carrier for several hydrophobic anticancer drugs including DOX, PTX and C6-ceramide. POEG-b-PPPMP prodrug polymer exhibited intrinsic antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, POEG-b-PPPMP prodrug polymer was comparable to free PPMP in selectively enhancing the production of pro-apoptotic ceramide species as well as down-regulating the mRNA expression of GCS. DOX-loaded POEG-b-PPPMP micelles exhibited an excellent stability of 42\u202fdays at 4\u202f\u00b0C. Moreover, DOX loaded in POEG-b-PPPMP micelles showed higher levels of cytotoxicity than DOX loaded in a pharmacologically inert polymer (POEG-b-POM) and Doxil formulation in several tumor cell lines. Consistently, in a 4T1.2 murine breast cancer model, the tumor inhibition followed the order of DOX/POEG-b-PPPMP\u202f>\u202fDOX/POEG-b-POM\u202f\u2265\u202fDoxil\u202f>\u202fPOEG-b-PPPMP\u202f>\u202fPOEG-b-POM. Our data suggest that POEG-b-PPPMP micelles are a promising dual-functional carrier that warrants more studies in the future.",

Gene transfection in both lungs and s.c. tumors was significantly higher with our polymer compared to PEI.

        "abstract": "Tumor microenvironment (TME) of a mature solid tumor is made of three components: tumor cell clusters or nests, stroma and immune cells. Most of the microvessels are located in the stroma, which is made of extracellular matrix and tumor associated fibroblasts (TAF). Circulating nanoparticles (NP) extravasating through the leaky microvessels first encounter the stroma and are taken up by TAF. SomeNPwill also penetrate through the stroma and reach tumor nests, depending on the particle size. In a stroma rich bladder cancer model, TAF are themajor cells taken up small LPC NP which contain ~80% cisplatin. Genome damaged TAF secrete Wnt16 which in a paracrine manner activates tumor cells for drug resistance and for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. It also induces neighboring naive fibroblast to become drug resistance and the endothelial cells to undergo angiogenesis. After repeated LPC administration, the bladder tumor becomes highlyWnt16 positive and highly drug resistant. Tumor rapidly regrows soon after LPC dosing is completed. Delivery of Wnt16 siRNA by LPH NP to the tumor can down-regulate Wnt16, inhibit the development of tumor drug resistance and enhance tumor growth inhibition by LPC. In advancedmurine B16F10melanoma, tumor does not contain a lot of stroma, and is relatively resistant to a nano-vaccine. LPH delivery of TGF\u03b2 siRNA, PLGA NP delivery of CDDO-Me (an anti-inflammatory) or Sunitinib (a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor), or PEGylated curcumin micelles, can all downregulate the Th2 type cytokines, inhibit Treg cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and enhance tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cells in the treated tumor. These immune modulators significantly enhance the tumor growth inhibition by a nano vaccine designed to boost the CTL response against the melanoma. Thus, we conclude that both siRNA and small molecule inhibitors can be delivered to modulate TME to facilitate either chemo or immune therapy, or both.

Herein, we reported the construction of a series of pH-sensitive micelles by conjugating the hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment to a hydrophobic farnesylthiosalicylate derivative, FTS-hydrazide (FTS-H), with a hydrazone linker, whose cleavability can be conveniently modulated by choosing various lengths of the carbon chain or appropriate electron-withdrawing groups with different steric environment around the hydrazone linker. We examined the hydrolysis rates of these pH-sensitive micelles in both neutral and acidic conditions. One of the pH-sensitive micelles (PHF-2) was found to be highly sensitive to acidic conditions while being fairly stable in neutral conditions. Furthermore, PHF-2 micelles well retained the antitumor activity of free FTS-H. We further evaluated the use of PHF-2 micelles as a carrier for delivering paclitaxel (PTX) and the triggered release of PTX under the acidic environment. PTX-loaded PHF-...",

        "abstract": "Liver X receptors (LXRs) were identified as receptors that sense oxidized cholesterol derivatives. LXRs are best known for their hepatic functions in regulating cholesterol metabolism and triglyceride synthesis, but whether and how LXRs play a role in the lung diseases is less understood. To study the function of LXRs in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we applied the oleic acid (OA) model of ARDS to mice whose LXR was genetically or pharmacologically activated. The VP-LXR\u03b1 knock-in (LXR-KI) mice, in which a constitutively activated LXR\u03b1 (VP-LXR\u03b1) was inserted into the mouse LXR\u03b1 locus, were used as the genetic gain-of-function model. We showed that the OA-induced lung damages, including the cytokine levels and total cell numbers and neutrophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the wet/dry weight ratio, and morphological abnormalities were reduced in the LXR-KI mice and wild-type mice treated with the LXR agonist GW3965. The pulmonoprotective effect of GW3965 was abolished in the LXR-null mice. Consistent with the pulmonoprotective effect of LXR and the induction of antioxidant enzymes by LXR, the OA-induced suppression of superoxide dismutase and catalase was attenuated in LXR-KI mice and GW3965-treated wild-type mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that activation of LXRs can alleviate OA-induced ARDS by attenuating the inflammatory response and enhancing antioxidant capacity.",

        "abstract": "The cholesterol sulfotransferase SULT2B1b converses cholesterol to cholesterol sulfate (CS). We previously reported that SULT2B1b inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis by antagonizing the gluconeogenic activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1). In this study, we showed that the SULT2B1b gene is a transcriptional target of HNF4\u03b1, which led to our hypothesis that the induction of SULT2B1b by HNF4\u03b1 represents a negative feedback to limit the gluconeogenic activity of HNF4\u03b1. Indeed, down-regulation of Sult2B1b enhanced the gluconeogenic activity of HNF4\u03b1, which may have been accounted for by the increased acetylation of HNF4\u03b1 as a result of decreased expression of the HNF4\u03b1 deacetylase Sirt1. The expression of Sult2B1b was also induced by HNF4\u03b1 upon fasting and the Sult2B1b null (Sult2B1b) mice showed increased gluconeogenic gene expression and elevated fasting glucose level, suggesting that SULT2B1b also plays a restrictive role in HNF4\u03b1 mediated fasting responsive gluconeogenesis. We also developed thiocholesterol, a hydrolysis-resistant derivative of CS, which showed more superior activity than the native CS in inhibiting gluconeogenesis and improving insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet induced diabetic mice. We conclude that the HNF4\u03b1-SULT2B1b-CS axis represents a key endogenous mechanism to prevent uncontrolled gluconeogenesis. Thiocholesterol may be used as a therapeutic agent to manage hyperglycemia.",

        "abstract": "Camptothecin (CPT) is a potent antitumor agent and functions via inhibiting the activity of topoisomerase I during DNA replication. However, the clinical application of CPT has been greatly hindered by its extremely poor solubility, the instability of its active lactone ring in blood stream, as well as the non-specific toxicity to normal tissues. In addition, most of the formulations developed so far are not applicable for formulating CPT. In this study, two novel CPT prodrugs were developed by conjugating CPT to \u03b1-tocopherol via a carbonate ester bond (CPT-VE) or disulfide linkage (CPT-S-S-VE). Both CPT prodrugs were able to self-assemble into nanofibers with the facilitation of a PEG5K-Fmoc-VE2-based nanomicellar carrier. Both prodrug nanoassemblies exhibited excellent stability. Fluorescence quenching, UV absorbance, and FT-IR studies demonstrated strong interactions between carrier and prodrugs, including hydrophobic interaction, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, as well as hydrogen bonding. NMR studies suggested that prodrugs were successfully incorporated into PEG5K-Fmoc-VE2 during self-assembly process. In vitro, PEG5K-Fmoc-VE2/CPT-S-S-VE presented significantly higher level of cytotoxicity on tumor cells compared to PEG5K-Fmoc-VE2/CPT-VE. Biodistribution study showed that CPT-S-S-VE formulated in PEG5K-Fmoc-VE2 micelles was effectively converted to parent CPT following delivery to tumor tissues. Finally, PEG5K-Fmoc-VE2/CPT-S-S-VE nanofibers showed superior tumor growth inhibition in an aggressive murine breast cancer model (4T1.2).",

        "abstract": "A simple PEGylated peptidic nanocarrier, PEG5000-lysyl-(\u03b1-Fmoc-\u03b5-Cbz-lysine)2 (PLFCL), was developed for effective co-delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and dasatinib (DAS) for combination chemotherapy. Significant synergy of DOX and DAS in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation was demonstrated in various types of cancer cells, including breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Co-encapsulation of the two agents was facilitated by incorporation of 9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and carboxybenzyl (Cbz) groups into a nanocarrier for effective carrier-drug interactions. Spherical nanomicelles with a small size of \u223c30 nm were self-assembled by PLFCL. Strong carrier/drug intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking was demonstrated in fluorescence quenching and UV absorption. Fluorescence study showed more effective accumulation of DOX in nuclei of cancer cells following treatment with DOX&DAS/PLFCL in comparison with cells treated with DOX/PLFCL. DOX&DAS/PLFCL micelles were also more effective than other treatments in inhibiting the proliferation and migration of cultured cancer cells. Finally, a superior anti-tumor activity was demonstrated with DOX&DAS/PLFCL. A tumor growth inhibition rate of 95% was achieved at a respective dose of 5 mg/kg for DOX and DAS in a murine breast cancer model. Our nanocarrier may represent a simple and effective system that could facilitate clinical translation of this promising multi-agent regimen in combination chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck are appearing with increased frequency in both marrow transplanted and non-transplanted Fanconi anemia (FA) patients. FA patients commonly display radiosensitivity of epithelial tissues, complicating effective radiotherapy. Fancd2 mice (C57BL/6J and 129/Sv background) demonstrate epithelial tissue sensitivity to single-fraction or fractionated irradiation to the head and neck and distant marrow suppression (abscopal effect), both ameliorated by intraoral administration of the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, GS-nitroxide, JP4-039. We now report that mice of two other FA genotypes, Fancg (B6) and the most prevalent human genotype Fanca (129/Sv), also demonstrate: 1. reduced longevity of hematopoiesis in long-term bone marrow cultures; 2. radiosensitivity of bone marrow stromal cell lines; and 3. head and neck radiation-induced severe mucositis and abscopal suppression of distant marrow hematopoiesis. Intraoral administration of JP4-039/F15, but not non-mitochondrial-targeted 4-amino-Tempo/F15 or F15 alone, prior to each radiation treatment ameliorated both local and abscopal radiation effects. Head and neck irradiated TGF-\u03b2-resistant SMAD3 (129/Sv) mice and double-knockout SMAD3 Fancd2 (129/Sv) mice treated daily with TGF-\u03b2 receptor antagonist, LY364947, still displayed abscopal bone marrow suppression, implicating a non-TGF-\u03b2 mechanism. Thus, amelioration of both local normal tissue radiosensitivity and distant marrow suppression by intraoral administration of JP4-039 in Fancg and Fanca mice supports a clinical trial of this locally administered normal tissue radioprotector and mitigator during head and neck irradiation in FA patients.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: A practical radiation mitigator must be safe in pregnant females. Irradiation during pregnancy can induce fetal death, stunt growth, and/or lead to teratogenic and carcinogenic effects dependent on stage of gestation. We evaluated the mitochondrial targeted GS-nitroxide mitigator JP4-039 for effects on total body irradiated (TBI) pregnant mice.  Methods: Timed pregnant C57Bl/6NHsd mice at E13 were irradiated to 3 Gy, subgroups were injected IV 24 hr later (E14) with JP4-039 in F14 emulsion (4 ug JP4-039 in 100 ul of F14). Mice were followed for number of pups born, weight of pups at day 5 after birth, and for number of survivors at time of weaning. In other studies of irradiation effects, new- born pups, on the day of delivery, were euthanized, fixed, sectioned and examined microscopically.  Results: Nonirradiated mice showed 97 \u00b1 2% of newborn surviving until weaning. Pups born to 3 Gy irradiated E13 pregnant mice had decreased survival (8.3 \u00b1 8.7%) (p   Conclusions: Treatment of total body irradiated E13 pregnant mice at E14 with JP4-039/F14 was safe and effective as a radiation mitigator, led to increased numbers of surviving newborns, improved growth and development, and after weaning over 21 days, and increased body weight with no late deaths.

        "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a major cause of intractable epilepsy in children however the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of FCD and FCD induced epilepsy remain unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that the large-pore ion channels, pannexin 1 (Panx1) and 2 (Panx2), are involved in epilepsy and brain development. In this study, we investigated the expression of Panx1 and Panx2 in surgical samples from patients with FCD type Ia (FCDIa), type IIa (FCDIIa), and type IIb (FCDIIb) and in age-matched autopsy control samples. We found Panx1 mRNA and protein levels were both increased in all these FCD samples. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Panx1 was mainly distributed in microcolumn neurons, dysmorphic neurons (DNs), balloon cells (BCs) and reactive astrocytes. Double-labeled staining showed that the Panx1-positive neurons were mostly glutamatergic DNs and occasionally GABAergic normal-appearing neurons. Importantly, the protein levels of Panx1 positively correlated with the frequency of seizures. Intriguingly, the Panx2 mRNA and protein levels were only upregulated in FCDIIb lesions and characteristically expressed on SOX2-positive multipotential BCs. Immunofluorescent experiments identified that Panx2-positive BCs mainly expressed the neuronal differentiation transcription factor MASH1 but not the immature glial marker vimentin. Taken together, our results established a potential role of the specific expression and cellular distribution patterns of Panx1 and Panx2 in FCD-associated epileptogenesis and pathogenesis.",

Because growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma (GH-PA) patients have a high incidence of diabetes frequently treated with metformin, we assessed the antitumor effect of metformin on GH-PA. We found that metformin effectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in the GH-PA cell line GH3. We detected a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), an increase in expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, and a decrease in expression of an anti-apoptotic protein in metformin-treated GH3 cells, which suggests involvement of the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway. Inhibition of AMPK, which is activated by metformin, failed to reverse the antiproliferative effect. ATF3 was upregulated by metformin, and its knockdown significantly reduced metformin-induced apoptosis. In addition, GH secretion was inhibited by metformin through suppression of STAT3 activity independently of AMPK. Metformin also significantly suppressed cellular proliferation and GH secretion in primary human GH-PA cells. Metformin also significantly inhibited GH3 cell proliferation and GH secretion in vivo. ATF3 upregulation and p-STAT3 downregulation were confirmed in xenografts. These findings suggest metformin is a potentially promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of GH-PA, particularly in patients with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Metabolic abnormalities are common in cancers, and targeting metabolism is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach to cancer management. Pituitary adenoma (PA) is a type of benign tumor. Impairment of tumor cells' metabolism in PA seems not to be as apparent as that of other malignant tumor cells; however, aberrant hormone secretion is conspicuous in most PAs. Hormones have direct impacts on systemic metabolism, which in turn, may affect the progression of PA. Nowadays, conventional therapeutic strategies for PA do not include modalities of adjusting whole-body metabolism, which is most likely due to the current consideration of the aberrant whole-body metabolism of PA patients as a passive associated symptom and not involved in PA progression. Because systemic metabolic abnormalities are presented by 22.3%-52.5% PA patients and are closely correlated with disease progression and prognosis, we propose that assessment of metabolic status should be emphasized during the treatment of PA and that control of metabolic abnormalities should be added into the current therapies for PA.

        "abstract": "Bromocriptine, the most commonly used dopamine (DA) receptor agonists for prolactinoma, can effectively reduce tumor size of prolactinoma, but the mechanism was not fully understood. Apoptosis had been well-recognized to contribute to the tumor mass regression caused by bromocriptine. However, whether other types of non-apoptotic cell death involved in the bromocriptine-induced prolactinoma shrinkage had not been fully clarified. The newly discovered molecular mechanism of necroptosis provides the possibility to examine this programmed necrosis in the pharmacological function of bromocriptine. The aim of present study was to evaluate and investigate the underlying mechanism of necroptosis in involution of prolactinoma induced by bromocriptine. By immunohistochemistry, we found that the numbers of receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3(RIP3) and phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL)-positive cells and their expression intensities were increased in patients with prolactinoma after bromocriptine therapy. For further exploring the mechanism of bromocriptine, prolactinoma cell line (MMQ cells) was adopted to study the mechanism of necroptosis in vitro. Cell viability and ATP level of MMQ cells were decreased, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was increased after bromocriptine treatment. The above effects could be partially reversed by Necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of necroptosis. Ultrastructural study further confirmed the necroptosis of MMQ cells, which was characterized by ruptured membrane, dissolved cytoplasm and especially the dramatically swollen mitochondria. Furthermore, we demonstrated that bromocriptine induced RIP3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis of prolactinoma cells and phosphoglycerate mutase family 5(PGAM5)/ Cyclophilin D (CypD) pathway was involved. The results suggested that necroptosis might be a promising target for clinical therapy for prolactinoma.",

        "abstract": "Cortical tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are highly associated with intractable epilepsy. Recent evidence has shown that transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) has direct effects on both neurons and glial cells. To understand the role of TRPV4 in pathogenesis of cortical tubers, we investigated the expression patterns of TRPV4 in cortical tubers of TSC compared with normal control cortex (CTX). We found that TRPV4 was clearly up-regulated in cortical tubers at the protein levels. Immunostaining indicated that TRPV4 was specially distributed in abnormal cells, including dysplastic neurons (DNs) and giant cells (GCs). In addition, double immunofluorescent staining revealed that TRPV4 was localized on neurofilament proteins (NF200) positive neurons and glial fibrillary acidic portein (GFAP) positive reactive astrocytes. Moreover, TRPV4 co-localized with both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, protein levels of protein kinase C (PKC), but not protein kinase A (PKA), the important upstream factors of the TRPV4, were significantly increased in cortical tubers. Taken together, the overexpression and distribution patterns of TRPV4 may be linked with the intractable epilepsy caused by TSC.",

However, the relationship between virus and pituitary adenomas (PAs) remains unknown. Here, we investigated infection status of three types of viruses (HPV16, HHV6B and HSV1) and expression level of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in 60 human PA samples. We also determined the role of TLR3 signaling pathway on a PA cell line (GH3). We firstly found that positive rates of HPV16 and HHV6B infection were significantly higher in invasive PA samples than in noninvasive samples (P\u00a0u003c\u00a00.01). Similarly, TLR3 mRNA and protein expression also increased in invasive PA samples (P\u00a0u003c\u00a00.01). In\u00a0vitro analysis indicated that GH3 cell proliferation and survival were enhanced by TLR3 activation, which was accompanied by NF-\u03baB activation. Our data indicate that HPV16 and HHV6B viruses may be involved in promoting the progression of PA by activating the TLR3 signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "SummaryAimFocal cortical dysplasia (FCD) represents a well-known cause of medically intractable epilepsy. Studies found that transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 4 (TRPV4) may participate in the occurrence of seizures. This study investigated the expression patterns of TRPV4 in FCD and the cascade that regulate functional state of TRPV4 in cortical neurons.MethodsThirty-nine surgical specimens from FCD patients and 10 age-matched control samples from autopsies were included in this study. Protein expression and distribution were detected by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. Calcium imaging was used to detect the TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx in cortical neurons.Results(1) The protein levels of TRPV4 and of an upstream factor, protein kinase C (PKC), were markedly elevated in FCD. (2) TRPV4 staining was stronger in the dysplastic cortices of FCD and mainly observed in neuronal microcolumns and malformed cells. (3) The activation of TRPV4 was central for [Ca2+]i elevation in cortical neurons, and this activity of TRPV4 in cortical neurons was regulated by the PKC, but not the PKA, pathway.ConclusionThe overexpression and altered cellular distribution of TRPV4 in FCD suggest that TRPV4 may potentially contribute to the epileptogenesis of FCD.",

An integer-encoding population based incremental learning algorithm (IEPBIL) is presented to tackle the problem above, where an elitism preservation scheme and a mutation operation are devised.

        "abstract": "We experimentally investigated the generation of high-energy electron beams from laser-driven wakefield acceleration in argon gas jets by using tens of terawatt 30 fs ultrafast laser pulses that were focused to a relatively large-spot size, unmatched with the laser\u2013plasma parameters. In this interaction, and depending on the Ar gas jet density, we could distinguish two different regimes for electron acceleration in the argon medium. In the high-density argon gas jet where argon clusters are formed, upon interaction with the laser electron beams having as high a charge as 3nC are generated. However, the energy spectra of those electron beams were continuous. On the other hand, high-quality quasi-mono-energetic electron beams with a modest charge of tens of pC are observed at much lower argon gas jet densities. The generation of such a high-quality electron beam is attributed to the ionization injection mechanism in which the electron injection takes place over only a few hundred micrometers of the laser\u2013plasma interaction length, leading to the generation of high-quality electron beams.",

The laser pulses generating the plasma are ultra-fast (30 femtoseconds), ultra-intense (tens of Terawatt) and are focused on a helium gas jet to generate relativistic electron beams via the laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) mechanism. A probe laser beam (\u03bb = 800 nm) which is split-off the main beam is used to cross the plasma at the time of arrival of the main pulse, allowing online plasma density diagnostics. The interferometer setup is based on the NoMarski method in which we used a Fresnel bi-prism where the probe beam interferes with itself after crossing the plasma medium. A high-dynamic range CCD camera is used to record the interference patterns. Based upon the Abel inversion technique, we obtained a 3D density distribution of the plasma density.",

For a plasma formed from helium-nitrogen gas mixture and depending on the concentration of the nitrogen gas, we could distinguish a clear trend for the quality of the generated electron beams in terms of their peak energy, energy-spread, divergence angle, and beam charge. The results clearly showed that the lower the nitrogen concentration, the better the quality (higher peak energy, smaller energy spread, and smaller emittance) of the generated electron beams. The results are in reasonable agreement with two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations.",

        "abstract": "Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) is a plasma-based electron beam accelerator technology that can deliver electron beams with energies up to several GeVs, depending mainly on the power of the used laser system and the electron injection scheme. Here, we present the results from a GeV electron accelerator with a high reproducibility and a charge up to 30 pC using 110\u2013120-TW laser pulses and by employing the well-established self-truncated ionization injection (STII) mechanism. These electron beams can be further used via bremsstrahlung in high-Z solid materials for the generation of gamma-rays and positron beams, therefore, composing a compact radiation source for various applications. Here, we use the Monte Carlo simulation code \u201cGeant4\u201d for studying the properties of those radiations. As expected, the characteristics of the generated gamma-rays and positron beams showed a strong dependence on the incident electron beam, target material, and thickness. The trend of positrons and gamma-rays energies and yield is shown for different high-Z to low-Z targets with the same areal mass density. Thicknesses of the target material in terms of its radiation length have been varied periodically in order to find the optimal thickness for obtaining the maximum energy and yield of the radiations. A trend can be seen in terms of energy spectra of the gamma-rays and positrons while increasing the thickness of the targets. The amount of radiation yields is also crucial to the choice of appropriate thickness of the target. In addition, this paper provides a brief description of the electrodynamics processes such as bremsstrahlung and electron\u2013positron pair production initiated by LWFA electron beams.",

        "abstract": "CalliSpheres(\u00ae) Beads (CB) is the first drug-eluting bead (DEB) product in China. Our aim was to compare the effect on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin (DOX) and its local concentration between lipiodol emulsions and CB in the process of TACE in rabbit livers. Twenty-five rabbits were distributed into two groups; Group 1 received lipiodol emulsions with DOX, and Group 2 received CB loaded with DOX (CBDOX). DOX was measured in the peripheral blood at different times after treatment. Livers were sampled at 1 week and 1 month for Group 2 after embolization. DOX concentration and distribution were measured in the liver. The administration of DOX by TACE with CBDOX resulted in peripheral blood DOX concentrations of 39.85\u2009\u00b1\u200913.86\u2009ng/mL at 5\u2009min, with a gradual decrease to 6.89\u2009\u00b1\u20091.62\u2009ng/mL at 24\u2009h, after treatment. Plasma concentration of DOX after chemoembolization with lipiodol was 225.91\u2009\u00b1\u200964.88\u2009ng/mL at 5\u2009min and decreased with time by 24\u2009h to 5.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.48\u2009ng/mL. In CBDOX group, the drug impregnated an area as far as 200\u2009\u03bcm from the bead edge. The tissue concentration of doxorubicin (tissCDOX) ranged from 40.27\u2009\u03bcg/mL to 245.70\u2009\u03bcg/mL at 1 week and from 5.64\u2009\u03bcg/mL to 28.09\u2009\u03bcg/mL at 1 month. Plasma concentrations of DOX resulting from CBDOX embolization were significantly lower than that for cTACE. CB could deliver relatively high concentrations of DOX to an area as far as 200\u2009\u03bcm from the bead edge for at least 1 month.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial embolization (TAE) for iatrogenic renal arterial pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula at our center.Our retrospective analysis included 27 patients who received TAE for iatrogenic renal arterial pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula between January 2006 and January 2016. Data on demographics, type of minimally invasive renal procedures, clinical manifestation, imaging features, embolization procedure, and perioperative details were collected. The technical and clinical success rates were analyzed. Furthermore, the changes in serum creatinine and eGFR before and after embolization were recorded and compared by t test.The median time between iatrogenic renal injury and TAE was 3 days (range, 0-110 days), with most patients (24/27, 88.9%) receiving TAE within 14 days. Only 1 patient was diagnosed with renal artery pseudoaneurysm 110 days after laproscopic partial nephrectomy. The technical and clinical success rates were 100% and 96.3%, respectively, with 1 patient requiring a second embolotherapy at the third postoperative day. No other patient required additional endovascular or surgical intervention due to recurrent hemorrhage. The mean serum creatinine before TAE was 92.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a25.3\u200a\u03bcmol/L and after TAE, 96.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a27.7\u200a\u03bcmol/L (P\u200a=\u200a.095). The eGFR of pre- and postembolization was 75.2\u200a\u00b1\u200a26.5\u200amL/min/1.73\u200am and 72.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a26.2\u200amL/min/1.73\u200am (P\u200a=\u200a.16). No severe complications were observed during follow-up.This retrospective review demonstrated that TAE for the treatment of iatrogenic renal artery pseudoaneurysm and/or arteriovenous fistula was safe and associated with high technical and clinical success rate.",

        "abstract": "Objective This study was performed to determine whether transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus multi-imaging-guided radiofrequency ablation (MIG-RFA) can completely eliminate 3.1- to 5.0-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodules and identify factors that may influence the complete elimination rate (CER) of this therapy. Methods Patients who underwent TACE+MIG-RFA for initial treatment of HCC from January 2008 to January 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 162 patients with 216 HCC nodules (3.1-5.0 cm) were enrolled. TACE was performed first; MIG-RFA was performed 2 to 4 weeks later. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after TACE+MIG-RFA. If tumor enhancement was not detected by the end of the 12-month follow-up, the lesion was considered completely eliminated. Additional TACE+MIG-RFA was performed for residual lesions. The CER was calculated 12 months after the last therapy. Factors that may influence the CER were analyzed. Results In total, 207 (95.8%) nodules showed no residual lesions and were completely eliminated after one or more TACE+MIG-RFA sessions. Nine (4.2%) nodules were incompletely eliminated even with repeated TACE+MIG-RFA. Tumor location was the only significant prognostic factor influencing the CER. Conclusions TACE+MIG-RFA can eliminate 3.1- to 5.0-cm HCC nodules; the tumor location may affect the treatment outcome.",

        "title": "BDNF Contributes to Spinal Long-Term Potentiation and Mechanical Hypersensitivity Via Fyn-Mediated Phosphorylation of NMDA Receptor GluN2B Subunit at Tyrosine 1472 in Rats Following Spinal Nerve Ligation.",
        "abstract": "Previously we have demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) contributes to spinal long-term potentiation (LTP) and pain hypersensitivity through activation of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (GluN2B-NMDA) receptors in rats following spinal nerve ligation (SNL). However, the molecular mechanisms by which BDNF impacts upon GluN2B-NMDA receptors and spinal LTP still remain unclear. In this study, we first documented that Fyn kinase-mediated phosphorylation of GluN2B subunit at tyrosine 1472 (pGluN2B) was involved in BDNF-induced spinal LTP and pain hypersensitivity in intact rats. Second, we revealed a co-localization of Fyn and GluN2B-NMDA receptor in cultured dorsal horn neurons, implying that Fyn is a possible intermediate kinase linking BDNF/TrkB signaling with GluN2B-NMDA receptors in the spinal dorsal horn. Furthermore, we discovered that both SNL surgery and intrathecal active Fyn could induce an increased expression of dorsal horn pGluN2B, as well as pain hypersensitivity in response to von Frey filaments stimuli; and more importantly, all these actions were effectively abrogated by pre-treatment with either PP2 or ifenprodil to respectively inhibit Fyn kinase and GluN2B-NMDA receptors activity. Moreover, we found that intrathecal administration of BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc prior to SNL surgery, could prevent the nerve injury-induced increase of both pFyn and pGluN2B expression, and also inhibit the mechanical allodynia in neuropathic rats. Collectively, these results suggest that Fyn kinase-mediated pGluN2B is critical for BDNF-induced spinal LTP and pain hypersensitivity in SNL rats. Therefore, the BDNF-Fyn-GluN2B signaling cascade in the spinal dorsal horn may constitute a key mechanism underlying central sensitization and neuropathic pain development after peripheral nerve injury.",

        "abstract": "Cancer-associated pain is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced abundance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons sensitized nociceptive sensory neurons and cancer-associated pain. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG neurons suppressed tumor-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in bone metastasis model rats, whereas knocking down TRESK increased neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in normal rats. Mechanistically, tumor-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the abundance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Intrathecal application of exogenous calcineurin to tumor-bearing rats rescued TRESK abundance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal rats reduced TRESK abundance and increased DRG excitability and pain sensitivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone metastasis-associated pain in cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) plays a key role in processing stressful events and affective disorders. Previously we have documented that exposure of chronic forced swim (FS) to rats produces a depressive-like behavior and that sensitization of BLA neurons is involved in this process. In the present study, we demonstrated that chronic FS stress (CFSS) could activate corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)/CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1) signaling in the BLA, and blockade of CRF/CRFR1 signaling by intra-BLA injection of NBI27914 (NBI), a selective CRFR1 antagonist, could prevent the CFSS-induced depressive-like behaviors in rats, indicating that activation of CRF/CRFR1 signaling in the BLA is required for CFSS-induced depression. Furthermore, we discovered that exposure of chronic FS to rats could reinforce long-term potentiation (LTP) at the external capsule (EC)-BLA synapse and increase BLA neuronal excitability, and that all these alterations were inhibited by CRFR1 antagonist NBI. Moreover, we found that application of exogenous CRF also may facilitate LTP at the EC-BLA synapse and sensitize BLA neuronal excitability in normal rats via the activation of CRFR1. We conclude that activation of CRF/CRFR1 signaling in the BLA contributes to chronic FS-induced depressive-like behaviors in rats through potentiating synaptic efficiency at the EC-BLA pathway and sensitizing BLA neuronal excitability.",

In order to find available design trade-offs concerning the antenna footprint, its wideband matching, and efficiency, numerical optimization has been employed. Appropriate formulation of the objective function permits identification of the designs that exhibit the minimum possible footprint while maintaining the maximum in-band reflection and average efficiency within the prescribed thresholds. For the sake of demonstration, a specific case study of a UWB monopole is considered. A set of designs generated using the proposed approach provides a designer with a comprehensive knowledge about the capabilities of a given antenna topology and facilitates a decision making process driven by a particular application and performance requirements.",

        "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization yields indispensable information about the best possible design trade-offs of an antenna structure, yet it is challenging if full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis is utilized for performance evaluation. The latter is a necessity for majority of contemporary antennas as it is the only way of achieving acceptable modeling accuracy. In this paper, a procedure for accelerated multi-objective design of antennas is proposed that exploits fast data-driven surrogates constructed at the level of coarse-discretization EM simulations, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to yield an initial approximation of the Pareto set, and response correction methods for design refinement (i.e., elevating the selected Pareto-optimal designs to the high-fidelity EM simulation model level). To reduce the computational cost of setting up the surrogate, the relevant part of the design space (i.e., the part containing the Pareto front) is first identified through a series of single-objective optimization runs and subsequently represented by a set of adjacent compartments with separate surrogate models established within them. This segmentation process dramatically reduces the number of training samples necessary to build an accurate model thus limiting the overall optimization cost. Our approach is demonstrated using a UWB monopole antenna and compared to a state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted technique that does not use domain segmentation.",

A single terminal sub-coupling matrix is built to extract newly added coupling elements and resonance frequencies by evaluating input impedance from the group delay feature points. Space mapping technique is exploited to efficiently approximate the best solution of geometric parameters in the electromagnetic model. Interpolation technique is also exploited during the optimization process to approximate the mapping using information from earlier optimization.

The features of the anisotropic PESs for these complexes are remarkably similar, which are characterized by three minima and two saddle points between them. The global minimum corresponds to a collinear Rg-Br-Cl configuration. Two local minima, correlate with an anti-linear Rg-Cl-Br geometry and a nearly T-shaped structure, can also be located on each PES. The quantum bound state calculations enable us to investigate intermolecular vibrational states and rotational energy levels of the complexes. The transition frequencies are predicted and are fitted to obtain their corresponding spectroscopic constants. In general, the periodic trends are observed for this complex family. Comparisons with available experimental data for the collinear isomer of Ar-BrCl demonstrate reliability of our theoretical predictions, and our results for the other two isomers of Ar-BrCl as well as for other members of the complex family are also anticipated to be trustable. Except for the collinear isomer of Ar-BrCl, the data presented in this paper would be beneficial to improve our knowledge for these experimentally unknown species.",

The equilibrium geometries of global minima for the complex family are characterized by the collinear Rg-I-Br configurations. The local minima of anti-linear Rg-Br-I and nearly T-shaped structures are also located on the potential energy surfaces. The intermolecular vibrational states, average structural parameters and spectroscopic constants for these complexes are determined for each conformer. Interpretations of the characters of the potential energy surfaces reveal the different extent of the anisotropic feature. The probability\u00a0density\u00a0distribution of intermolecular vibrational states indicates the quantum tunneling effect is much easier to occur for He- and Ne-IBr owing to their lower barrier height. As for Ar-, Kr- and Xe-IBr complexes, the localization effect enables us to investigate more intermolecular vibrational excited states. The predicted spectroscopic constants of all conformers for each complex are anticipated to fill our knowledge gaps of this complex family.",

The as-prepared products were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The results revealed that the molar ratio of Bi3+ to VO43- played an important role in the formation of crystal and morphology. These BiVO4/Bi2VO5.5 heterogeneous nanostructures exhibited higher visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficiency compared to the pure BiVO4 and Bi2VO5.5. For the methyl orange (MO) degradation efficiency of BiVO4/Bi2VO5.5 heterogeneous nanostructures under visible light irradiation, about 95% of MO was degraded within 40min, which is much higher than pure BiVO4 and Bi2VO5.5. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity can attribute to the promoted light absorption capability and the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.",

Morphology and structure transformation of regular 2D nanoflake, 0D nanosphere or 3D nanoflower was achieved by adjusting the ratio of reagent concentration or reaction temperature, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic degradation ability and the photocurrent intensity of BiOCl nanomaterials may be attributed to the improved degree of crystallinity and the formation of Bi/BiOCl heterostructure. The photocurrent density of Schottky battery was increased due to enhancing the optical pathway and assisting during charge separation.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Numerous efforts have been attempted to improve the photocatalytic performance of AgX (X\u202f=\u202fCl, Br, I), because its drawback of the reduction of Ag +  into Ag 0  under illumination would always largely decrease its stability and lifetime. However, the photocatalytic performance of AgX (X\u202f=\u202fCl, Br, I) itself has been long ignored. Herein, novel convex polyhedral-like AgCl and AgBr as well as flake-like AgI were successfully prepared by a simple high-temperature solution method at the atmospheric pressure. The as-prepared samples have been verified to possess extremely excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of various organic pollutants, including rhodamine B (RhB), methyl orange (MO) as well as doxycycline (DOX) and the deactivation of  Staphylococcus aureus  ( S.\u00a0aureus ). Besides, the stability of AgX (X\u202f=\u202fCl, Br, I) has also been investigated in details.",

The samples calcined at 600\u202f\u00b0C exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation, which showed a degradation efficiency of more than 99% within 40\u202fmin. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to its porous hierarchical structure which could promote light absorption efficiency, largely decrease the distance of charge carriers moving to solution and enlarge its specific surface area.

The structures and morphologies of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by XRD, SEM and TEM. The results revealed that \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /CaFe 2 O 4  p-n heterojunctions exhibited superior photocatalytic activity of VOCs degradation compared to pure CaFe 2 O 4  and \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  in both steady model and flow bed model. It can degrade more than 82% of acetaldehyde within 180\u202fmin in steady mode and 65% in flow mode under visible light irradiation. The prominent VOCs remove property could be attributed to the strong interfacial contact caused by the in-situ fabrication process and the promoted charge carrier separation efficiency due to the constructing of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /CaFe 2 O 4  p-n heterojunction. It provides some new insights into the design and fabrication of advanced photocatalytic materials with p-n heterojunction for high efficiency in VOCs photodegradation.",

        "abstract": "Defective Fe3+ self-doped spinel ZnFe2O4 with abundant oxygen vacancies, (Zn1-xFex)Fe2O4-y, was successfully synthesized via a simple spin-coating method and subsequent hydrogen reduction treatment. It displays a photocurrent density of 0.22 mA cm-2 at 1.23 (V vs. RHE), which is 11 times higher than that of pure ZnFe2O4. The largely enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance can be mainly ascribed to the synergism of the numerous oxygen vacancies and self-doped Fe3+, which has never been discussed carefully. Self-doped Fe3+ can be beneficial for increasing the charge carrier densities, while oxygen vacancies can improve the charge mobility and prompt the charge transfer process at the electrolyte interface, leading to improved electric conductivities and faster water oxidation kinetics. Furthermore, the effects of the concentrations of Fe3+ self-doping as well as oxygen vacancies on the PEC activities of ZnFe2O4 were also investigated. This work develops a novel and effective strategy to solve the critical problems existing in ZnFe2O4 for PEC applications and sheds light on the rational design of photoanode materials for efficient PEC water splitting.",

The morphology of the BiOI nanoarchitecture strongly depends on the experimental conditions such as the presence of diethylene glycol and hydrothermal time. The photocatalytic property of the BiOI nanostructures by monitoring the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) mixed dyes was studied under visible light illumination, which has not been reported previously. The degradation of single cationic RhB dye is faster when compared with that of anionic MO dye. This result is due to the surface negative charges on the BiOI nanoflowers that display good selectivity towards positive RhB dye organic groups owing to electrostatic attraction.",

        "abstract": "The phthalate ester compounds in industrial wastewater, as kinds of environmental toxic organic pollutants, may interfere with the body's endocrine system, resulting in great harm to humans. In this work, the photocatalytic degradation properties of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) were investigated using \u03b1-FeO nanoparticles and HO in aqueous solution system. The optimal parameters and mechanism of degradation were discussed by changing the morphology and usage amount of catalysts, the dosage of HO, pH value and the initial concentration of DBP. Hollow \u03b1-FeO nanoparticles showed the highest degradation efficiency when 30\u2009mg of catalyst and 50\u2009\u00b5l of HO were used in the DBP solution with the initial concentration of 13\u2009mg\u2009l at pH\u2009=\u20096.5. When the reaction time was 90\u2009min, DBP was degraded 93% for the above optimal parameters. The photocatalytic degradation mechanism of DBP was studied by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique. The result showed that the main degradation intermediates of DBP were -phthalate monobutyl ester, methyl benzoic acid, benzoic acid, benzaldehyde, and heptyl aldehyde when the reaction time was 2\u2009h. DBP and its intermediates were almost completely degraded to CO and HO in 12\u2009h in the \u03b1-FeO/ HO/UV system.",

These meta-stable nanodomain phases, which precipitated in Mg-6Zn alloy during isothermal ageing at 200 \u00baC, contain two separate unit cells in the two-dimensional plane perpendicular to five-fold axis but periodic atom arrangement along the five-fold axis, i.e., 72\u00b0 rhombus structure and 72\u00b0 equilateral hexagon structure. The self-assembly of two unit cells under some geomotrical constraints into a nanodomain contains the 2D five-fold, C14 and C15 structures. This finding confirms the existence of solid matters in a special structure between the crystals and quasicrystals, and it is expected to provide a way for understanding the atomic arrangement and stacking behavior in condensed matters.",

        "abstract": "In the present work, a series of Ta/Ru/Co-23 at%Pt thin films with varied Ru underlayer thicknesses were fabricated by magnetron sputtering. All of the films show c-axis preferred orientation perpendicular to the film surface. The drop of c/a ratio and lattice expansion of Co\u2013Pt layer with the increase in Ru underlayer thickness was revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The coercivity of the Ta/Ru/Co\u2013Pt thin films increases drastically with Ru underlayer thickness increasing, due to the enhancement of effective magneto-crystalline anisotropy constant and exchange decoupling of magnetic nano-grains. The enhancement of effective magneto-crystalline anisotropy constant is ascribed to the lattice deformation of Co\u2013Pt layer by mismatching the Ru layer and Co\u2013Pt surface. Moreover, the exchange decoupling of magnetic nano-grains is attributed to the further isolation of magnetic nano-grains.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Natural diatomite (DT) is the ancient deposit of diatom skeleton with many regular pores of 50\u2013200\u00a0nm and also an abundant source of biogenic silica. Although silica is considered biologically safe and there is an increasing interest of using natural diatomite for biomedical applications, the toxicity information about natural diatomite is still missing. Here, cytotoxicity of natural diatomite on osteoblasts and fibroblasts were compared to hydroxyapatite and the relationships between cytotoxicity and diatomite sizes, dose, geometry or impurity were systematically investigated. Cell adhesion and interaction with diatomite particles were also fluorescently observed. The results clearly suggested a size-, dose- and shape-dependent cytotoxicity of natural diatomite. Disk-shaped diatomite particles with average size of 30\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter revealed the least toxicity, while the diatomite particles with irregular shapes and sizes less than 10\u00a0\u03bcm were remarkably toxic. Diatomite particles with proper sizes were then selected to investigate the reinforcing effect on injectable calcium phosphate bone cement. Results showed that diatomite significantly improved the compressive strength of bone cement but did not alter the injectability of the cement. This work provided important biocompatibility information of natural diatomite and demonstrated the feasibility of using selected diatomite as bone implant material.",

The seamless surface nanostructure offered a large surface area and improved conductivity. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the seamless nanowires structure could electrochemically reduce nitrate due to the improved conductivity between the active sites and the substrate. A linear response to nitrate ions over a concentration range from 50\u202f\u03bcM to 600\u202f\u03bcM (R 2 \u202f=\u202f0.9974) with a high sensitivity of 0.357\u202f\u03bcA\u202f\u03bcM \u22121 \u202fcm \u22121  and low detection limit of 12.2\u202f\u03bcM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, respectively, were obtained on the nanostructured copper wire.

Here we shed light on the improvement of carrier conductivity by combing orientation control and transition metal doping. To rule out the influence of surface facets of hematite when adjusting the film orientation, the hematite photoanode films were fabricated by assembling the spherical particles with single crystalline nature. The doped hematite particles were aligned with (001) plane normal to the substrate by a magnetic field (MF) during the drop-casting process. A considerable improvement in photocurrent density was resulted from the orientation control, which is due to the increased carrier density from Sn doping and efficient charge transportation in the (001) plane observed through electrochemical impedance spectra.",

The quasi-single phase Mg-Zn(-Ag) alloys showed lower degradation rate and more homogeneous degradation than corresponding as-extruded Mg alloys. Degradation rate of solid-solution treated Mg-3Zn-1Ag and Mg-3Zn-3Ag was approximately half that of corresponding as-extruded Mg alloy. Moreover, the degradation rate of solid-solution treated Mg-3Zn and Mg-3Zn-1Ag was equivalent to that of as-extruded pure Mg. However, heterogeneous degradation also occurred in quasi-single phase Mg-Zn-Ag alloys, compared to pure Mg. So, preparing complete single-phase Mg alloys could be a potential and feasible way to improve the corrosion resistance.",

Although the concept of the photocathodic protection of steels has been proposed for about two decades, this technique is still far away from practical applications due to the limited protection capability. In this work, we reported that the BiVO 4  photoanode significantly decreases the self-corrosion potential of 316 steel by 166\u2009mV, and the decoration of NiFeO  x   films onto BiVO 4  further shifts the self-corrosion potential by \u223c90\u2009mV negatively, which exhibits an excellent protection capability.

However, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of \u03b1-Fe2O3 is limited by fast recombination of carriers. In this work, we demonstrate that the recombination of \u03b1-Fe2O3 films could be suppressed by forming the heterojunction structure with cubic-In2O3. By utilizing the magnetron sputtering method, the In2O3/\u03b1-Fe2O3 films were prepared when the In concentration exceeded its solubility in \u03b1-Fe2O3 matrix, which was confirmed by the XRD and TEM analysis. The dependence of charge separation on heterojunction structure was evidenced by Mott\u2013Schottky and EIS analyses. It was found that the enhanced separation of holes and electrons in \u03b1-Fe2O3 films contributed to higher PEC performance.",

The structural and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of the films were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, Energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water splitting experiment. The film fabricated at 500\u00a0\u00b0C shows the strongest diffraction peak of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . EDS shows the films are composed of Fe, O and Pt, which were confirmed by the XPS measurement. The water splitting experiment indicates the doping of Pt is effective to enhance the PEC response. The film fabricated at 500\u00a0\u00b0C shows a maximum photocurrent density of 0.34\u00a0mA/cm 2  at 1.23\u00a0V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under standard illumination conditions (AM 1.5\u00a0G 100\u00a0mW/cm 2 ).

In this study, the photocatalytic degradation of acetochlor using \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  nanoparticles under H 2 O 2 /UV system was studied with UV-Vis spectrophotometer and GC MS. The degradation rate was investigated on the effects of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  morphology and dosage, initial acetochlor concentration, solution pH, and H 2 O 2  dosage. The results showed that photocatalytic degradation efficiency could reach 91% by \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  with 200\u2009mg/L hollow morphology at an initial acetochlor concentration, pH value, and H 2 O 2  dosage of 50\u2009mg/L, 7 and 40\u2009\u03bcL, respectively. The photocatalytic reaction mechanism and degradation process of acetochlor by \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  were investigated and the degradation pathway of acetochlor was proposed. The oxidative attack involves N C bond connecting the aromatic ring with side chain, the nitrogen-containing side chain, chlorinated aliphatic to produce 1-methyl-3-ving-benzene, allyl-methyl-amine and 1-chloro-2-ethoxy-ethane. These intermediate products could be further oxidized to NO 3  \u2212 , CO 2  and H 2 O. These findings provide new insights for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in the using \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  nanoparticles to achieve pollutant degradation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Constructing materials with high-density interfaces offers a very promising route to enable high-performance nanocatalysts. Herein, a one-pot method to synthetize CuO x \u2013CeO 2  spherical catalysts with high-density interfaces is developed by controlling the growth condition so that the CuO x  can only nucleate and grow via heterogeneous mode. The synthesis method ensures fine dispersion of CuO x  over CeO 2  and the density of interface between CuO x  and CeO 2 . The generation of the species of Cu + , Ce 3+ , and oxygen vacancies are enhanced by the interface interaction. And the reduction of copper ions to metals is effectively suppressed, which helps to avoid deactivation of catalyst at high temperature. When catalyzing the CO preferential oxidation reaction (CO-PROX), the CuO x \u2013CeO 2  composite with high-density interfaces exhibits a strikingly high catalytic oxidation activity at a broad operating temperature window (i.e. CO 100% conversion, 95\u2013235\u00a0\u00b0C). The heterogeneous nucleation methodology of synthesizing composite with high-density interfaces reported in this work also applies to other materials system.",

However, their thermal and catalytic stability against sintering and aggregation during preparation and reactions remains a serious issue in practical applications, and what is even more difficult is to solve this mutually exclusive problem by a feasible technique. Here, we propose a simple one-step ultra-low temperature interfacial plasma electrolytic oxidation (ULTPEO) process to successfully prepare sub-10 nm and highly stable Au NPs, supported on a porous MgO layer, with high activity and a long lifespan. The obtained Au NPs, with partially exposed free surfaces, are encapsulated into a porous MgO support film. This unique embedded structure restrains their sintering on the support surface during high temperature treatment even up to 600 \u00b0C and shows good thermal stability and excellent recyclability in a model reaction of the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol. Moreover, the developed technique allows the facile control of the average size of Au NPs down to \u223c3 nm with high monodispersity by liquid nitrogen cooling, and hence a further significant improvement in catalytic activity and the lowest catalytic activation energy of \u223c14 kJ mol\u22121 among the reported literature are obtained. This simple technique is also extended to other metal NP catalysts (e.g. Ru and Pd) that support MgO and exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride and oxidation of silanes, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) holds potential as a direct route for solar energy storage. Its performance is governed by how efficiently photoexcited charges are separated and how fast the charges are transferred to the solution, both of which are highly sensitive to the photoelectrode surfaces near the electrolyte. While other aspects of a PEC system, such as the light-absorbing materials and the catalysts that facilitate charge transfer, have been extensively examined in the past, an underwhelming amount of attention has been paid to the energetics at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. The lack of understanding of this interface is an important reason why many photoelectrode materials fail to deliver the expected performance in harvesting solar energy in a PEC system. Using hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3) as a material platform, we present in this Perspective how surface modifications can alter the energetics and the resulting consequences on the overall PEC performance. It has been shown that a detailed understanding of the photoelectrode/eletrolyte interfaces can contribute significantly to improving the performance of hematite, which enabled unassisted solar water splitting when combined with an amorphous Si photocathode.

        "abstract": "In this theoretical study, first-principles calculations were carried out to explore the photocatalytic activity of cation (Ti or Zr) and anion (N) compensated codoped hematite based on density functional theory (DFT). For (Ti/Zr,N) codoped hematite, the band edges of the conduction band and the valence band move close to each other, leading to an obvious bandgap reduction. Compared with the pure hematite, the optical absorption coefficient of codoped hematite is significantly enhanced in the visible light region. The charge distribution at the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) is spatially separated after codoping, which is beneficial for extending the carrier lifetime. More interestingly, the CBM becomes electronically delocalized in (Ti,N) doped hematite, which indicates better carrier transport properties in the bulk system. Due to these special features of (Ti/Zr,N) codoped hematite, an improved photocatalytic performance can be expected. ",

        "abstract": "Hydroponics experiment was conducted to identify cadmium (Cd) tolerance and phytoextraction potential of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) seedlings grown under different levels of Cd. Application of Cd adversely affected the overall growth and ultrastructural characteristics of moso bamboo. At the highest Cd concentration (400\u00a0\u00b5M), the growth of moso bamboo seedlings was significantly inhibited, and Cd concentrations in leaves, stems and roots reached the maximum of 25.6, 129.8 and 377\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the excessive Cd concentrations caused formation of abundant inclusions in the root and stem. The ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the excessive Cd concentrations caused abnormal-shaped chloroplasts, disappearance of endoplasmic reticulum, and shrinkage of nucleus and loss of thylakoid membranes. It is suggested that use of moso bamboo as experimental material provides a new perspective for remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil due to its deep root system and larger biomass. However, mechanisms of Cd uptake and accumulation as well as metal interactions within the plant cell need to be investigated further.",

        "abstract": "The effects of zinc (Zn) on seed germination and growth of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) were investigated. Under zinc stress, the seed germination rate did not show significant difference from that of the control. Hydroponics experiments indicated that Moso bamboo had a strong ability to accumulate Zn in the shoot and it reached its maximum value in the shoot at 100 \u03bcM Zn. The root Zn concentration ranged from 2,329.29 to 8,642.51 mg kg(-1), with the root Zn concentration at 10 \u03bcM Zn being 58.23 times that of the control. The root morphology parameters slightly increased at the lower Zn treatments, while growth restriction was evident at higher Zn treatments. Root ultrastructural studies revealed that the cell structure, root tips, and organelles were significantly changed under Zn stress as compared to those of the control. Some abnormalities were evident in the cell walls, vacuoles, mitochondria, plasmalemma, tonoplast, and xylem parenchyma of root cells. While Moso bamboo seems a suitable candidate for phytoremediation, its metal remediation ability should be further explored in future investigations.",

The optical absorption, photoluminescence and TEM measurement results indicated that the evolution of Ag species (including Ag + , molecular-like Ag clusters and Ag nanoparticles) is very sensitive to the original host composition. It is suggested that in the EuF 3 -AgNO 3  co-doped system, the reduction of Ag +  ions into Ag atoms and the following aggregation process are not only closely related with the presence of the variable valence ions (Eu 3+/2+ ) as reported previously, but also greatly affected by fluoride content and monovalence cation that constitute the host composition. The evolution of Ag species and the size distribution of the molecular-like Ag clusters can thus be controlled to benefit the efficient energy transfer from ML-Ag clusters to Eu 3+ .The obtained results also offered a convenient method to control the CIE coordinates in the EuF 3 -AgNO 3  co-doped oxyfluoride glasses by slightly adjusting the glass composition.",

The structure and luminescence properties were studied by absorption spectra, transmission electron microscopy, as well as steady and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra. The experimental results indicated that the doping of SmF 3  can accelerate the formation and growth of Ag nanoclusters due to the introduction of valence-variable Sm 2\u00a0+/3\u00a0+  ions and more F-center clusters in glass host. Besides, benefitting from the size-dependent tunable luminescence properties, the Ag nanoclusters were proved to be an efficient broadband sensitizer for Sm 3\u00a0+  ions. Heat treatment may but not necessarily improve the photoluminescence intensity of Ag nanoclusters and Sm 3\u00a0+  ions, depending on the amount of Ag nanoclusters and non-luminescent Ag nanoparticles formatted in the glass host.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Yb 3+  and Er 3+  ions co-doped NaYF 4  nanocrystals were synthesized with different amounts of NaOH via oleic acid (OA)-assisted hydrothermal process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and photoluminescence spectra were used to characterize the products. The result indicated that the introduction of NaOH into the initial reaction solution effectively promoted the cubic (\u03b1-) to hexagonal (\u03b2-) phase transition of NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ ,Er 3+  nanocrystals, while excessive amount of NaOH favored the formation of \u03b1-NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ ,Er 3+  nanocrystals. Besides, with the increase of NaOH amount, the morphologies of \u03b2-NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ ,Er 3+  nanocrystals varied from irregular nanobranch to uniform nanorod. Further investigation revealed that the addition of NaOH could facilitate the deprotonation of OA, leading to the formation of oleate (OA \u2212 ), and meanwhile increased the concentration of OH \u2212  ions, inducing consequently the phase transition and morphology evolution of NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ ,Er 3+  nanocrystals. Moreover, the upconversion luminescence properties of NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ ,Er 3+  nanocrystals were systematically investigated. It was found that the upconversion emissions not only depended on the phase and morphology but also were influenced by the surface groups.",

The reaction time and temperature dependent experimental results implied that the introduciton of extra oleate ligands can both promote the \u03b1-to-\u03b2 phase transition and impeded the crystal growth of NaYF 4 , which is due to the oleate ligand induced orderly arrangement of Y 3+  and capping effect, respectively. It is expected that the oleate ligands mediated phase transition and size evaluation, demonstrated here in NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ , Er 3+  NCs, is also applicable to other lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals.",

        "abstract": "ZnO quantum dots (QDs) with tunable size and photoluminescence can be achieved simply by controlling their growth during the sol\u2013gel synthesis process. However, the role of alkali metal hydroxide MOH (M = Li, Na or K) as the reactant in the growth of ZnO QDs is still controversial. In this work, we carried out a comprehensive study on the growth of ZnO QDs by using different types of MOH as the reactant under different reaction temperatures and in different solvents. The results reveal that the growth of ZnO QDs is considerably governed by MOH through the co-effect of OH\u2212 and M+ ions, which can facilitate and hinder the growth, respectively. Further investigations suggest that the hindering effect caused by M+ cations is strongly dependent on the amount of OH\u2212 anions around the ZnO QD surface and follows the trend of Li+ u003e Na+ u003e K+. Moreover, the dual role of the reactant MOH can also be confirmed when altering reaction temperature and solvent. The photoluminescence of ZnO QDs shows size-dependence and can be easily tuned over a wide range from purple to yellow via adjusting the reaction parameters. This research establishes a fundamental understanding on the growth of ZnO QDs from the role of the reactant MOH point of view, which may benefit the controllable growth of ZnO QDs.",

In this study, we prepared molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) and investigated the adsorption and photocatalytic regeneration performance, followed by the effect of different environmental factors and photoproduct identification. Compared with non-imprinted polymers (NIPs) and P25, MIPs had a better adsorption performance towards norfloxacin with the removal efficiency of 77.1% in 1\u00a0h. pH, humic acid, and high valence ions had significant effects on the adsorption performance. Under neutral condition, the adsorption effect of MIPs was better than that of acidic and alkaline condition. The removal efficiency declined to 25.9% when pH reached 11. The removal efficiency gradually improved with the concentration of humic acid increasing. The adsorption efficiency of MIPs in surface water was only 12.6% lower than that of ultrapure water, which indicated that molecular imprinting process improved the anti-interference property. The photodegradation rate was 0.114\u00a0min when the concentration of norfloxacin was 1\u00a0mg\u00a0L. Norfloxacin was oxidized with aldehyde group or hydroxyl. The adsorption removal efficiency of MIPs did not decline apparently after 11 adsorption-photocatalytic regeneration cycles, which suggested that the in-situ regeneration and sustainable use of MIPs were achievable in organic pollutant control.",

Various computational tools have been developed to identify and analyze DNA methylation dynamics in a variety of critical biological processes. As DNA methylation is becoming increasingly viewed as a dynamic process, the mechanisms governing DNA methylation dynamics and its roles in the transcriptional regulatory network are of great interest. It has been reported that DNA methylation dynamics plays essential roles in multiple biological processes, including development and cancer. As a functional event, the dynamics of DNA methylation have become increasingly relevant to many researchers.

However, their energy storage mechanisms are complicated and not well established. Recent energy storage mechanisms of ZIBs usually depend on the cationic redox. The anionic redox is still not observed due to the limitation of cathodes and electrolytes. Herein, we develop highly reversible aqueous ZIBs based on layered VOPO4 cathodes and water in salt electrolyte. Such batteries display reversible oxygen redox at high voltage region. The oxygen redox not only provides ~27% additional capacity, but also increases the average operating voltage to ~1.56 V. Therefore, the energy density is increased by ~36% in comparison with the case without the oxygen redox. Furthermore, the oxygen redox promotes the reversible crystal structure evolution of VOPO4 during charge/discharge process, thus resulting in enhanced rate capability and cycling performance.",

Therefore, it is necessary to measure personal HRTFs. This paper presents a measurement system for fast estimation of 2D individual HRTFs in both azimuth and elevation with a head tracker. The subject can rotate its head arbitrarily during the measurement and get visual feedback on its current and already visited positions. Variable step-size activation based normalized least mean square (VSA-NLMS) and progressive based NLMS (VSP-NLMS) adaptive filtering algorithms are used for extracting the 2D individual HRTFs. Measured results show that the proposed measurement system works well for arbitrary head movements.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that reverberation plays an important role in perceived externalization of three-dimensional audio over headphones. In the case of the externalization of a frontal sound source, the reverberation heard by both ears is equally important. Relatively little is known about the relative influence of reverberation at the contralateral versus the ipsilateral ear on perceived externalization of a lateral sound source. For a lateral sound source, the direct sound energy is much higher at the ipsilateral ear than at the contralateral ear due to the shadowing effect, which dominates at mid to high frequencies. The reverberant energy does not have a major difference between two ears. Therefore, the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio is much lower for the contralateral ear than for the ipsilateral ear. In addition, the frequency-to-frequency variability, which describes the frequency variability in the magnitude spectrum, is more pronounced in the contralateral ear than in the ipsilateral ear. The results of two listening experiments and the analysis of short-term binaural cues suggested that the reverberation at the contralateral ear has more influence on perceived externalization of a lateral sound source than that at the ipsilateral ear.",

Unfortunately, the estimation accuracy for the frequency dependent reverberation time is lower than for the full-band reverberation time due to the lower signal energy in sub-band filters. This study presents a novel approach for the blind estimation of reverberation time in the full frequency range. The maximum likelihood method is applied for the estimation of the reverberation time from low- to mid-frequencies, and the reverberation time from mid- to high-frequencies is predicted by our proposed model based on the analysis of the reverberation time calculated from room impulse responses in different rooms. The proposed method is validated by two experiments and shows a good performance.",

        "abstract": "RNA binding proteins (RBPs)-mediated post-transcriptional control has been implicated in influencing various aspects of RNA metabolism and playing important roles in mammalian development and pathological diseases. However, the functions of specific RBPs and the molecular mechanisms through which they act in monocyte/macrophage differentiation remain to be determined. In this study, through bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, we identify that ZFP36L1, a member of ZFP36 zinc finger protein family, exhibits significant decrease in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients compared with normal controls and remarkable time-course increase during monocyte/macrophage differentiation of PMA-induced THP-1 and HL-60 cells as well as induction culture of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Lentivirus-mediated gain and loss of function assays demonstrate that ZFP36L1 acts as a positive regulator to participate in monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Mechanistic investigation further reveals that ZFP36L1 binds to the CDK6 mRNA 3'untranslated region bearing adenine-uridine rich elements and negatively regulates the expression of CDK6 which is subsequently demonstrated to impede the in vitro monocyte/macrophage differentiation of CD34(+) HSPCs. Collectively, our work unravels a ZFP36L1-mediated regulatory circuit through repressing CDK6 expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation, which may also provide a therapeutic target for AML therapy.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) is emerging as a critical regulator in organ development and various cancers. However, its role in normal hematopoiesis and leukaemogenesis remains unclear. Here, we detected its increased expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation of HL-60, THP1 cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and confirmed that PU.1, a key transcriptional factor for monocyte/macrophage differentiation, is responsible for transcriptional activation of miR-22 during the differentiation. By gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that miR-22 promoted monocyte/macrophage differentiation, and MECOM (EVI1) mRNA is a direct target of miR-22 and MECOM (EVI1) functions as a negative regulator in the differentiation. The miR-22-mediated MECOM degradation increased c-Jun but decreased GATA2 expression, which results in increased interaction between c-Jun and PU.1 via increasing c-Jun levels and relief of MECOM- and GATA2-mediated interference in the interaction, and thus promoting monocyte/macrophage differentiation. We also observed significantly down-regulation of PU.1 and miR-22 as well as significantly up-regulation of MECOM in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Reintroduction of miR-22 relieved the differentiation blockage and inhibited the growth of bone marrow blasts of AML patients. Our results revealed new function and mechanism of miR-22 in normal hematopoiesis and AML development and demonstrated its potential value in AML diagnosis and therapy.",

        "abstract": "Aberrant activation of c-Myc plays an important oncogenic role via regulating a series of coding and non-coding genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) can remove acetyl group from histone and regulate gene expression via changing chromatin structure. Here, we found miR-451 is abnormally down-regulated in AML patient samples; c-Myc recruits HDAC3 to form a transcriptional suppressor complex, co-localizes on the miR-451 promoter, epigenetically inhibits its transcription and finally induces its downregulation in AML. Furthermore, our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that miR-451 functions as a tumor suppressor via promoting apoptosis and suppressing malignant cell proliferation. The mechanistic study demonstrated that miR-451 directly targets YWHAZ mRNA and suppresses YWHAZ/AKT signaling in AML. Knockdown of c-Myc results in restoration of miR-451 and inhibition of YWHAZ/AKT signaling. In AML patients, low level of miR-451 is negatively correlated with high levels of c-Myc and YWHAZ, while c-Myc level is positively related to YWHAZ expression. These results suggested that c-Myc\u00e2\u008a\u00a3miR-451\u00e2\u008a\u00a3YWHAZ/AKT cascade might play a crucial role during leukemogenesis, and reintroduction of miR-451 could be as a potential strategy for AML therapy.",

        "abstract": "Myelopoiesis is under the control of a complex network containing various regulation factors. Deregulation of any important regulation factors may result in serious consequences including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In order to find out the genes that may take a part in AML development, we analyzed data from AML cDNA microarray (GSE2191) in the NCBI data pool and noticed that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is abnormally over-expressed in AML patients. Then we investigated the function and mechanisms of hnRNP A1 in myeloid development. A gradually decreased hnRNP A1 expression was detected during granulocytic differentiation in ATRA-induced-NB4 and HL-60 cells and cytokines-induced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. By function-loss and winning experiments we demonstrated hnRNP A1's inhibition role via inhibiting expression of C/EBP\u03b1, a key regulator of granulocytic differentiation, in the granulocytic differentiation. During granulocytic differentiation the decrease of hnRNP A1 reduces inhibition on C/EBP\u03b1 expression, and the increased C/EBP\u03b1 promotes the differentiation. We also demonstrated that miR-451 promotes granulocytic differentiation via targeting to and down-regulating hnRNP A1, and hnRNP A1 positively regulates c-Myc expression. Summarily, our results revealed new function and mechanisms of hnRNP A1 in normal granulocytiesis and the involvement of a feed-back loop comprising c-Myc, miR-451 and hnRNP A1 in AML development.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell biology offers promise for understanding the origins of mammary gland. However, the distribution of mammary stem cell (MaSC) activities at earlier embryonic stage has not been fully identified. As the markers for sorting adult MaSC, CD24, CD29 and CD49f have been applied to analyze fetal MaSCs. Here we explored mammary anlagen MaSCs by investigating CD24/CD49f expressions. According to the comparative analysis between adult mammary gland and fetal mammary anlagen, we found that fetal mouse mammary anlagen might possess high percentage of potential MaSCs. Then, the flow cytometric analysis revealed two distinct mammary anlagen populations: Lin-CD24med and Lin-CD24high. The following sphere-forming and mammary repopulating assays confirmed that the stem activity of E14.5 mouse mammary anlagen was restricted to Lin-CD24med cell population. Furthermore, CD24med mammary anlagen cells were separated into Lin-CD24medCD49f+ and Lin-CD24medCD49f- populations and identified, respectively. The results proved that mammary anlagen Lin-CD24medCD49f+ cell population possess more stem cell activities than Lin-CD24medCD49f- cell population did. However, the limited numbers of stem cells and large numbers of stromal cells were identified in mammary anlagen Lin-CD24med cell population.",

        "abstract": "The function of prolactin in mammary gland development and lactation has been demonstrated in previous studies. However, the potential action of prolactin on mammary duct morphogenesis at mammary anlagen stage (E13.5\u02dc15.5) has not been elucidated. Transplantation of mammary cells or tissue is an effective approach for the regeneration of damaged mammary gland. Defining the actions of prolactin stimulation on embryonic mammary anlagen has important implications for defining the role of prolactin in the poorly understood processes of mammary duct morphogenesis and regeneration. Here, we have employed the GFP-transgenic mouse model to examine the effects of prolactin on stem cell activity. Using in vitro prolactin stimulation and transplantation of E14.5 mouse mammary anlagen, we identified the influence of prolactin on their mammary repopulating ability. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence staining and microarray analysis, the influence of prolactin on cell characteristics and gene expression in mammary anlagen were also profiled. We also demonstrate that E14.5 mouse mammary anlagen possess mammary stem cells (MaSCs) which achieve mammary repopulation. Furthermore, we found that in vitro prolactin stimulation elevates MaSC activity and promotes the mammary repopulating ability of mammary anlagen. Finally, microarray and pathway analysis showed that MAPK, Akt and JAK-STAT signaling was activated by prolactin stimulation, and drove the mammary repopulation of mammary anlagen. We conclude that prolactin stimulation elevates the stem cell-dependent mammary repopulating ability of embryonic mammary anlagen.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurological disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons. There are no definitive pathogenic mechanisms and effective treatments for ALS now. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an important role in Chinese health care system. Huolingshengji Formula (HLSJ) is a TCM formula which is applied for treating flaccid syndrome. Our previous clinical study has indicated that HLSJ may have therapeutic effects in ALS patients. In the present study, we analyzed the chemical profile of HLSJ by the high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) fingerprint analysis. And we investigated the therapeutic effects and neuroprotective mechanisms of HLSJ against ALS in SOD1 mouse model. Eleven typical peaks were identified by the fingerprint analysis of HLSJ, and the HPLC method had good precision, repeatability and stability. Consistent with our clinical studies, HLSJ significantly prolonged the lifespan, extended the disease duration, and prevented the motor neuron loss in the anterior horn of the lumbar spinal cords in SOD1 ALS model mice. Additionally, HLSJ alleviated the atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscles and ameliorated the apoptotic and inflammatory levels in the spinal cords of SOD1 mice. Collectively, our study indicated that HLSJ might be a novel candidate for the treatment of ALS.",

However, the mechanisms for Tet-1 regulation remain largely unknown. Here we showed that miR-29 family (miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-29c) can directly repress Tet1 expression. We found that Tet1 was highly expressed and 5hmC was presented at relatively high levels in mouse ESCs, but the levels of both Tet1 and 5hmC were reduced during the early differentiation of ESCs. On the contrary, miR-29 level was increased in this process. ESCs stably transfecting with miR-29 precursors showed lower levels of Tet1 protein and 5hmC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-29 overexpression selectively affected cell lineage markers and skewed ESC differentiation, which was similar in Tet1 knockdown ESCs. Our results indicate that miR-29 is a direct regulator of Tet1 in mouse ESCs.",

However, the molecular mechanisms for the neuronal loss is still debated. Here, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from somatic cells of familial AD patients carrying PSEN1 mutations to study the early pathogenic event of AD. We found that premature neuronal differentiation with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis occured in AD-iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (AD-NPCs) once neuronal differentiation was initiated, together with higher levels of A\u03b242 and phosphorylated tau. Premature neuronal differentiation in AD-NPCs was caused by PSEN1 mutations and might be correlated to multiple dysregulated processes including but not limited to Wnt-Notch pathway. Our study documented previously unappreciated early NPC dysfunction in AD-NPCs, providing valuable new insights into the early mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis.",

Environmental factors are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of AD. In the present study, we investigated the impacts of acute hypoxia on A\u03b2 and tau pathologies, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial function, and autophagy in APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Male APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice and their age-matched wild type (Wt) littermates were exposed to one single acute hypoxic episode (oxygen 7%) for 24 h. We found that acute hypoxia exposure increased the expressions of amyloid precursor protein (APP), anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and promoted tau phosphorylation at T181 and T231 residues in both Tg and Wt mice. In addition, acute hypoxia also induced autophagy through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, elicited abnormal mitochondrial function and neuroinflammation in both Tg and Wt mice. In summary, all these findings suggest that acute hypoxia could induce the AD-like pathological damages in the brain of APP/PS1 mice and Wt mice to some extent.",

        "abstract": "Over the decades, pharmaceutical treatments, particularly dopaminergic (DAergic) drugs have been considered as the main therapy against motor symptoms of Parkinsonu0027s disease (PD). It is proposed that DAergic drugs in combination with other medications, such as monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors, catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors, anticholinergics and other newly developed non-DAergic drugs can make a better control of motor symptoms or alleviate levodopa-induced motor complications. Moreover, non-motor symptoms of PD, such as cognitive, neuropsychiatric, sleep, autonomic and sensory disturbances caused by intrinsic PD pathology or drug-induced side effects, are gaining increasing attention and urgently need to be taken care of due to their impact on quality of life. Currently, neuroprotective therapies have been investigated extensively in pre-clinical studies, and some of them have been subjected to clinical trials. Furthermore, non-pharmaceutical treatments, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), gene therapy, cell replacement therapy and some complementary managements, such as Tai chi, Yoga, traditional herbs and molecular targeted therapies have also been considered as effective alternative therapies to classical pharmaceutics. This review will provide us updated information regarding the current drugs and non-drugs therapies for PD.",

        "abstract": "Sleep disorders are among the most common clinical problems and possess a significant concern for the geriatric population. More importantly, while around 40% of elderly adults have sleep-related complaints, sleep disorders are more frequently associated with co-morbidities including age-related neurodegenerative diseases and mild cognitive impairment. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that disturbed sleep may not only serve as the consequence of brain atrophy, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia and, therefore, significantly increase dementia risk. Since the current therapeutic interventions lack efficacies to prevent, delay or reverse the pathological progress of dementia, a better understanding of underlying mechanisms by which sleep disorders interact with the pathogenesis of dementia will provide possible targets for the prevention and treatment of dementia. In this review, we briefly describe the physiological roles of sleep in learning/memory, and specifically update the recent research evidence demonstrating the association between sleep disorders and dementia. Plausible mechanisms are further discussed. Moreover, we also evaluate the possibility of sleep therapy as a potential intervention for dementia.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small and evolutionary conserved non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Differential expression levels of miRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers of disease. Previous animal studies have indicated that the expression level of miR-132 is negatively correlated with its downstream molecule nuclear receptor related 1 protein (Nurr1), which is one of the key factors for the maintenance of dopaminergic function and is particularly vulnerable in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, this correlation has not been confirmed in human patients with PD. Moreover, the possible involvement of miR-132 during the pathogenesis and progression of PD is not fully investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we determined the peripheral circulation levels of miR-132 and Nurr1 in patients with PD, neurological disease controls (NDC) and healthy controls (HC) by reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Our data clearly demonstrated that the plasma miR-132 level in PD was significantly higher than those in HC (178%, p < 0.05) and NDC (188%, p < 0.001). When adjusted for gender and age, higher level of miR-132 expression was associated with the significantly increased risk for PD in male, and was closely related with the disease stages and disease severity. Furthermore, peripheral Nurr1 was significantly decreased in PD compared with HC (56%, p < 0.001) and NDC (58%, p < 0.001). Much more interestingly, further analysis revealed a negatively correlation between the decreased Nurr1 level and the elevated miR-132 level in PD. All these findings indicated that the combination of high miR-132 level with its downstream low Nurr1 level might be a potential biomarker aiding in the diagnosis of PD and monitoring the disease progression.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, which still lacks a biomarker to aid in diagnosis and to differentiate diagnosis at the early stage of the disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small and evolutionary conserved non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Several miRNAs have been proposed as potential biomarkers in several diseases. In the present study, we screened miRNAs using a network vulnerability analysis, to evaluate their potential as PD biomarkers. We first extracted miRNAs that were differentially expressed between PD and healthy controls (HC) samples. Then we constructed the PD-specific miRNA-mRNA network and screened miRNA biomarkers using a new bioinformatics model. With this model, we identified miR-105-5p as a putative biomarker for PD. Moreover, we measured miR-105-5p levels in the plasma of patients with idiopathic PD (IPD) ( = 319), neurological disease controls (NDC,  = 305) and HC ( = 273) using reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Our data clearly demonstrated that the plasma miR-105-5p level in IPD patients was significantly higher than those of HC (251%,  < 0.001) and NDC (347%,  < 0.001). There was no significant difference in miR-105-5p expression between IPD patients with or without anti-PD medications. Interestingly, we found that the plasma miR-105-5p expression level may be able to differentiate IPD from parkinsonian syndrome, essential tremor and other neurodegenerative diseases. We believe that a change in the plasma miR-105-5p level is a potential biomarker for IPD.",

While a numerous of disease-causing genes and risk factors have been identified, the exact etiological mechanisms of AD are not yet completely understood, due to the inability to test theoretical hypotheses on non-postmortem and patient-specific research systems. The use of recently developed and optimized induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology may provide a promising platform to create reliable models, not only for better understanding the etiopathological process of AD, but also for efficient anti-AD drugs screening. More importantly, human-sourced iPSCs may also provide a beneficial tool for cell-replacement therapy against AD. Although considerable progress has been achieved, a number of key challenges still require to be addressed in iPSCs research, including the identification of robust disease phenotypes in AD modeling and the clinical availabilities of iPSCs-based cell-replacement therapy in human. In this review, we highlight recent progresses of iPSCs research and discuss the translational challenges of AD patients-derived iPSCs in disease modeling and cell-replacement therapy.",

Although PD has been heavily researched, the precise etiology and pathogenesis for PD are still inconclusive. Consequently, current pharmacological treatments for PD are largely symptomatic rather than preventive and there is still no cure for this disease nowadays. Moreover, nonmotor symptoms caused by intrinsic PD pathology or side effects induced by currently used pharmacological interventions are gaining increasing attention and urgently need to be treated due to their influence on quality of life. As ancient traditional healing systems, Tai Chi, Yoga, acupuncture and natural products have long been considered as complementary or alternative therapeutic options for PD. Recently, several newly developed non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies, including deep brain stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, near-infrared light, gene therapy and cell replacement therapy, have also been suggested to give benefits to relieve parkinsonian symptoms. This review will summarize and update the therapeutic potential and the most recent research progresses of these traditional and modern therapeutic options and highlight their clinical meaning for the therapy of not only PD but also other neurodegenerative diseases.",

The locomotor activity and cognitive performance of mice were evaluated using open field test and Morris water maze test, respectively. On day 23, all animals were sacrificed, and the hippocampus was used for biochemical, neurochemical and neuroinflammatory determinations. Our data revealed that the ICV-STZ-infused sAD mouse showed an increased oxidative-nitrosative stress, an altered neurotransmission and an elevated neuroinflammation in hippocampus, as well as significant cognitive deficits. All these alterations can be ameliorated by piperine in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, our findings predict a therapeutic potential of piperine against cognitive deficits in sAD mouse. This effect might be due to its abilities to ameliorate oxidative-nitrosative stress, restore neurotransmission and reduce neuroinflammation.",

        "abstract": "Epilepsy is a severe brain disorder affecting numerous patients. Recently, it is inferred that modulation of microRNA-155 (miR-155) could serve as a promising treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. In the current study, the therapeutic potential of miR-155 antagonist against temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was evaluated and the underlying mechanism involved in this regulation was explored. TLE model was induced by lithium-pilocarpine method. The effect of miR-155 antagonist on epilepticus symptoms of TLE mice was assessed using Racine classification and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its association with miR-155 were also assessed with a series of experiments. Our results showed that level of miR-155 was significantly up-regulated after induction of TLE model. Based on the results of EEG and behavior analyses, seizures in mice were alleviated by miR-155 antagonist. Moreover, administration of miR-155 antagonist also significantly increased the level of BDNF. The results of dual luciferase assay and Western blotting showed that miR-155 antagonist exerted its action on status epilepticus by directly regulating the activity of BDNF. Taken all the information together, our results demonstrated that miR-155 antagonist might firstly induce the expression of BDNF, which then contributed to the alleviation of epilepsy in the current study.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the correction results of traditional dual growing rods (DGRs) on axial rotation using CT scans and to further explore the relationships between axial and torso deformities in patients with early-onset scoliosis (EOS). METHODS Patients with EOS who were treated with traditional DGRs between January 2006 and December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree of coronal and sagittal deformity. The apical vertebral rotation (AVR) and rib hump (RH) were measured on CT scans at the apical vertebra. Pearson or Spearman rank correlation analyses were used to analyze the associations between spinal and torso deformities. RESULTS A total of 27 patients (10 boys and 17 girls, average age 6.5 \u00b1 1.7 years) were enrolled in this study. The average number of lengthenings per patient was 5.0 \u00b1 1.9, with a mean follow-up duration of 52.9 \u00b1 18.2 months. The apical vertebral translation, apical vertebral body-rib ratio (AVB-R), AVR, and RH parameters were significantly decreased after the initial surgery (p < 0.05) but showed notable progression at the latest follow-up evaluation (p < 0.05). The preoperative AVR and its correction after index surgery were significantly correlated with the preoperative values as well as with the corrections of the major Cobb angle, AVB-R, and RH. During the follow-up period, significant correlations were found between the deterioration of AVR and the AVB-R and also between the deterioration of AVR and the RH from the initial surgery to the latest follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Significant AVR correction can be achieved by DGR techniques after the initial surgery. However, this technique weakly prevents the deterioration of AVR during the follow-up period.",

        "abstract": "A retrospective study.To determine the incidence and risk factors of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) in young children who underwent posterior instrumented spinal fusion.PJK is a well-recognized postoperative complication in adults and adolescents. However, there is a paucity of valid data with regard to PJK in young children with congenital scoliosis who were treated with posterior correction surgery.This study reviewed the charts and radiographs of a consecutive series of young children with CS who underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion (\u22654 levels) from January 2008 to May 2013. The patients were followed up for more than 24 months. Radiographic measurements were made preoperatively and throughout the follow-up period. From sagittal images, the following values were obtained: proximal junctional angle, sagittal vertical axis, pelvic incidence, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and segmental kyphosis.Totally 113 children were recruited in this study. The average age at surgery was 6.6 years, and the average follow-up period was 48.8 months. PJK occurred in 21 of the 113 patients and were mostly classified as ligamentous failure. In comparison with the non-PJK group, the PJK group showed greater preoperative TK (45.9\u00b0 vs. 37.3\u00b0, P\u200a=\u200a0.027), longer fusion levels (6.6 vs. 5.4, P\u200au003c\u200a0.01) and greater SK change (30.1\u00b0 vs. 11.2\u00b0, P\u200a=\u200a0.002). Both a change in SK greater than 30\u00b0 and a preoperative TK greater than 40\u00b0 were independent risk factors associated with PJK. In the PJK group, the average PJA increased by 12.4\u00b0 at 3 months postoperatively and followed by slight improvement till the final follow-up.This study demonstrates a high rate of PJK in young children after correction surgery for CS. PJK mainly occurs within 3 months postoperatively and its risk factors include preoperative hyperkyphosis, over-correction of kyphosis and ligamentous failure.Level of Evidence: 4",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVEAs scoliosis in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is unusual and the number of cases reviewed in previous studies is also relatively small, no previous study exists that has directly compared the results of spinal deformity correction between AMC and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. The aim of this study was to compare the radiographic and clinical outcomes of surgical correction of spinal deformity associated with AMC versus AIS.METHODSTwenty-four adolescents with AMC were matched with 48 AIS patients in terms of Cobb angle of main curve, curve pattern, sex, age at surgery, Risser grade, and length of follow-up. Patients in both groups underwent posterior-only spinal correction and fusion procedures. The surgical outcomes and complications were analyzed and compared between the 2 groups.RESULTSIn comparison to the AIS group, the AMC group had a significantly longer mean operation time (5.6 vs 4.4 hours, p = 0.002), more blood loss (1620 \u00b1 250 ml vs 840 \u00b1 260 ml, p < 0.001), and more fusion levels (14.1 \u00b1 2.3 levels vs 12.4 \u00b1 2.5 levels, p = 0.007) as well as a lower correction rate (44.3% \u00b1 11.1% vs 70.8% \u00b1 12.4%, p < 0.001) and a higher rate of loss of correction (5.0% \u00b1 3.1% vs 2.1% \u00b1 1.9%, p < 0.001). Nine patients in the AMC group had preoperative pelvic obliquity, which was corrected from a mean of 14.2\u00b0 \u00b1 8.4\u00b0 to a mean of 4.3\u00b0 \u00b1 3.2\u00b0 (p < 0.001) after the surgery. The thoracic lordosis and sagittal vertical axis were significantly improved in the AMC group. Notably, however, the AMC group was found to have higher rates of screw malpositioning (15.9% vs 9.5%, p = 0.002) and complications (8/24 [33.3%] vs 4/48 [8.3%], p = 0.016) as compared to the AIS group.CONCLUSIONSCorrection of AMC-associated scoliosis tends to require a longer operating time and involve more fusion levels but results in less correction, more blood loss, and more complications, in comparison with AIS. In addition, more attention should be paid to pelvic obliquity and sagittal hyperlordosis in AMC patients.",

        "abstract": "Background  Clinical and radiographic degenerative spondylolisthesis (CARDS) classification defines a distinct subset of patients with kyphotic angulation at the involved segment (type D). Research using CARDS classification to investigate motion characteristics at involved segments or patient-related outcomes (PROs) following surgical intervention is sparse. We investigated the relationship between CARDS type D spondylolisthesis and dynamic instability and PROs in type D versus non\u2013type D spondylolisthesis.    Methods  We reviewed consecutive patients who received transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for L4-5 spondylolisthesis between 2009 and 2015. Patients were assigned into type D and non\u2013type D groups. Translational motion was determined by upright lumbar lateral radiography with supine sagittal magnetic resonance imaging or flexion and extension radiography. Demographics, radiographic parameters, and PROs were evaluated.    Results  Type D and non\u2013type D groups comprised 34 and 163 patients, respectively. Compared with non\u2013type D, type D group was characterized by lordotic angulation loss and higher degree of olisthesis on upright radiographs and demonstrated higher translational motion on upright lumbar lateral radiography with supine sagittal magnetic resonance imaging analysis. After surgery, mean reduction rate was significantly higher in type D group; type D had less slippage, but differences in slip angle and disc height were not significant. Preoperative Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale for back pain scores were higher in type D group. Type D spondylolisthesis and dynamic instability were associated with achieving minimal clinically important differences in PROs.    Conclusions  CARDS type D spondylolisthesis is a distinct subset associated with dynamic instability and worse PROs. Higher improvement in PROs can be achieved in CARDS type D spondylolisthesis after surgery.",

A dual dependence of peak current on sweeping rate, which can be attributed for the accumulation of reaction products, was observed on the sensor. Electrochemical analysis of the particulate Cu 2O for detecting H 2O 2 and glucose is described, showing remarkable sensitivity in both cases. The estimated detection limits and sensitivities for H 2O 2 (0.0039 \u03bcM, 52.3 mA mM -1 cm -2) and glucose (47.2 \u03bcM, 0.19 mA mM -1 cm -2) suggest that the response for H 2O 2 detection was much higher than for glucose detection. Electron microscopy observation suggested that the hierarchical structures of Cu 2O resulting from self-assembly of nanocrystals are responsible for the specific electrochemical properties. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The emission intensity of the HPHEp in ethanol solution continuously arises in pace with raising its concentration, and the brightest luminescence is observed even in the 100% solid state. Studies show that the aggregation of oxygen-rich heteroatoms from the hydroxyl and epoxy groups is assigned to the luminous source. Intriguingly, the HPHEp displays reinforced photoluminescence after polyetherification by 20 wt% polyether amine M2070; nevertheless, the modified polymer represents diminished emission intensity along with increasing the polyether content. Thus, this investigation offers a new methodology of designing photoluminescent materials.",

And then the bismaleimide (BMI) matrix composites with aligned GNS-Fe 3 O 4 @PZM are fabricated under a magnetic field to take full advantage of the tribological properties of graphene. Characterization results reveal that the 0.8\u00a0wt% aligned GNS-Fe 3 O 4 @PZM/BMI composite has the lowest friction coefficient and volume wear rate compared with non-aligned GNS-Fe 3 O 4 @PZM/BMI and aligned GNS-Fe 3 O 4 /BMI composites under all the test conditions. In addition, the aligned GNS-Fe 3 O 4 @PZM/BMI also shows superior mechanical properties and thermal stability. The excellent properties of aligned GNS-Fe 3 O 4 @PZM/BMI result from uniformly distribution and parallel alignment of graphene in the BMI matrix, as well as good interface interaction between GNS-Fe 3 O 4 @PZM and BMI matrix.",

We investigate for the first time bismaleimide (BMI) toughening effect using the fabricated polymer, and a series of SHBEp/BMI thermosets are then constructed, and then their mechanical properties like impact strength, flexural strength, and thermal stability are studied; meanwhile the toughening effect of SHBEp and conventional epoxy resin E51 is also compared. The results indicate that a proper addition of SHBEp (8 wt%) can significantly improve the toughness and thermal performance of thermosets compared to E51 with the same content. It is, therefore, revealed that the polymer is promising to act as an effective BMI toughener. Unexpectedly, a bright blue photoluminescence is observed when the SHBEp is excited under 365 nm UV light, and its average fluorescence lifetime and absolute fluorescence quantum yield are 4.30 ns and 4.61% respectively. It is demonstrated by our primary investigation that the epoxide and hydroxyl groups simultaneously help the light emission. Thus, the SHBEp bearing unconventional chromophores is also particularly expected to be a new light-emitting material.",

Then the as-prepared Srp@Fe3O4/OA particles were firstly mixed with bismaleimide resin (BMI) to constructe a series of Srp@Fe3O4/OA/BMI composites, the mechanical properties, tribological properties and thermal stability of the Srp@Fe3O4/OA/BMI composites are subsequently investigated.

The significantly enhanced toughness and tribological performance of the Srp@Fe3O4/OA/BMI composites are mainly due to the increase of the free volume and the uniformly distribution of Srp@Fe3O4/OA, as well as the good interfacial adhesion between BMI matrix and Srp@Fe3O4/OA particles.",

The structure had been characterized by IR spectra and NMR spectra. Dicyclopentadiene bisphenol dicyanate ester (DCPDCE) composites were then prepared using P-POSS and E-POSS respectively. Their effect on the curing kinetics, dielectric, mechanical, flame-retardant and thermal properties and water absorption of the resulting composites were investigated. The results suggested that the addition of modified POSS could facilitate the curing reaction of DCPDCE. Besides, the DCPDCE composites containing modified POSS exhibited excellent flame-retardant property over pure DCPDCE resin. Adding only a little amount as small as 1.5\u00a0wt% P-POSS or 2.5\u00a0wt% E-POSS could change the UL-94V of DCPDCE resin from V-2 to V-0. The composite with P-POSS exhibited better flame-retardant and thermal properties than the composite with E-POSS.

When 6.0 wt.% P-POSS was introduced into DBMI matrix, char yield at 800 \u00b0C increased by ~31.5 %, meanwhile UL-94 V-0 rating and 35.4 LOI (limiting oxide index) were also obtained. And compared with DBMI, the flexural strength and impact strength of 6.0 wt.% P-POSS/DBMI were enhanced 42.3 % and 30.8 %, respectively. Interestingly, the impact strength of 2.0 wt.% P-POSS/DBMI increased to 30.5 kJ/m2, about 136 % higher than that of DBMI.",

        "abstract": "One-pot polycondensation reaction of triethoxyvinylsilane (A-151) with excessive neopentyl glycol (NPG) is employed as an efficient and facile methodology for the synthesis of novel hyperbranched polysiloxanes contemporaneously bearing plenty of unconjugated carbon\u2013carbon double bonds and hydroxyl groups (HPUHs). Interestingly, the obtained HPUHs obviously without containing conventional chromophores exhibit conspicuous ultraviolet absorbency and bright blue photoluminescence when irradiated by a UV lamp with 365 nm wavelength. The excitation and emission intensities of the as-prepared polymers progressively grow along with raising their molecular weights and concentrations, and even the brightest blue glow in the solid state is observed, suggesting the emission intensity is molecular-weight and concentration-dependent. The preliminary investigation indicates that both the carbon\u2013carbon double bond and the hydroxyl group are very important in the formation of blue-luminescent species. Thus, this work opens a new route to design new light-emitting materials.",

In this design, we first introduce tapered optical fiber interferometer into electrophoresis system to dynamically on-line monitor the separation of the proteins. The tapered optical fiber interferometer is embedded into the separating medium of the electrophoresis system. The mixture of the proteins with negative charge driven by electric field in the separation gel can be separated and contact with the embedded fiber taper. When the separated components pass through the taper, the refractive index (RI) of the gel around the taper was dynamically adjusted and the interference spectra will present a reversible shift. To visually display the on-line separation and detection process, two kinds of simple proteins of Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Chicken egg albumin (CEA) labeled with fluorescence indicator are adopted as the analytes in the device. Results show that a trace amount of the proteins (5\u00a0\u03bcl) can be completely separated in the separation gel. Simultaneously, when each component contacts with the tapered region of the optical fiber, interference spectra immediately presents an obvious change because of the dynamic change of the refractive index of the transparent polymer gel. In addition, the complex fixing and developing steps in traditional electrophoresis analysis can be replaced by on-line detection through interference spectra. Then, simultaneous separating treatment and dynamic detection of the proteins are first realized in this experiment. Significantly, this fiber taper integrated separating and on-line detecting device can find great potentials in various analysis fields involves composite samples such as DNA separation and even the virus and cell research.",

This work aimed to improve the enzymatic properties of Rhizopus oryzae \u03b1-amylase by site-saturation mutagenesis of histidine 286. The biochemical properties of selected mutant enzymes were modified to increase their enzymatic efficiencies compared to their wild-type counterparts. For instance, the optimum temperature of mutants H286\u202fL, H286I, H286S and H286\u202fT was increased from 50\u202f\u00b0C to 55\u202f\u00b0C, while a similar increase was observed for H286\u202fP from 50\u202f\u00b0C to 60\u202f\u00b0C. The optimum pH of mutants H286\u202fL, H286I and H286D shifted from 5.5 to 5.0, and the optimum pH of mutant H286E shifted from 5.5 to 4.5. The results obtained showed that the mutant H286I showed a 1.5-fold increase in half-life at 55\u202f\u00b0C and the mutant H286E showed a 6.43-fold increase in half-life at a pH of 4.5. Furthermore, the ability to form maltose from soluble starch for mutants H286\u202fL and H286\u202fM was significantly improved under the optimum conditions determined in the study. The catalytic mechanism responsible for improved maltose-forming ability was confirmed through molecular docking simulations with maltotriose among wild-type and mutant enzymes. The mutants with improved enzymatic properties that were attained in this work may help in future computer-aided directed evolution of fungal \u03b1-amylase.",

Acidic adaptation of pullulanases is of special interest. In this study, we conducted protein engineering to improve the acidic adaptation of Bacillus acidopullulyticus pullulanase (BaPul) and used a hydrogen-bond-based approach to identify promising residues that may change the deprotonation constants (pK) of the catalytic residues. A total of 19 amino acids were selected for mutation according to the crystal structure of BaPul. The pH optimum of the L627R mutant shifted from 5.0 to 4.0, and its relative activity at pH 4.0 was 117% that of the wide-type enzyme. The improved efficacy of the L627R mutant at pH 4.0 was confirmed by kinetic parameters and pK prediction. Moreover, the L627R mutant exhibited increased tolerance against acid-mediated denaturation, and its maximum d-glucose content (97.4%) was obtained after 40\u2009h incubation, which is shorter by 10\u2009h compared with the time required by the wide-type enzyme to produce a comparable amount of the monosaccharide. The L627R mutant may be suitable for industrial application because its shortened reaction time translates to reduced energy consumption.",

The investigation of the photoluminescence (PL) measurement demonstrates that the luminescence characteristics of the Nd 3+  ions are not significantly altered by the Si ions irradiation process, whereas the up-conversion (UC) luminescence intensity can be effectively improved.

Due to the magnitude of genome-wide studies, resolution is often sacrificed in favor of throughput, creating a demand for scalable, time-resolved, quantitative methods of growth assessment. We present ODELAY (One-cell Doubling Evaluation by Living Arrays of Yeast), an automated and scalable growth analysis platform. High measurement density and single-cell resolution provide a powerful tool for large-scale multiparameter growth analysis based on the modeling of microcolony expansion on solid media. Pioneered in yeast but applicable to other colony forming organisms, ODELAY extracts the three key growth parameters (lag time, doubling time, and carrying capacity) that define microcolony expansion from single cells, simultaneously permitting the assessment of population heterogeneity. The utility of ODELAY is illustrated using yeast mutants, revealing a spectrum of phenotypes arising from single and combinatorial growth parameter perturbations.",

Each growth phase can reveal different aspects of fitness that are related to various environmental and genetic conditions. High-resolution and quantitative measurements of all 3 phases of growth are generally difficult to obtain. Here we present a detailed method to characterize all 3 growth phases on solid media using an assay called One-cell Doubling Evaluation of Living Arrays of Yeast (ODELAY). ODELAY quantifies growth phenotypes of individual cells growing into colonies on solid media using time-lapse microscopy. This method can directly observe population heterogeneity with each growth parameter in genetically identical cells growing into colonies. This population heterogeneity offers a unique perspective for understanding genetic and epigenetic regulation, and responses to genetic and environmental perturbations. While the ODELAY method is demonstrated using yeast, it can be utilized on any colony forming microorganism that is visible by bright field microscopy.",

Probabilistic Regulation Of Metabolism (PROM) provides a partial solution, but it does not incorporate network inference and underperforms in eukaryotes. We present an Integrated Deduced And Metabolism (IDREAM) method that combines statistically inferred Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) models with the PROM framework to create enhanced metabolic-regulatory network models. We used IDREAM to predict phenotypes and genetic interactions between transcription factors and genes encoding metabolic activities in the eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. IDREAM models contain many fewer interactions than PROM and yet produce significantly more accurate growth predictions. IDREAM consistently outperformed PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions. Importantly, IDREAM's enhanced accuracy makes it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects. With experimental validation, these novel genetic interactions involving the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex suggested a new role for fatty acid-responsive factor Oaf1 in regulating acetyl-CoA production in glucose grown cells.",

As an important element of e-commerce, many Internet companies such as Yahoo! and eBay have launched electronic auction systems. However, like most electronic commerce products, safety is an important issue that should be addressed. Many researchers have proposed secure electronic auction mechanisms, but we found that some of them do not exhibit the property of unlinkability, which leads to the leakage of users\u2019 privacy. Considering the importance of privacy preservation, we have designed a new auction mechanism. Through symmetrical key establishment in the registration phase, all messages transmitted over the Internet would be protected and, meanwhile, achieve the property of unlinkability. The security analysis and performance analysis show that our protocol fulfills more security properties and is more efficient for implementation compared with recent works.",

However, due to the small size of sensor devices and weak capabilities in data processing/storage, WBAN is limited in application. In order to improve the ability of WBAN system and provide a richer service, the cloud-assisted WBAN has been proposed. Recently, He et al. proposed a method to check the data integrity in cloud-assisted WBAN. However, we found that in their scheme, the cloud server (storage service provider) can access the user's medical information directly. As we know, the cloud service provider can be divided into three kinds: public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud. Except of the private cloud, the cloud server should be considered as not trusted in the other two situations. Based on this assumption, in this paper, we proposed a certificateless public auditing scheme with privacy preserving and revocation in group sharing data model. Compared with He et al.'s scheme, the cloud server can not access any useful information from the stored data. Furthermore, our scheme supports properties of multi-user sharing data, public auditing, forward security and revocation of illegal group members.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) are gaining importance in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). The modern medical system is a particular area where the WBSN techniques are being increasingly adopted for various fundamental operations. Despite such increasing deployments of WBSNs, issues such as the infancy in the size, capabilities and limited data processing capacities of the sensor devices restrain their adoption in resource-demanding applications. Though providing computing and storage supplements from cloud servers can potentially enrich the capabilities of the WBSNs devices, data security is one of the prevailing issues that affects the reliability of cloud-assisted services. Sensitive applications such as modern medical systems demand assurance of the privacy of the users' medical records stored in distant cloud servers. Since it is economically impossible to set up private cloud servers for every client, auditing data security managed in the remote servers has necessarily become an integral requirement of WBSNs' applications relying on public cloud servers. To this end, this paper proposes a novel certificateless public auditing scheme with integrated privacy protection. The multi-user model in our scheme supports groups of users to store and share data, thus exhibiting the potential for WBSNs' deployments within community environments. Furthermore, our scheme enriches user experiences by offering public verifiability, forward security mechanisms and revocation of illegal group members. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the security effectiveness of our proposed scheme under the Random Oracle Model (ROM) by outperforming existing cloud-assisted WBSN models.",

        "abstract": "From smart watch to remote healthcare system, wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs) play an important role in modern healthcare system. However, the weak capacity of devices has limited WBSNs development. Considering the huge processing and storage capacity of the cloud, it can be merged with WBSNs to make up for the deficiencies of weak capacity. Based on this consideration, the concept of cloud-assisted WBSNs has been proposed recently. In contrast to generic data, the data in cloud-assisted WBSNs will be used for providing medical diagnosis, so the integrity of data is very important because any modification will result in severe consequences such as misdiagnosis. The public auditing scheme could provide an efficient solution to check the data integrity remotely without downloading them. However, the traditional public auditing scheme for cloud cannot be used directly due to the high data density and weak processing capacity in WBSNs. So, in this paper, we proposed a lightweight and efficient public auditing scheme, LEPA, for cloud-assisted WBSNs. Compared with similar schemes, the WBSNs\u2019 client only needs to do one symmetrical encryption with low computational cost in LEPA. Security proof shows that LEPA can resist two types of adversaries in random oracle model. The efficiency evaluation also shows that LEPA outperforms previous proposals.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the biological role of transglutaminase 3 (TGM3) in malignant transformation of OL and its clinical value for predicting oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) risk in patients with OL. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure TGM3 expression in OL samples from 98 patients. Patient clinicopathological and follow-up data were analyzed. The TGM3 biological role in OL cells was investigated in gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays, and the TGM3 downregulated mechanism in OLs was characterized. TGM3 mRNA and protein expressions were frequently downregulated in OL cells and samples. DNA hypermethylation was a mechanism of TGM3 downregulation. TGM3 overexpression and silencing affected the proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis of OL cells through apoptosis-related protein dysregulations. Lower TGM3 levels were strongly associated with the grade of epithelial dysplasia and OSCC development. Multivariate analyses showed that TGM3 was the only independent predictor for malignant transformation of OL. Collectively, these data indicated that TGM3 played an important role in OL malignant transformation and may serve as a predictor to identify OL with OSCC development.",

        "abstract": "Peritoneal metastasis is the most common pathway for the spread of ovarian cancer and one of the major causes of cancer death. Ovarian cancer cells in ascites prefer to aggregate into the multicellular spheroids (MCS) with an inadequate response to chemotherapy. In this study, gene expression analysis implicated that ovarian cancer MCS had its unique expression pattern and the cell cycle-related pathways were prominently altered in MCS cells compared to the monolayer adherent cells. Flow cytometry and western blots confirmed the cell cycle stagnancy in MCS. Among the cell cycle-related proteins, we found that expression of CDC25A was upregulated in MCS and displayed a time-dependent decrease during the transition from MCS to monolayer adherent cells. Loss-of-function studies showed that CDC25A promoted cisplatin-resistance and paclitaxel-resistance and inhibited the drug-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer MCS. Mechanically, CDC25A impeded cell cycle progression in MCS cells, enhanced their structure integrity, and maintained upregulation of E-cadherin in MCS cells. Accordingly, addition of NSC95397, a small molecular inhibitor of CDC25A, sensitized the ovarian cancer MCS to chemotherapeutic agents. This provides us a novel strategy for the treatment of ovarian cancer peritoneal metastasis and may help improve the overall survival of ovarian cancer patients.",

Conventional MN patch fabrication methods typically can load only one or possibly multiple miscible agents with the same formulation on all MNs, which limits the combination and spatial distribution of drugs and formulations having different properties (such as solubility) in a single patch. In this study, we coated MNs individually instead of coating all MNs from the same formulation, making possible a patch where each individual MN is coated with different formulations and drugs. In this way, individually coated MN patches co-delivered multiple agents with different physicochemical characteristics (immiscible molecules, proteins, and nanoparticles) and in different spatial patterns in the skin. MN loading was adjusted by modifying the number of coating layers, and co-delivery of multiple agents was demonstrated in the porcine skin. We conclude that individually coating MNs enables co-delivery of multiple different compounds and formulations with needle-by-needle spatial control in the skin.",

Differences in patient demographics, genetics, socioeconomic conditions, clinical practice patterns and regulatory policies provide us with empirical data and sometimes natural experiments to answer questions that are either impractical or unethical to answer with randomised control trials. In the realm of advanced heart failure therapies, ventricular assist devices and heart transplantation have been widely adopted therapies in the USA, Canada and Europe. Facing different regulations on device indication (bridge to transplant (BTT) vs destination therapy (DT)), donor heart availability and heart allocation priority systems, how does the experience of left ventricular assist device\u00a0(LVAD) therapy compare in these different regions? Does longer transplant waiting time significantly impact the effectiveness and complications of BTT LVAD therapy?

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, the effects of diesel/gasoline/iso-butanol blends, including pure diesel (D100), diesel (70%)/gasoline (30%) (D70G30, by mass), diesel (70%)/iso-butanol (30%) (D70B30) and diesel (70%)/gasoline (15%)/iso-butanol (15%) (D70G15B15), on combustion and exhaust pollutant emissions characteristics in a four-cylinder diesel engine were experimentally investigated under various engine load conditions with a constant speed of 1800\u00a0rpm. The results indicated that D70G30, D70G15B15 and D70B30 delayed the ignition timing and shortened the combustion duration compared to D100. Additionally, CA50 was retarded when engine fuelled with D70G30, D70G15B15 and D70B30 at low engine load conditions, but it was advanced at medium and high engine loads. The maximum pressure rise rates (MPRRs) of D70G30, D70G15B15 and D70B30 were increased compared with D100 except for at engine load of 0.13\u00a0MPa BMEP (brake mean effective pressure). Meanwhile, D70G15B15 and D70B30 produced higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) than that of D100. The effects of diesel blend with gasoline or iso-butanol on exhaust pollutant emissions were varied with loads. CO emissions were increased obviously and NOx emissions were decreased under low engine loads. However, CO emissions were decreased and NOx emissions were slightly increased under the medium and high engine load conditions. However, D70G30, D70G15B15 and D70B30 leaded to higher HC emissions than D100 regardless the variation of engine load. Moreover, the particulate matter (PM) (diameter, number and mass concentrations) emissions by using D70G30, D70G15B15 and D70B30 were significantly reduced compared to D100, but more small-size particles were produced.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An experimental study was conducted on a four-cylinder diesel engine added with 0%, 10% and 30% 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). The combustion characteristic, nitric oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions under different fuel injection timing were measured and well discussed, especially the particle size distribution (PSD), particle number and mass concentration. The results indicated that the ignition delay time was prolonged with further addition of DMF, the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was improved, and the diesel-equivalent brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was reduced. It was interesting to note that the maximum cylinder pressure increased slightly with the 10% DMF addition under all of the studied engine conditions, but those with 30% DMF addition were more complex. For PM emission, the particles emitted by the engine are dominated by nucleation mode (NM) particles regardless of injection timing and the amount of DMF addition. Injection timing has a distinct effect on PSDs due to different combustion characteristics. The DMF addition decreases the number of accumulation mode (AM) particles but increases the NM number, which may be more harmful to humans and the environment. The geometric mean diameter (GMD) of particles are also declined with DMF addition due to the increase of NM number. The trade-off relationship between NOx and soot can be solved slightly when the engine fueled with DMF-diesel under suitable injection timing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Aluminum phosphate (AlPO 4 ) is a promising oxidation-resistant and weak interface for ceramic-matrix composites. In this research, AlPO 4  coating was deposited on mullite fibers by an improved liquid-phase method based on electrostatic attraction. A cationic polyelectrolyte, polyethylenimine (PEI), was used for surface modification of mullite fibers. The formation process, phase evolution and microstructure of the coating were studied. The zeta potential of AlPO 4  particles, PEI-adsorbed AlPO 4  particles, and PEI-adsorbed mullite particles was characterized to find the proper pH value for improving electrostatic attraction. The obtained AlPO 4  coating was porous and continuous, whose thickness could be controlled by multiple coating cycles. The relatively low calcination temperature (600 or 1000\u00a0\u00b0C) was a useful heat treatment method to develop bonding between coating and fiber as well as reduce the fiber strength degradation. The phase transformations of AlPO 4  have little volume change, and cristobalite AlPO 4  is thermal compatible with mullite. Therefore, the coating structure was preserved after calcining at 1200\u00a0\u00b0C. The technique is also applicable for other fibers contained mullite phase to fabricate high-performance AlPO 4  coated mullite/mullite composites.",

        "title": "The effects of NO3\u2212 and Cl\u2212 on negatively charged clay aggregation",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Farmer\u2019s experiences told us that, NO 3  \u2212  could strongly decrease soil aggregate stability and compact the soil, thus increase tillage difficulty and decrease tillage quality, but Cl \u2212  could not. It implies that, even though soil particles are often with net negative charges, NO 3  \u2212  and Cl \u2212  could cause different effects on soil particle interactions. The purpose of present study is to examine whether and how those two anions could influence the negatively charged clay particles interaction. In this study, the technique of multi-angle dynamic light scattering was used to study the aggregation kinetics of montmorillonite for the presence of NO 3  \u2212  and Cl \u2212  respectively. The results showed that, the aggregation rate of montmorillonite particles in NO 3  \u2212  solution was much lower than that in Cl \u2212  solution, and correspondingly the critical coagulation concentration and the activation energy for the presence of NO 3  \u2212  was much higher than that for the presence of Cl \u2212 . Zeta potential measurements implied that, the electrostatic repulsive force among the montmorillonite particles for the presence of NO 3  \u2212  would be much higher than that for the presence of Cl \u2212 , because the zeta potential of montmorillonite in NO 3  \u2212  solution was much higher than that in Cl \u2212  solution. Further measurements for the anion adsorption quantities showed that, under given solution conditions the adsorption quantity of NO 3  \u2212  was much higher than Cl \u2212 . We speculate that, the non-classic polarization of anion might be a possible explanation for those observations. Our study might give a reasonable explanation that NO 3  \u2212  could strongly decrease soil aggregate stability and tillage quality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Many studies have shown that K +  has more favourable effects on soil water infiltration than Na + , which is a result of specific ion effects or Hofmeister effects. In this study, we employed four alkali metal cation species (Li + , Na + , K + , and Cs + ) to determine how the particle interactions influence the water infiltration in a soil with permanent surface charges. Moreover, the defined Hofmeister energy was employed to characterize the specific ion effects. The DLVO force plus the hydration force between two adjacent soil particles mainly determines water infiltration rate through affecting the soil pore-size distribution, which exhibits strong specific ion effects. The hydration force may originate from the surface hydration of soil particles and the hydration of cations in the double layer. The hydration pressure between adjacent soil particles was complexly influenced by electrolyte concentration, Debye length, cationic distribution in the double layer through the Hofmeister energy of cation.",

        "abstract": "Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) by bilateral or unilateral approach is widely used in palliative abdominal pain management in pancreatic cancer patients, but the analgesic effect and relative risks of the two different puncture routes remain controversial.The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of bilateral EUS-CPN compared with unilateral EUS-CPN.An electronic database search was performed for randomized controlled trials comparing bilateral and unilateral approaches of EUS-CPN using the Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and CNKI databases. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 after screening and methodological evaluation of the selected studies. Outcomes included pain relief, treatment response, analgesic reduction, complications, and quality of life (QOL).Six eligible studies involving 437 patients were included. No significant difference was found in short-term pain relief [SMD = 0.31, 95% CI (- 0.20, 0.81), P = 0.23] and response to treatment [RR = 0.99, 95% CI (0.77, 1.41), P = 0.97] between the bilateral and unilateral neurolysis groups. However, only the bilateral approach was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the postoperative use of analgesics [RR = 0.66, 95% CI (0.47, 0.94), P = 0.02] compared to the unilateral approach. A descriptive analysis was performed for complications and QOL.The short-term analgesic effect and general risk of bilateral EUS-CPN are comparable with those of unilateral EUS-CPN, but our evidence supports the conclusion that the bilateral approach significantly reduces postoperative analgesic use.",

In this study, 20 compounds were synthesized, based on this scaffold and their in\u00a0vitro cytotoxicity against 6 cancer cell lines, including EC9706, SMMC-7721, MCF7, PC3, MGC-803 and EC109 was tested. Among them, compound 6p, showed strong anti-proliferative activities on esophageal carcinoma cells: EC9706 and EC109 with IC values of 1.09\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03 and 2.79\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.45\u202f\u03bcM, respectively. 6p also significantly induces both EC9706 and EC109\u202fcell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and cell apoptosis, as well as intracellular ROS accumulation, which could be markedly reversed caspase or ROS inhibitor: NAC. Meanwhile, treatment of compound 6p results in significant declined mitochondria membrane potential, increases in the expression of P53 and bax, as well as decrease in Bcl-2. 6p also activates caspase-8/9/3, PARP and Bid, indicating that 6p induces cancer cell apoptosis via the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway. Further studies also proved that 6p does not show obvious side effects at cellular and in\u00a0vivo levels. Our findings suggested that hydrazone derivative: compound 6p may serve as a lead compound for further optimization against esophageal cancer cells.",

It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first identified MOF that can retain its crystallinity and porosity in saturated sodium hydroxide solution (~20 mol/L) at room temperature and 100 oC. This almost pushes base-resistance of porphyrinic MOFs (even if MOFs) to the limit in aqueous media and greatly extends the range of their potential applications. In this work, we also tried to interpret the stability of PCN-601 from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives.",

        "abstract": "Adsorption and activation of molecules on a surface holds the key to heterogeneous catalysis toward aerobic oxidative reactions. To achieve high catalytic activities, a catalyst surface should be rationally tailored to interact with both organic substrates and oxygen molecules. Here, a facile bottom-up approach to defective tungsten oxide hydrate (WO3 \u00b7H2 O) nanosheets that contain both surface defects and lattice water is reported. The defective WO3 \u00b7H2 O nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic activity for aerobic coupling of amines to imines. The investigation indicates that the oxygen vacancies derived from surface defects supply coordinatively unsaturated sites to adsorb and activate oxygen molecules, producing superoxide radicals. More importantly, the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites from lattice water can contribute to enhancing the adsorption and activation of alkaline amine molecules. The synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Br\u00f8nsted acid sites eventually boosts the catalytic activity, which achieves a kinetic rate constant of 0.455 h(-1) and a turnover frequency of 0.85 h(-1) at 2 h, with the activation energy reduced to \u224835 kJ mol(-1) . This work provides a different angle for metal oxide catalyst design by maneuvering subtle structural features, and highlights the importance of synergistic effects to heterogeneous catalysts.",

A highly efficient electrocatalyst should possess both active sites and high conductivity; however, the loading of powder catalysts on electrodes may often suffer from the large resistance between catalysts and current collectors. This work reports a class of bulk amorphous NiFeP materials with metallic bonds from the viewpoint of electrode design. The materials reported here perfectly combine high macroscopic conductivity with surface active sites, and can be directly used as the electrodes with active sites toward high OER activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Specifically, a low overpotential of 219 mV is achieved at the geometric current density 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte, with the Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1) and intrinsic overpotential of 280 mV. Meanwhile, an overpotential of 540 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is attained in an acidic electrolyte and stable for over 30 h, which is the best OER performance in both alkaline and acidic media. This work provides a different angle for the design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts and facilitates the device applications of electrocatalysts.",

The NSWANs exhibit quite low HER and OER overpotentials of 174 and 295 mV, respectively, holding the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for 24 h continuous operations in alkaline media. Meanwhile, a cell voltage of 1.547 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting has been achieved by the NSWANs for the practical application, which could maintain fascinating activity of 20 mA cm(-2) for 72 h without degradation. The decorated NiOx NPs not only prevent the NiSe2 from further oxidation but also expose requisite active sites for electrocatalytic process. It is believed that this study may provide a valuable strategy to design high-efficiency electrocatalysts and expand the applications of selenide-based materials.",

        "abstract": "It is known that introducing metal nanoparticles (e.g., Fe and Co) into N-doped carbons can enhance the activity of N-doped carbons toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, introducing metals into N-doped carbons inevitably causes the formation of multiple active sites. Thus, it is challenging to identify the active sites and unravel mechanisms responsible for enhanced ORR activity. Herein, by developing a new N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-Co complex as the nitrogen- and metal-containing precursor, we report the synthesis of N-doped carbon nanosheets embedded with Co nanoparticles as highly active ORR catalysts without direct metal-nitrogen bonding. Electrochemical measurements and X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicate that the carbon-nitrogen sites surrounding Co nanoparticles are responsible for the observed ORR activity and stability. DFT calculations further reveal that Co nanoparticles could facilitate the protonation of O2 and thus promote the ORR activity. These results provide new prospects in rational design and synthesis of heteroatom-doped carbon materials as nonprecious metal catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.",

        "abstract": "Developing highly active and low-cost heterogeneous catalysts towards overall electrochemical water splitting is extremely desirable but still a challenge. Herein, we report pyrite NiS2 nanosheets doped with vanadium heteroatoms as bifunctional electrode materials for both hydrogen- and oxygen-evolution reaction (HER and OER). Notably, the electronic structure reconfiguration of pyrite NiS2 is observed from typical semiconductive characteristics to metallic characteristics by engineering vanadium (V) displacement defect, which is confirmed by both experimental temperature-dependent resistivity and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, elaborate X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that electronic structure reconfiguration of NiS2 is rooted in electron transfer from doped V to Ni sites, and consequently enabling Ni sites to gain more electrons. The metallic V-doped NiS2 nanosheets exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance with overpotentials of about 290 mV for OER and about 110 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2 with long-term stability in 1 M KOH solutions, representing one of the best non-noble-metal bifunctional electrocatalysts to date. This work provides insights into electronic structure engineering from well-designed atomic defect metal sulfide.",

        "abstract": "The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a highly important reaction that requires a relatively high overpotential and determines the rate of water splitting-a process for producing hydrogen. The overall OER performance is often largely limited by uncontrollable interface when active catalysts are loaded on conductive supports, for which polymer binders are widely used, but inevitably block species transportation channels. Here, a scalable fabrication approach to freestanding graphitized carbon nanofiber networks is reported, which provides abundant sites for in situ growing Fe/Ni catalysts with the improved interface. The fabricated hybrid membrane exhibits high activity and durability toward OER, with an overpotential of 280 mV at a geometrical current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1) in alkaline medium. As implemented as a freestanding electrode, the 3D hybrid structure achieves further enhanced OER performance with an overpotential down to 215 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) . This work provides fresh insights into rationally fabricating OER electrocatalysts from the angle of electrode design.",

Here, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of sulfur-doped molybdenum oxide nanorings with an atomic-level size (thickness of 0.5\u2009nm) and a tunable ring-in-ring architecture. These atomic-level nanorings displayed strong photo-absorption in both the visible and infrared-light ranges and acted as a photothermal agent. Under irradiation with an 808\u2009nm laser with an intensity of 1\u2009W/cm(2), a composite of the nanorings embedded in polydimethylsiloxane showed an ultrafast photothermal effect, delivering a local temperature of up to 400\u2009\u00b0C within 20\u2009s, which to the best of our knowledge is the highest temperature by light irradiation reported to date. Meanwhile, the resulting nanorings were also employed as a photoinitiator to remotely induce a visible-light shape memory response, self-healing, reshaping performance and reversible actuation of dynamic three-dimensional structures. This study demonstrates an advancement towards controlling atomic-level-sized nanostructures and achieving greatly enhanced optical performances for optoelectronics.",

Combined with synchrotron radiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the soft X-ray absorption near-edge structure results confirmed that rich covalent interfacial Co\uf8ffN\uf8ffC bonds are efficiently formed between cobalt nanoparticles and wrapped carbon-layers during the polydopamine-assisted pyrolysis process. The X-ray absorption fine structure and corresponding extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra further reveal that the wrapped cobalt with Co-N coordinations shows distinct surface distortion and atomic environmental change of Co-based active sites.

        "abstract": "The concentration and small size of nanodiamonds (NDs) plays a crucial role in the mechanical performance of epoxy-based nanocomposites by modifying the interface strength. Herein, we systemically analyzed the relation between the high concentration and small size of ND and the fracture properties of its epoxy-based nanocomposites. It was observed that there is a two-fold increase in fracture toughness and a three-fold increase in fracture energy. Rationally, functionalized-NDs (F-NDs) showed a much better performance for the nanocomposite than pristine NDs (P-NDs) because of additional functional groups on its surface. The F-ND/epoxy nanocomposites exhibited rougher surface in contrast with the P-ND/epoxy, indicating the presence of a strong interface. We found that the interfaces in F-ND/epoxy nanocomposites at high concentrations of NDs overlap by making a web, which can efficiently hinder further crack propagation. In addition, the de-bonding in P-ND/epoxy nanocomposites occurred at the interface with the appearance of plastic voids or semi-naked particles, whereas the de-bonding for F-ND/epoxy nanocomposites happened within the epoxy molecular network instead of the interface. Because of the strong interface in F-ND/epoxy nanocomposites, at high concentrations the de-bonding within the epoxy molecular network may lead to subsequent cracks, parallel to the parent crack, via crack splitting which results in a fiber-like structure on the fracture surface. The plastic void growth, crack deflection and subsequent crack growth were correlated to higher values of fracture toughness and fracture energy in F-ND/epoxy nanocomposites.",

Such factors are geometric nonlinearity, material nonlinearity, geometric imperfection, concrete crush, concrete crack, aggregate interlocking, etc. The effects of the initial pier deflection, the construction load type and the rigidity of tied-beam on the stability of long-span prestressed concrete rigid-frame bridge during cantilever construction phase are discussed. Analysis and study results show that the mechanical characteristics of reinforced concrete have significant impact on the stability of long-span prestressed concrete rigid-frame bridge during cantilever construction phase. Structure stability coefficient decreases with the increase of the initial pier deflection according to parabola curves. The relationship between the rigidity of tied-beam and structure stability coefficient is in index curve. The unsymmetrical construction loads are dangerous to the stability of long-span prestressed concrete rigid-frame bridge during cantilever construction phase.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of the heat transfer theory, an analytical model is established for predicting the nonlinear temperature distributions in dumbbell cross section concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) arches subjected to solar radiation. The model takes into account the effects of the climatic conditions, location, orientation, geometry and the material properties of the CFST arch. A computer program module employing the FEM software ANSYS as its running platform is developed to implement this model numerically. Parametric studies are conducted to examine and discuss the effects of various parameters on the temperature distributions. The results indicate that the nonlinear difference in temperature over the cross sections due to solar radiation can be greater than 25\u00b0C under average conditions. The solar radiation absorptivity of the steel tube surface is the most significant factor that affects the difference in temperature.",

        "abstract": "Targeted delivery of functional oligonucleotides to pulmonary endothelium shows promise both as a novel therapeutics for the treatment of pulmonary diseases and as a research tool to study gene function in pulmonary endothelium. To this end, we have developed a novel lipidic vector that is highly efficient in targeted delivery to pulmonary endothelium of functional oligonucleotides including antisense ODN, siRNA and synthetic minigenes. This is based on a method that utilizes an ionizable aminolipid (1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium propane, DODAP) and an ethanol-containing buffer system for encapsulating large quantities of polyanionic ODN in lipid vesicles. An endothelium-specific antibody (34A) is incorporated into the lipid vesicles via a distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol) (DSPE-PEG) spacer. These vesicles are around 100-200 nm in diameter with an ODN entrapment efficiency of 60-80%. 34A antibody mediated efficient delivery of ODN to mouse lung endothelial cells in vitro and in intact mice. Furthermore, this formulation is associated with minimal proinflammatory cytokine response and other hematological toxicities. These results provide a basis for lipid-mediated delivery of ODN for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. They also suggest the utility of this approach as a research tool to characterize the function of genes in the pulmonary endothelium.",

        "abstract": "We have previously reported that intravenous administration of cationic lipid-protamine-DNA complexes (LPD) induces production of large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines that are toxic and cause inhibition of transgene expression. Cytokine induction appears to be mediated by the unmethylated CpG sequences since methylation of plasmid DNA significantly decreases the cytokine levels. In this study, the inhibitory role of CpG in lipid-mediated gene transfer was further investigated using chemically well-defined, CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). Injection (intravenous) of ODNs formulated in LPD into mice triggered production of proinflammatory cytokines including interferon gamma and TNF-alpha. The potency of CpG-containing ODNs in cytokine induction was affected by its flanking sequences and was significantly reduced when CpG was methylated. Preinjection of ODN-containing LPD led to inhibition of transgene expression in lungs after a subsequent injection of LPD containing plasmid expression vector with luciferase gene. The degree of inhibition correlated with the levels of ODN-triggered cytokines. Finally, intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone suppressed LPD-induced cytokine production, and led to significantly higher levels of transgene expression on both first and second injection. These studies suggest that mutation of potent CpG motifs in plasmid DNA together with the use of immune suppression agent may represent an effective approach to improve cationic lipid-mediated gene transfer to the lung.",

        "abstract": "The effects of three tillage methods, i.e., no tillage, rotary tillage, deep tillage, on tea garden soil compaction, soil moisture, soil bulk density, yield component factors and tea yield were studied through field experiments in Langxi Country of Anhui Province. The results indicated that the effects of three tillage methods on soil bulk density and soil compaction were in order of deep tillage>rotary tillage>no tillage. Deep tillage and rotary tillage could effectively break the argillic horizon layer and decrease the soil compaction. Compared with no tillage, soil compaction and soil bulk density (0-30 cm) under deep tillage decreased 16.4% and 13.4%-27.5%, respectively. Deep tillage could significantly increase soil water storage space and enhance the water holding capacity of the soil. Compared with no tillage, the soil moisture of 15-30 cm soil layer was increased by 7.7% under deep tillage. The different tillage methods had little effect on soil porosity. Rotary tillage and deep tillage could increase soil specific surface area and the ratios of soil gas and soil liquid. The diurnal changes of photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate of tea both exhibited double-peak pattern. There was a significant midday depression caused principally by stomatal factors. Under deep tillage, the tea leaf transpiration rate decreased, shoot density increased, 100-bud dry mass and water use efficiency increased significantly, and the tea yield increased by 17.6% and 6.8% compared with no tillage and rotary tillage, respectively. Deep tillage was the most appropriate tillage practice in tea garden of east Anhui Province.",

        "abstract": "In order to investigate the effect of nitrogen fertilizer on combined forms and transformation of fluorine in tea garden soil, soil pot experiment was carried out. The research object was red-yellow soil in Shizipu tea plantation in the south of Anhui Province. Five treatments were N0P0K0(CK), N0P1K1(N0), N1P1K1(N1), N2P1K1(N2), N3P1K1(N3). Water-soluble fluorine content, exchangeable fluorine content, Fe/Mn oxide-bound fluorine content, organic matter-bound fluorine content, ammonium nitrogen content and soil p H value in 0~15cm soil layer were analyzed in 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 90 days after fertilization. The results showed that compared with CK, in the short term(10or 20 days)after applying NPK, the content of water-soluble fluorine in 0~15 cm soil layer was decreased and the content of exchangeable fluorine, Fe/Mn oxide-bound fluorine and organic matter-bound fluorine were increased. After 20 days, the content of soil water-soluble fluorine was increased and the content of soil exchangeable fluorine, Fe/Mn oxide-bound fluorine and organic matter-bound fluorine were reduced. The effect on water-soluble fluorine and exchangeable fluorine increased with time and the application rate of nitrogen. The content of water-soluble fluorine in tea garden soil had a moderately positive correlation with the application rate of nitrogen while the content of exchangeable fluorine had a moderately or highly negative correlation with the application rate of nitrogen. The content of water-soluble fluorine had a quite highly negative correlation with the soil p H(P0.01), but the content of exchangeable fluorine had a moderately or highly negative correlation with the soil p H(P0.01). Therefore, nitrogen fertilizer changed the soil p H during its form transformation and thus affected the transformation and the availability of fluorine in soil.",

        "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a representation of relationships between regulators and their target genes. Several methods for GRN inference, both unsupervised and supervised, have been developed to date. Because regulatory relationships consistently reprogram in diverse tissues or under different conditions, GRNs inferred without specific biological contexts are of limited applicability. In this report, a machine learning approach is presented to predict GRNs specific to developing  embryos. We developed the Beacon GRN inference tool to predict GRNs occurring during seed development in Arabidopsis based on a support vector machine (SVM) model. We developed both global and local inference models and compared their performance, demonstrating that local models are generally superior for our application. Using both the expression levels of the genes expressed in developing embryos and prior known regulatory relationships, GRNs were predicted for specific embryonic developmental stages. The targets that are strongly positively correlated with their regulators are mostly expressed at the beginning of seed development. Potential direct targets were identified based on a match between the promoter regions of these inferred targets and the  elements recognized by specific regulators. Our analysis also provides evidence for previously unknown inhibitory effects of three positive regulators of gene expression. The Beacon GRN inference tool provides a valuable model system for context-specific GRN inference and is freely available at https://github.com/BeaconProjectAtVirginiaTech/beacon_network_inference.git.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in genomic technologies have generated large-scale protein-DNA interaction data and open chromatic regions for multiple plant species. To predict condition specific gene regulatory networks using these data, we developed the Condition Specific Regulatory network inference engine (ConSReg), which combines heterogeneous genomic data using sparse linear model followed by feature selection and stability selection to select key regulatory genes. Using Arabidopsis as a model system, we constructed maps of gene regulation under more than 50 experimental conditions including abiotic stresses, cell type-specific expression, and stress responses in individual cell types. Our results show that ConSReg accurately predicted gene expressions (average auROC of 0.84) across multiple testing datasets. We found that, (1) including open chromatin information from ATAC-seq data significantly improves the performance of ConSReg across all tested datasets; (2) choice of negative training samples and length of promoter regions are two key factors that affect model performance. We applied ConSReg to Arabidopsis single cell RNA-seq data of two root cell types (endodermis and cortex) and identified five regulators in two root cell types. Four out of the five regulators have additional experimental evidence to support their roles in regulating gene expression in Arabidopsis roots. By comparing regulatory maps in abiotic stress responses and cell type-specific experiments, we revealed that transcription factors that regulate tissue levels abiotic stresses tend to also regulate stress responses in individual cell types in plants.",

        "abstract": "Established diffractive optical elements (DOEs), such as Dammann gratings, whose phase profile is controlled by etching different depths into a transparent dielectric substrate, suffer from a contradiction between the complexity of fabrication procedures and the performance of such gratings. In this Letter, we combine the concept of geometric phase and phase modulation in depth, and prove by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation that nanorod arrays etched on a silicon substrate have a characteristic of strong polarization conversion between two circularly polarized states and can act as a highly efficient half-wave plate. More importantly, only by changing the orientation angles of each nanorod can the arrays control the phase of a circularly polarized light, cell by cell. With the above principle, we report the realization of nanorod-based Dammann gratings reaching diffraction efficiencies of 50%-52% in the C-band fiber telecommunications window (1530-1565 nm). In this design, uniform 4\u00d74 spot arrays with an extending angle of 59\u00b0\u00d759\u00b0 can be obtained in the far field. Because of these advantages of the single-step fabrication procedure, accurate phase controlling, and strong polarization conversion, nanorod-based Dammann gratings could be utilized for various practical applications in a range of fields.

Recent progress in metasurface research has provided a new solution to achieve innovative compact optical systems. In this Letter, we propose a highly integrated step-zoom lens with dual field of view (FOV) based on double-sided metasurfaces. With silicon nanobrick arrays of spatially varying orientations sitting on both sides of a transparent substrate, this ultrathin step-zoom metalens can be designed to focus an incident circular polarized beam with handedness-dependent FOVs without varying the focal plane, which is important for practical applications. The proposed dual FOV step-zoom metalens, with advantages such as ultracompactness, flexibility, and replicability, can find applications in fields that require ultracompact zoom imaging and beam focusing.",

Results indicate that an appropriate negative angle can compress the signal dynamic range. This technique has been successfully proved by comparison with real measurements.",

In stark contrast to the CpG island hypermethylation phenotype in cancer, we observed a recurrent hypomethylation of 1,006 lncRNA genes in cancer, including EPIC1 (epigenetically-induced lncRNA1). Overexpression of EPIC1 is associated with poor prognosis in luminal B breast cancer patients and enhances tumor growth in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Mechanistically, EPIC1 promotes cell-cycle progression by interacting with MYC through EPIC1's 129-283 nt region. EPIC1 knockdown reduces the occupancy of MYC to its target genes (e.g., CDKN1A, CCNA2, CDC20, and CDC45). MYC depletion abolishes EPIC1's regulation of MYC target and luminal breast cancer tumorigenesis in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.",

Here we report a lncRNA pharmacogenomic landscape by integrating multi-dimensional genomic data of 1005 cancer cell lines and drug response data of 265 anti-cancer compounds. Using Elastic Net (EN) regression, our analysis identifies 27,341 lncRNA-drug predictive pairs. We validate the robustness of the lncRNA EN-models using two independent cancer pharmacogenomic datasets. By applying lncRNA EN-models of 49 FDA approved drugs to the 5605 tumor samples from 21 cancer types, we show that cancer cell line based lncRNA EN-models can predict therapeutic outcome in cancer patients. Further lncRNA-pathway co-expression analysis suggests lncRNAs may regulate drug response through drug-metabolism or drug-target pathways. Finally, we experimentally validate that EPIC1, the top predictive lncRNA for the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal motif (BET) inhibitors, strongly promotes iBET762 and JQ-1 resistance through activating MYC transcriptional activity.",

The goal of this study is to develop an improved therapy that co-delivers a novel bioengineered miRNA prodrug (tRNA-mir-34a) and doxorubicin (DOX) via a multifunctional nanomicellar carrier that is based on a conjugate of amphiphilic copolymer POEG-VBC backbone with creatine, a naturally occurring cationic molecule. Co-delivery of DOX leads to more effective processing of tRNA-mir-34a into mature miR-34a and down-regulation of target genes. DOX\u00a0+\u00a0tRNA-mir-34a/POEG-PCre exhibits potent synergistic anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activity in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the enhanced immune response contributes to the overall antitumor efficacy. POEG-PCre may represent a safe and effective delivery system for an optimal chemo-gene combination therapy.",

It is shown that if the measurement matrix \u03a6 satisfies the RIP condition      \u03b4    2  k      \u03b4  (  p  )   , where    \u03b4  (  p  )    will be specified in the context, then all  k -sparse signals  x  can be recovered stably via the constrained      l    p      minimization based on    b  =  \u03a6  x  +  z   , where  z  is one type of noise. Furthermore, we show that for any    \u03f5  u003e  0   ,      \u03b4    2  k      \u03b4  (  p  )  +  \u03f5    is not sufficient to guarantee the exact recovery of all  k -sparse signals. We also apply the results to the cases of low rank matrix recovery and the reconstruction of sparse vectors in terms of redundant dictionary. In particular, when    p  =  1   , the corresponding constant    \u03b4  (  1  )  =      2      2     , this sharp bound was shown by T. Cai and A. Zhang in their work.

Because of its relatively high phase transition temperature of 68 \u00b0C, the central challenge for VO2-based electronics, lies in finding an energy efficient way, to modulate the phase transition in a reversible and reproducible manner. In this work, we report an experimental realization of p-n heterojunctions by growing VO2 film on p-type GaN substrate. By adding the bias voltage on the p-n junction, the metal-insulator transition behavior of VO2 film can be changed continuously. It is demonstrated that the phase transition of VO2 film is closely associated with the carrier distribution within the space charge region, which can be directly controlled by the bias voltage. Our findings offer novel opportunities for modulating the phase transition of VO2 film in a reversible way as well as extending the concept of electric-field modulation on other phase transition materials.",

However, the traditional approach strategies to enhance the performance of dielectric capacitors cannot simultaneously achieve large capacitance and high breakdown voltage. We demonstrate that such limitations can be overcome by using a completely new three-dimensional (3D) nanoarchitectural electrode design. First, we fabricate a unique nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane with two sets of interdigitated and isolated straight nanopores opening toward opposite planar surfaces. By depositing carbon nanotubes in both sets of pores inside the AAO membrane, the new dielectric capacitor with 3D nanoscale interdigital electrodes is simply realized. In our new capacitors, the large specific surface area of AAO can provide large capacitance, whereas uniform pore walls and hemispheric barrier layers can enhance breakdown voltage. As a result, a high energy density of 2 Wh/kg, which is close to the value of a supercapacitor, can be achieved, showing promising potential in high-density electrical energy storage for various applications.",

        "abstract": "Metal-nanoparticle-catalyzed cutting is a promising way to produce graphene nanostructures with smooth and well-aligned edges. Using a multiscale simulation approach, we unambiguously identified a \"Pac-Man\" cutting mechanism, characterized by the metal nanoparticle \"biting off\" edge carbon atoms through a synergetic effect of multiple metal atoms. By comparing the reaction rates at different types of edge sites, we found that etching of an entire edge carbon row could be triggered by a single zigzag-site etching event, which explains the puzzling linear dependence of the overall carbon-atom etching rate on the nanoparticle surface area observed experimentally. With incorporation of the nanoparticle size effect, the mechanisms revealed herein open a new avenue to improve controllability in graphene cutting.",

        "abstract": "Unravelling the intrinsic mechanism of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by use of heterogeneous catalysts is highly desirable to develop related energy conversion technologies. Albeit dynamic self-reconstruction of the catalysts during OER is extensively observed, it is still highly challenging to operando probe the reconstruction and precisely identify the true catalytically active components. Here, a new class of OER precatalyst, cobalt oxychloride (Co (OH) Cl) with unique features that allow a gradual phase reconstruction during OER due to the etching of lattice anion is demonstrated. The reconstruction continuously boosts OER activities. The reconstruction-derived component delivers remarkable performance in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. Operando synchrotron radiation-based X-ray spectroscopic characterization together with density functional theory calculations discloses that the etching of lattice Cl serves as the key to trigger the reconstruction and the boosted catalytic performance roots in the atomic-level coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS). This work establishes fundamental understanding on the OER mechanism associated with self-reconstruction of heterogeneous catalysts.",

Single-atom electrocatalysts with maximum atom efficiency are highly considered as an alternative of the present noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. However, the fabrication of transition metal single-atoms is very challenging, requiring extensive attempts of precursors with novel design principles. Herein, an all-covalently constructed cobalt-coordinated framework porphyrin with graphene hybridization is innovatively designed and prepared as the pyrolysis precursor to fabricate single-atom Co-N -C electrocatalysts. Excellent electrochemical performances are realized for both bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn-air batteries with regard to reduced overpotentials, improved kinetics, and prolonged cycling stability comparable with noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. Design principles from multiple scales are proposed and rationalized with detailed mechanism investigation. This work not only provides a novel precursor for the fabrication of high-performance single-atom electrocatalysts, but also inspires further attempts to develop advanced materials and emerging applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract    Trans -2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (DHHA) is an important intermediate to synthesize a wide variety of secondary metabolites with potential biological activities. Recently, we engineered a biosynthetic pathway in  Pseudomonas chlororaphis  GP72 and optimized the batch- fermentation conditions to synthesize DHHA. Herein, we developed a proficient method for the separation and purification of DHHA from the culture extract of recombinant  Pseudomonas chlororaphis  GP72 by applying macroporous cation-exchange resins. The performance and absorption characteristics of six resins namely D001, HZD-2, JK006, HD-8, HZ016, and 732 were evaluated. Notably, HD-8 resin displayed the pronounced adsorption and desorption capacities for DHHA as compared to others and its equilibrium adsorption data were well-fitted to the Langmuir isotherm. Moreover, HD-8 column chromatography-based dynamic adsorption and desorption tests were carried out to standardize the operational parameters for DHHA separation and purification. Under the optimized separating conditions, the average adsorption capacity and desorption ratio of DHHA was 40.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7\u202fmg/g dry resin and 86.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8%, respectively. The purity and recovery of DHHA was recorded to be 95.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2% and 83.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.3%, respectively. Taken together, the HD-8 resin appeared as a promising adsorbent for high-level separation and purification of DHHA from the complex media. In conclusion, this method displays a high potential for separating and purifying DHHA and other bioactive compounds in high yield from the fermentation broth.",

        "abstract": "Cinnabarinic acid is a valuable phenoxazinone that has broad applications in the pharmaceutical, chemical and dyeing industries. However, few studies have investigated the production of cinnabarinic acid or its derivatives using genetically engineered microorganisms. Herein, an efficient synthetic pathway of cinnabarinic acid was designed and constructed in Pseudomonas chlororaphis GP72 for the first time, which was more straightforward and robust than the known eukaryotic biosynthetic pathways. First, we screened and identified trans-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (DHHA) dehydrogenases from Escherichia coli MG1655 (encoded by entA), Streptomyces sp. NRRL12068 (encoded by bomO) and Streptomyces chartreusis NRRL3882 (encoded by calB ) based on the structural similarity of the substrate and product, and the DHHA dehydrogenase encoded by calB was selected for the synthesis of cinnabarinic acid due to its high DHHA conversion rate. Subsequently, cinnabarinic acid was synthesized by the expression of the DHHA dehydrogenase CalB and the phenoxazinone synthase CotA in the DHHA-producing strain P. chlororaphis GP72, resulting in a cinnabarinic acid titer of 20.3 mg/L at 48 hour. Further fermentation optimization by the addition of Cu , H O and with adding glycerol increased cinnabarinic acid titer to 136.2 mg/L in shake flasks. The results indicate that P. chlororaphis GP72 may be engineered as a microbial cell factory to produce cinnabarinic acid or its derivatives from renewable bioresources.

However, the motion compensation and large data amount are the inevitable problems to be solved. In this paper, a novel motion compensating method for MIMO-SAR imaging with the under-sampled echo signal is put forward. First, the echo signal model of MIMO-SAR system with motion error is analyzed and a compensating method with the Nyquist-sampled echo data is proposed. Using the technique of two-step compensation, the motion error is compensated and the imaging result is obtained. Second, to compensate the motion error with the under-sampled echo signal, based on the above compensating method, the transform operator and the CS-based imaging scheme are constructed, which could implement the first-step compensation, range compression, and range cell migration correction simultaneously. At last, the imaging result is obtained by the second-step compensation and azimuth compression. Using the proposed method, just a small amount of imaging data is required for MIMO-SAR imaging. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by the imaging simulations.",

However, intrinsic mechanisms that reactivate Drosophila larval neural stem cells (NSCs) to exit from quiescence are not well established. Here we show that the spindle matrix complex containing Chromator (Chro) functions as a key intrinsic regulator of NSC reactivation downstream of extrinsic insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling. Chro also prevents NSCs from re-entering quiescence at later stages. NSC-specific in vivo profiling has identified many downstream targets of Chro, including a temporal transcription factor Grainy head (Grh) and a neural stem cell quiescence-inducing factor Prospero (Pros). We show that spindle matrix proteins promote the expression of Grh and repress that of Pros in NSCs to govern their reactivation. Our data demonstrate that nuclear Chro critically regulates gene expression in NSCs at the transition from quiescence to proliferation.",

This approach contains a number of design stages in which 2\u20133 resonance frequencies of individual resonators or adjacent couplings are extracted from the simulated reflected group delay response of a one-port network separated from the entire filter. The space mapping technique is used to estimate geometric parameters from the extracted elements. Lagrange interpolation is exploited during the design process to estimate a few design parameters using mapping information from previous stages. A Matlab program is created to automate the design of a 6-pole interdigital microstrip band pass filter.",

The surrogate modelling and parameter extraction processes for postfabricated filters are discussed. The tuning algorithm is presented in detail. To validate the proposed method, it is applied to a metallic air filled X-band iris waveguide filter fabricated using selective laser sintering (SLS) technology. The target filter is fabricated in an irregular process in which it is split into three sections with extra flanges for connection after fabrication. This process significantly reduces the time and cost to fabricate a 5 inch long filter using 3D printing. But it also results in extra alignment tolerances and deteriorated return loss. By applying the tuning algorithm, we are able to significantly improve the return loss in just one iteration.",

The detection method consists of two stages: preprocessing and root lesion detection. During preprocessing, a level set segmentation is applied to separate the teeth from the background. Tailored for the dental clinical environment, a segmentation clinical acceleration scheme is applied by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and individual principal component analysis (PCA) to provide an initial contour. Then, based on the segmentation result, root lesion detection is performed. Firstly, the teeth are isolated by the average intensity profile. Secondly, a center-line zero crossing based candidate generation is applied to generate the possible root lesion areas. Thirdly, the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelets Transform (DT-CWT) is used to further remove false positives. Lastly when the root lesion is detected, the area of root lesion is automatically marked with color indication representing different levels of seriousness. 150 real dental X-rays with various degrees of root lesions are used to test the proposed method. The results were validated by the dentist. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to successfully detect the root lesion and provide visual assistance to the dentist.",

These reports show that metallic nanoparticles etch the surface layers of graphite or graphene anisotropically along the crystallographic zig-zag \u203911-20\u203a or armchair \u203910-10\u203a directions. The etching direction can be influenced by external magnetic fields or the supporting substrate. Here we report the subsurface etching of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite by Ni nanoparticles, to form a network of tunnels, as seen by scanning electron microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy. In this new nanoporous form of graphite, the top layers bend inward on top of the tunnels, whereas their local density of states remains fundamentally unchanged. Engineered nanoporous tunnel networks in graphite allow for further chemical modification and may find applications in various fields and in fundamental science research.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is responsible for recognizing viral single-stranded RNA and antiviral imidazoquinoline compounds, leading to the activation of the innate immune response. In this study, mutated pigeon TLR7 fragments, in which the insertion at position 10 of leucine-rich repeat 10 (LRR10) or at position 15 of LRR2/11/13/14 was deleted, were amplified with an overlap-PCR method, and inserted into the expression vector pCMV. The immune functions of the TLR7 mutants were determined with an NF-\u03baB luciferase assay of transfected cells. The deletion of the insertions absolutely abolished TLR7-NF-\u03baB signaling. With quantitative real-time PCR and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we observed that stimulation with R848 failed to induce the expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) in any of the mutant-TLR7-transfected cells, consistent with their lack of NF-\u03baB activity. However, the expression of interferon \u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) was significantly upregulated in the Del10IN10 and Del14IN15 groups. Remarkably, the levels of pigeon TLR7 expression were significantly increased in all the TLR7-mutated groups. Therefore, we speculate that another part of the deficient TLR7 mediates the induction of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 by increasing the expression of TLR7 as compensation. However, the increased expression of TLR7 in the Del11IN15 group failed to induce the production of IFN-\u03b1, IL-8, or TNF-\u03b1, indicating that a false compensation occurred when the crucial LRR insertion was deleted.",

        "abstract": "In 2009, a novel pandemic swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus caused a public emergency of international concern. Vaccination is the primary strategy for the control of influenza epidemics. However, the poor immunopotency of many vaccine antigens is a major barrier to the development of effective vaccines against influenza. Flagellin, a Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) ligand, has been used as an adjuvant to enhance the immunopotency of vaccines in preclinical studies. Here, we developed a recombinant candidate vaccine, HA1-2-fljB, in which the globular head of the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen (residues 62-284) from H1N1 virus was fused genetically to the N-terminus of Salmonella typhimurium \ufb02jB. The recombinant HA1-2-fljB protein was expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli, and the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant HA1-2-fljB were evaluated in a mouse model. Immunization with HA1-2-fljB elicited robust IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies and completely protected the mice against infection by swine-origin influenza A/swine/Jangsu/38/2010 (H1N1). These results suggest that HA antigen placed at the N-terminus of flagellin is also an excellent starting point for creating a fusion HA1-2-fljB protein as a candidate vaccine, and the recombinant HA1-2-fljB protein will contribute to the development of a more effective vaccine against swine-origin influenza virus infection.",

        "abstract": "Sudden increases in the number of human A (H7N9) cases reported during December and January have been observed in previous years. Most reported infection cases are due to prior exposure to live poultry or potentially contaminated environments. Low pathogenicity of influenza A (H7N9) virus in avian species complicates timely discovery of infected birds. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop safe and effective anti-H7N9 vaccines for poultry to reduce the risk of human infection and prevent the emergence of novel mutated strains. In addition to a good antigen, an effective vaccine also requires an appropriate adjuvant to enhance its immunogenicity. Previously, we generated an H7N9 influenza recombinant subunit vaccine (HA1-2-fliC), in which haemagglutinin globular head domain (HA1-2) was fused with flagellin (fliC), a potent TLR5 ligand, and demonstrated that HA1-2-fliC elicited effective HA1-2-specific immune responses in mice.In this study, we determined flagellin-induced expression profiles of cytokines and chemokines in different types of avian immune cells in vitro and ex vivo. We found that flagellin significantly increased the expression levels of CXCL inflammatory chemokines (CXCLi1 and CXCLi2) and CCL chemokines (MIP-1\u03b2 and MCP-3) in avian macrophage HD11 cells. In addition, HA1-2-fliC induced significant upregulation of cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18 and IFN-\u03b3) and chemokines (CXCLi1, CXCLi2 and MIP-1\u03b2) in ex vivo splenic lymphocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), suggesting that flagellin promoted immune responses of avian cells in vitro. We also evaluated specific humoural and cellular immune responses induced by HA1-2-fliC and found that chickens immunised intramuscularly with HA1-2-fliC showed significantly higher HA1-2-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G titers in serum. Furthermore, HA1-2-fliC potentiated cellular immune responses, as reflected by an increase in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and proliferation of PBMCs. Significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 in PBMCs from chickens vaccinated with HA1-2-fliC further indicated that HA1-2-fliC promoted a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response.We demonstrated that the use of the flagellin as an adjuvant potentiated immunogenicity of influenza subunit vaccine HA1-2 in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide a basis for the development of H7N9 influenza HA1-2 subunit vaccines for chickens.",

Two extrapolating schemes enable us to remove the basis set truncation error and to estimate the complete basis set limit. Corrections of core-valence correlation and relativistic effect are included in our calculations. By solving the radial Schrodinger equation of nuclear motion, the vibrational energy levels as well as rotational and centrifugal distortion constants of the ground electronic states for the three species are obtained. Ionization potentials and the electron affinities are also obtained on the RCCSD(T)/AV6Z level. The knowledge extracted from this work are anticipated to extend our understanding on molecular characteristics of the ClO  n   ( n \u00a0=\u00a0\u22121, 0, +1) systems and can serve as guidelines for further experimental or theoretical researches.",

        "abstract": "Structure-based design and discovery of novel neuroimmunophilin FK506-binding protein (FKBP) ligands were pursued in the present study. The binding mode of the known FKBP ligand 1 (3-(3-pyridyl)-1-propyl (2S)-1-(3,3-dimethyl-1,2-dioxopentyl)-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylate) in complex with FKBP12 was investigated using LUDI simulation and upon which a novel scaffold structure predicted to possess improved binding affinity was designed. A virtual combinatorial library composed of diverse combinations of two substituted groups was constructed using Project Library, followed by an automated screening of the library against the ligand binding site on FKBP52 using DOCK. Forty-three candidate compounds that displayed favorable binding with the receptor were identified and synthesized. The neurotrophic activity of the candidate compounds was evaluated on chick dorsal root ganglion cultures in vitro. As a result, 15 compounds exhibited positive effects on ganglion neurite outgrowth in the presence of 0.15 ng/mL NGF, among which 7 compounds at testing concentrations of 1 pM and 100 pM showed greater efficacy than 1 at 100 pM. Compound 18 (3-(3-pyridyl)-1-propyl (2S)-5,5-dimethyl-1-(3,3-dimethyl-1,2-dioxobutyl)-2-(4-thiazolidine)carboxylate) afforded the most potent effect in promoting the processes of neurite outgrowth and which was in a concentration-dependent manner from 1 pM to 100 pM. Half-maximal effect occurred at about 10 pM. Moreover, 18 at a dosage of 10 mg/kg was found to be significantly neuroprotective in a mouse peripheral sympathetic nerve injury model induced by 8 mg/kg 6-hydroxydopamine. This study further suggests the clinical potential of novel FKBP ligands as a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.",

        "abstract": "Cancer cells have an increased requirement for iron than normal cells, and iron chelators are under active consideration for cancer treatment. The metal-sequestering potential and antiproliferative mechanisms of a novel hydroxyphenyl hydrazone derivate YCL0426 were investigated here. Antiproliferative activity of YCL0426 was detected by MTT assay. The iron-sequestering potential was evaluated by ferrozine-Fe(II) sequestering assay and Fe(II) titration assay. Cell-cycle-arresting profile was checked by flow cytometry and the DNA synthesis status was evaluated by BrdU incorporation assay. SW480 cells stably expressing Rad51-EGFP fusion protein were used to evaluate the DNA damaging potential of the compound. The impact of extra Fe(II) supplement on compound activities was also examined. YCL0426 shows significant antiproliferative activity on 15 cancer cell lines with mean IC50 values of 5.25\u2009\u03bcmol/l. YCL0426 displayed concentration-dependent Fe(II) sequestering ability in ferrozine-Fe(II) sequestering assay, and induced upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and divalent metal transporter 1 expression in HepG2 cells, which are genes responsible for Fe(II) uptake. YCL0426 blocked DNA synthesis in BrdU incorporation assay, and arrested cell cycle at S or G1 phase. Besides, YCL0426 induced Rad51 foci formation and histone H2AX phosphorylation with EC50 values of 1.35 and 2.29\u2009\u03bcmol/l, respectively, indicating the emergence of DNA damage. All these cellular responses, and even the growth-inhibiting activity of YCL0426, can be readily reversed by Fe(II) repletion, indicating that iron sequestering is responsible, at least in part, for the antiproliferative activity of YCL0426. YCL0426 is a potent iron chelator that exerts significant antiproliferative activities by inducing G1/S arrest and DNA damage.",

        "abstract": "Due to the limitations of existing anti-EV71 targets, we have been eager to discover a new anti-EV71 agent based on mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), which is an important target for finding antiviral agents based on host cells. Torin2 is a second-generation ATP competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor (IC\u202f=\u202f0.25\u202fnM). Our research team tested the anti-EV71 activity of Torin2 in\u00a0vitro for the first time. The result showed that Torin2 had significant anti-EV71 activity (IC\u202f=\u202f0.01\u202f\u03bcM). In this study, thirty novel Torin2 derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for anti-EV71 activity. Among them, 11a, 11b, 11d, 11e and 11m displayed similar activity to Torin2. 11e displayed the most potent activity, with an IC value of 0.027\u202f\u03bcM, which was closest to Torin2, and displayed potent mTOR kinase inhibitory activity. A molecular modeling study showed that 11e interacted with Val2240 and Lys2187 via hydrogen bonds and had a good match with the receptor. Additionally, a mechanism study showed that most of the compounds had significant inhibition for the mTOR pathway substrates p70S6K and Akt. The water solubility test of compounds with potent activity revealed that 11a and 11m were improved by approximately 5-15-fold compared to Torin2. These data suggest that 11a and 11m may be potential candidates for anti-EV71 treatment.",

        "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), designed to selectively deliver cytotoxic agents to antigen-bearing cells, are poised to become an important class of cancer therapeutics. Human epithelial growth factor receptor (HER2) is considered an effective target for cancer treatment, and a HER2-targeting ADC has shown promising results. Most ADCs undergoing clinical evaluation contain linkers that have a lysosomal protease-cleavable dipeptide, of which the most common is valine-citrulline (VC). However, valine-alanine (VA), another dipeptide comprising two human essential amino acids, has been used in next generation ADCs loading new toxins, but the druggable properties of ADCs loaded the most popular monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) remain to be further explored. In this study, we generated VA-based ADCs that connected MMAE to an anti-HER2 antibody. We studied the differences in the preparation process, in vitro stability, cathepsin B activity and in vitro cytotoxicity of VA-based ADC compared to the ADC of VC. VA had comparable performance to VC, which preliminarily displays its practicability. Additional efficacy and safety studies in a xenograft model indicate this novel ADC exerted potent anti-tumor activity and negligible toxicity. The results of this study show the application potential of VA-based ADC with MMAE as the payload.",

Unexpectedly, the inhibition of Beclin 1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have no obvious effect on Z18-induced autophagy in HeLa cells, implying that it is a non-canonical Beclin 1-independent autophagy.

        "abstract": "Cathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine protease involved in many diseases. The present research demonstrates that derivatives of epoxysuccinyl-peptide are effective and selective cathepsin B inhibitors. We synthesized a series of epoxysuccinyl-peptide derivatives based on the well-known cathepsin B inhibitor E64d. Specifically, we substituted the 2-methylpropane group at the R position of E64d with a sulfane, such as ethyl(methyl) sulfane or benzyl(methyl) sulfane. We also designed and synthesized a library of molecules with various substituents at the R position of E64d to replace 2-methylbutane. By studying the structure-activity relationships of these newly synthesized molecules as cathepsin B inhibitors, we demonstrated that substituting ethyl(methyl) sulfane for 2-methylbutane (R) of E64d improves the inhibitory activity and selectivity for cathepsin B inhibition. Our new cathepsin B inhibitors were highly effective and selective.",

Interleukin-33 (IL-33) plays a crucial role in the inflammatory and apoptotic pathways through binding of the transmembrane ST2 receptor. This study investigated the expression and cellular localization of IL-33 in the cerebral cortex after SAH in order to clarify the role of IL-33 after SAH. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham and SAH groups and evaluated 2, 6, and 12\u00a0h and 1, 2, 3, and 5\u00a0days after the surgery, with SAH animals subjected to prechiasmatic cistern SAH. IL-33 expression was measured by western blot analysis, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also assessed. The expression of IL-33, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 was markedly elevated in the SAH as compared to the sham group; IL-33 was mainly localized in neurons and astrocytes and not microglia after SAH. Moreover, a significant positive association was observed between IL-33 and IL-1\u03b2 expression. These findings indicate that IL-33 might play an important role in the inflammatory response following SAH.",

Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific proteases 3 (SENP3), a member of the SUMO-specific protease family, was identified as an isopeptidase that deconjugates SUMOylation (The covalent modification by SUMO) of modified protein substrates. It is reported that SUMO-2/3 conjugation, a member of SUMOylation, presented neuroprotection. The study aimed to evaluate the expression of SENP3 and to explore its role potential role in SAH. A total of 95 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham group and SAH groups at 6, 12, 24, 48\u00a0h, day 3, day 5, and day 7. SAH groups suffered experimental SAH by injection with 0.3\u00a0ml nonheparinized autoblood into the prechiasmatic cistern. SENP3 expression is surveyed by western blot analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. The levels of cleavage caspase-3 were determined by western blot and immunohistochemistry. SENP3 protein expression was significantly up-regulated after SAH which peaked at 24\u00a0h; however, the mRNA expression of SENP3 remained unchanged. Meanwhile, the level of cleaved caspase-3 was also increased after SAH. There is a highly positive correlation between cleavage caspase-3 and SENP3 in protein level. Immunofluorescent results showed that the expression of SENP3 was increased in neurons, rather than astrocytes nor microglia. Our findings indicated a possible role of SENP3 in the pathogenesis of early brain injury mediated by apoptosis following SAH.",

Accumulated evidence has clearly demonstrated that Ngb has a neuro-protective role enhancing cell viability under hypoxia and other types of oxidative stress. It was suggested that oxidant stress could play an important role in neuronal injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The present study aims to examine the expression of Ngb in the temporal cortex and its cellular localization after SAH. We used a prechiasmatic cistern model of SAH. Ngb expression was examined at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after SAH by western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to detect the localization of Ngb. Real-time PCR demonstrated that Ngb mRNA levels increased from 3 h after SAH, peaked at 6 h. Western blot showed Ngb protein levels were significantly increased in SAH groups in the temporal cortex and reached the peak at 24 h after SAH. The immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that Ngb was weakly expressed in the cortex in the control group while the enhanced expression of Ngb could be detected in the SAH groups. In addition, immunofluorescence results revealed that the over-expressed Ngb was located in the neuronal and microglia cell cytoplasm. These findings indicated that Ngb might play an important neuro-protective effect after SAH.",

        "title": "Growth inhibitory in vitro effects of glycyrrhizic acid in U251 glioblastoma cell line.",
        "abstract": "Despite dramatic advances in cancer therapy, the overall prognosis of glioblastoma (GBM) remains dismal. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) has been previously demonstrated to be constitutively activated in glioblastoma, and it was suggested as a potential therapeutic target. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) has been proved to have cytotoxic effects in many cancer cell lines. However, its role in glioblastoma has not yet been addressed. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of GA on human glioblastoma U251 cell line. The effects of GA on proliferation of U251 cells were measured by CCK-8 assay and plate colony-forming test. Cellular apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 fluorescent staining and flow cytometry with annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining. The expression of nuclear p65 protein, the active subunit of NF-\u03baB, was determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Our results demonstrated that the survival rate and colony formation of U251 cells significantly decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner after GA addition, and the apoptotic ratio of GA-treated groups was significantly higher than that of control groups. Furthermore, the expression of NF-\u03baB-p65 in the nucleus was remarkably reduced after GA treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that GA treatment can confer inhibitory effects on human glioblastoma U251 cell line including inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis, which is possibly related to the NF-\u03baB mediated pathway.",

        "abstract": "Translocation of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from nucleus could trigger inflammation. Extracellular HMGB1 up-regulates inflammatory response in sepsis as a late mediator. However, little was known about its role in subarachnoid hemorrhage-inducible inflammation, especially in the early stage. This study aims to identify whether HMGB1 translocation occurred early after SAH and also to clarify the potential role of HMGB1 in brain injury following SAH.Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into sham group and SAH groups at 2 h, 12 h and on day 1, day 2. SAH groups suffered experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage by injection of 0.3 ml autoblood into the pre-chiasmatic cistern. Rats injected by recombinant HMGB1(rHMGB1) solution were divided into four groups according to different time points. Cultured neurons were assigned into control group and four hemoglobin (Hb) incubated groups. Mixed glial cells were cultured and stimulated in medium from neurons incubated by Hb. HMGB1 expression is measured by western blot analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Downstream nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) subunit P65 and inflammatory factor Interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) were measured by western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. Brain injury was evaluated by cleaved caspase-3 staining.Our results demonstrated HMGB1 translocation occurred as early as 2 h after experimental SAH with mRNA and protein level increased. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence results indicated cytosolic HMGB1 was mainly located in neurons while translocated HMGB1 could also be found in some microglia. After subarachnoid injection of rHMGB1, NF-\u03baB, downstream inflammatory response and cleaved caspase-3 were up-regulated in the cortex compared to the saline control group. In-vitro, after Hb incubation, HMGB1 was also rapidly released from neurons to medium. Incubation with medium from neurons up-regulated IL-1\u03b2 in mixed glial cells. This effect could be inhibited by HMGB1 specific inhibitor glycyrrhizic acid (GA) treatment.HMGB1 was released from neurons early after SAH onset and might trigger inflammation as an upstream inflammatory mediator. Extracellular HMGB1 contributed to the brain injury after SAH. These results might have important implications during the administration of specific HMGB1 antagonists early in order to prevent or reduce inflammatory response following SAH.",

        "abstract": "Background Necroptosis is an emerging programmed necrosis other than traditional necrosis and apoptosis. Until recently, there have not been studies that have investigated a relationship between necroptosis and pathogenesis of cell death after spinal cord injury (SCI). Objective To investigate whether necroptosis takes part in the early pathophysiological processes of traumatic SCI in mice. Methods Female ICR mice were randomized equally into three groups: the sham, the vehicle-treated + SCI group, and the Nec-1-treated + SCI group. To induce SCI, the mice were subjected to a laminectomy at T9 and compression with a vascular clip. After mice were sacrificed 24 hours post-SCI, propidium iodide (PI)-positive cells were detected using in vivo PI labeling. Morphological analyses were performed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining. The samples were evaluated for apoptosis by the in situ TUNEL assay. The expression of caspase-3 was assessed by western blot. Locomotor behavior of hindlimb was evaluated by BMS (Basso mouse scale) score at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days post-injury. Results Compared with dimethyl sulfoxide -treated mice, necrostatin-1-treated mice showed decreased PI-positive cells (P < 0.05), alleviated tissue damage, more surviving neuron at 24 hours after SCI (P < 0.05), and improved functional recovery from days 7 to 14 (P < 0.05). Necrostatin-1 did not reduce the expression of caspase-3 and the number of TUNEL-positive cells at 24 hours after SCI (P > 0.05). Conclusions Necroptosis contributes to necroptotic cell death and influences functional outcome after SCI in adult mice. The inhibition of necroptosis by necrostatin-1 may have therapeutic potential for patients with SCI.",

A vehicle-load model is constructed and a heuristic algorithm for the model is designed. The vehicle routing that customers are not served by basic vehicle is re-optimized using SWEEP rules. Then these customers are severed by SWEEP vehicles in order that the total serve time will be more less and the cost is decreased. 24 vehicle routing problems at different scales are researched by simulation with the proposed heuristic algorithm. The simulation results show that the vehicle-load model and its heuristic algorithm are adaptive for the VRP, and the improved coordination strategy based on the SWEEP can solve the VRP efficiently.",

Here we investigated how matrix stiffness modulates stem cell differentiation in a model of vascular graft transplantation. Multipotent neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells, embedded in the hydrogel on the outer surface of nanofibrous polymer grafts, and implanted into rat carotid arteries by anastomosis. After 3 months, NCSCs differentiated into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) near the outer surface of the polymer grafts; in contrast, NCSCs differentiated into glial cells in the most part of the hydrogel. Atomic force microscopy demonstrated a stiffer matrix near the polymer surface but much lower stiffness away from the polymer graft. Consistently, in vitro studies confirmed that stiff surface induced SMC genes whereas soft surface induced glial genes. These results suggest that the scaffold's mechanical properties play an important role in directing stem cell differentiation in vivo, which has important implications in biomaterials design for stem cell delivery and tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Vascular disease, such as neointimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis, involves in migration and proliferation of vascular cells in blood vessel wall. It is generally accepted that the de-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contributes to vascular diseases. However, previous studies suggest that resident multipotent vascular stem cells (MVSCs) are also involved in neointima formation. In this study, we isolated MVSCs from the medial layer of human carotid artery and thoracic aorta by explant cultures, characterized these cells, and identified the origin of these vascular cells populated in lesion areas. Human MVSCs could be isolated from healthy and diseased blood vessels, were cloneable, and were positive for stem cell markers SOX10 and SOX17 but not SMC markers \u03b1-actin and calponin-1. MVSCs were able to differentiate into neural cells, SMCs and other mesenchymal lineages in vitro. In addition, we examined the location of MVSCs in diseased vascular wall by immunohistochemistry. The majority of cells within tunica media were calponin-positive cells, whereas a small population of cells was proliferative and double positive for SOX10 and Ki67 in the border between tunica intima and media. The number of SOX10+ cells in atherosclerotic lesions was more than that in healthy blood vessels, and some of these cells were double positive for SOX10 and chondrogenic markers. Furthermore, we performed in situ PCR and proximity ligation assays to stain for the epigenetic markers of SMC lineage. The results suggested that SOX10+ cells in cell cultures and tissue sections were not derived from de-differentiated SMCs. In conclusion, these findings support that MVSCs contributes to human vascular diseases.",

Understanding the contribution of vascular cells to blood vessel remodeling is critical for the development of new therapeutic approaches to cure cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and regenerate blood vessels. Recent findings suggest that neointimal formation and atherosclerotic lesions involve not only inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, but also several types of stem cells or progenitors in arterial walls and the circulation. Some of these stem cells also participate in the remodeling of vascular grafts, microvessel regeneration, and formation of fibrotic tissue around biomaterial implants. Here we review the recent findings on how adult stem cells participate in CVD development and regeneration as well as the current state of clinical trials in the field, which may lead to new approaches for cardiovascular therapies and tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Objective\u2014  Previous genetic lineage tracing studies showed that Sox10 +  cells differentiate into vascular mural cells, limited to neural crest\u2013derived blood vessels in craniofacial tissues, aortic arch, pulmonary arch arteries, brachiocephalic, carotid arteries, and thymus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of Sox10 +  cells to the vascular development in other tissues and organs and their relationship with neural crest.  Approach and Results\u2014  Using genetic lineage tracing technique based on Cre/LoxP system, we examined blood vessels in the adult organs of the mice expressing Sox10-Cre/Rosa-LoxP-red fluorescent protein or Wnt1-Cre/Rosa-LoxP-red fluorescent protein by immunohistological analysis. In addition to previously reported tissues and organs derived from neural crest, we showed that Sox10 +  cells also contributed to vascular mural cells in the lung, spleen, and kidney, which are derived from non-neural crest origin as evidenced by red fluorescent protein-negative blood vessels in these 3 organs of Wnt1-Cre/Rosa-LoxP-red fluorescent protein mice.  Conclusions\u2014  This study demonstrates that Sox10 +  cells contribute to pericytes and smooth muscle cells in most parts of the body, including those from neural crest and non-neural crest, which has significant implications in vascular remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A retrospective study was performed. The aim of the study was to illustrate the characteristics of pediatric spine tumors (PSTs) and obtain better insight into therapeutic strategies of such kinds of tumors. PSTs, a heterogeneous group of tumors occurred among pediatric group, are relatively uncommon and rarely reported in the literature. A retrospective study was performed to analyze clinical features and prognostic factors of patients with PSTs who were treated in our center between 2000 and 2013. Local relapse-free survival (LRFS) and overall survival (OS) rate were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method to identify potential prognostic factors. Factors with P values of 0.1 or lower were subjected to multivariate analysis by Cox regression analysis. P values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically significant. A total of 190 patients with PSTs were included in the study. The mean follow-up period was 53.5 months. Of the 190 patients, 127 cases (66.8%) were diagnosed as benign lesions or tumor-like lesions, with 19 cases as aggressive lesions and 44 cases as malignant lesions. Recurrence was detected in 30 patients after initial surgery in our center, whereas death occurred in 24 cases. Implant failure and spinal deformity occurred in 3 and 5 patients, respectively. The statistical analysis suggested that multiple segments involvement (n \u2265 3), aggressive and malignant lesion were independent prognostic factors for LRFS, whereas malignant lesion was the only unfavorable factors for OS. In the subgroup analysis, multiple segments involvement (n \u2265 3) and Enneking stages III were independent factors for LRFS of patients with benign or aggressive lesions. Malignant lesion was significantly associated with decreased OS and LRFS of PSTs, whereas multiple segments involvement (n \u2265 3) and aggressive lesions were significantly associated with LRFS. 4.",

        "abstract": "Small-diameter synthetic vascular grafts have high failure rate due to primarily surface thrombogenicity, and effective surface chemical modification is critical to maintain the patency of the grafts. In this study, we engineered a small-diameter, elastic synthetic vascular graft with off-the-shelf availability and anti-thrombogenic activity. Polycarbonate-urethane (PCU), was electrospun to produce nanofibrous grafts that closely mimicked a native blood vessel in terms of structural and mechanical strength. To overcome the difficulty of adding functional groups to PCU, we explored various surface modification methods, and determined that plasma treatment was the most effective method to modify the graft surface with functional amine groups, which were subsequently employed to conjugate heparin via end-point immobilization. In addition, we confirmed in vitro that the combination of plasma treatment and end-point immobilization of heparin exhibited the highest surface density and correspondingly the highest anti-thrombogenic activity of heparin molecules. Furthermore, from an in vivo study using a rat common carotid artery anastomosis model, we showed that plasma-heparin grafts had higher patency rate at 2 weeks and 4 weeks compared to plasma-control (untreated) grafts. More importantly, we observed a more complete endothelialization of the luminal surface with an aligned, well-organized monolayer of endothelial cells, as well as more extensive graft integration in terms of vascularization and cell infiltration from the surrounding tissue. This work demonstrates the feasibility of electrospinning PCU as synthetic elastic material to fabricate nanofibrous vascular grafts, as well as the potential to endow desired functionalization to the graft surface via plasma treatment for the conjugation of heparin or other bioactive molecules. Statement of Significance Vascular occlusion remains the leading cause of death all over the world, despite advances made in balloon angioplasty and conventional surgical intervention. Currently, autografts are the gold-standard grafts used to treat vascular occlusive disease. However, many patients with vascular occlusive disease do not have autologous vascular graft available. Therefore, there is a widely recognized need for a readily available, functional, small-diameter vascular graft (inner diameter of <6 mm). This work addresses this critical need by developing a method of antithrombogenic modification of synthetic grafts.",

        "abstract": "Tissue engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) hold great promise for clinical use in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring vascular access for hemodialysis. A promising way to make TEBVs is to exploit foreign body response (FBR) of polymeric rods used as templates. However, since the FBR predominantly involves bone-marrow (BM) derived cells and ESRD coincides with impaired function of BM, it is important to assess the generation of TEBVs in conditions of renal failure. To this end, we implanted polymer rods in the subcutis of rats after BM-transplantation with GFP-labeled BM cells in a model of chronic kidney disease (CKD). At 3 weeks after implantation, rods were encapsulated by tissue capsule (TC) composed of collagen, myofibroblasts and macrophages. On average, 13% of CD68 macrophages were GFP, indicating BM origin. Macrophage-to-myofibroblasts differentiation appeared to play an important role in TC formation as 26% of SMA/GFP myofibroblasts co-expressed the macrophage marker CD68. Three weeks after rod implantation, the cellular response changed towards tissue repair, characterized by 40% increase in CD68/CD163 repair associated macrophages and 95% increase in TGF\u03b2 and IL10 gene expression as compared to TCs harvested at 1 week. These results show that both BM derived and tissue resident cells, contribute to TC formation, whereas macrophages serve as precursors of myofibroblasts in mature TCs. Finally, the presence of CKD did not significantly alter the process of TC formation, which holds the potential to support our approach for future clinical use in ESRD patients.",

        "abstract": "During the torpedo guidance procedure, homing-torpedo beam allocation and guidance operate in a fixed allocation mode. However, in the complicated acoustic-warfare environment, the true target is very likely to release many decoys. The torpedo must constantly detect and track multiple targets at the same time before the actual target is confirmed. Based on the analysis of the environment, this study suggests an efficacy-computation model on the basis of lobes and a secondary beam-disposal framework based on beam formation and beam allocation, in addition to the universal norm for lobe classification based on the maximum efficacy. Based on considering four factors simultaneously - target probability, tracking demand, identification needs and task requirements - a comprehensive self-adaptive beam-allocation method is proposed. First, the whole beam section is divided into many lobes based on all target positions, and then all the target efficacies in each lobe can be computed. The calculation methods for both the efficacy function of each factor and the overall efficacy function are also provided. The simulation results show that this method can ensure that the stable tracking of multiple targets and the goals is identified simultaneously. This method can provide a rational and effective approach to multiple-target beam allocation.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the performance of the integrated navigation system, a new navigation resource management method based on an efficiency function is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the framework of the navigation resource management method is established. Secondly, the representation of the efficiency function is given, which based on the navigation accuracy, the sensor accuracy and the navigation task. Finally, this method is simulated and compared to the traditional data fusion method. The simulation results show that the positioning accuracy and the computing time of this method are improved by 20.1% and 26.7%, respectively. This method makes full use of the sensor accuracy, and manages the navigation resource effectively. It effectively improves the navigation accuracy and the computational efficiency.",

In this study we show that a novel compound, 3-{4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}- 2-[2-(2-nitro-phenoxy)-acetyl amino]-propionic acid (O325H), is an agonist with dual effect on PPARalpha/gamma by using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. By activating PPARalpha and PPARgamma simultaneously, O325H promotes pre-adipocyte differentiation and up-regulates the expression of glucose and lipid metabolic target genes. In diabetic mice, administration of O325H at 10 mg/kg decreases the blood lipid and glucose levels. Therefore, O325H has dual action on PPARalpha and PPARgamma and is a promising agent for the amelioration of lipid metabolic disorders and diabetes associated with insulin resistance.",

Methods: Sixty-eight patients with history of surgical treatment or chemoradiotherapy and clear pathological diagnosis in the anamnesis of recurrent or metastatic peritoneo-pelvic malignant tumors were randomly divided into two groups. HIFU plus chemotherapy were administrated to the patients in the study group (n=36), and chemotherapy alone in the controls (n=32). All patients received at last two cycles of chemotherapy and were followed up for more than 1 year. Results: The overall response rate and clinical benefit rate (CBR) were 69.4% and 83.3% in the study group, 31.3% (P<0.01) and 56.3% (P<0.05) in the control group. The mean survival time were 9.1\u00b13.1 months and 6.8\u00b12.4 months respectively (P<0.01). The main toxicities included myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reaction (P>0.05). Other side effects, such as the viscera perforation, massive hemorrhage, pancreatic leakage and peritonitis didn't occur in the study group. Conclusion: The results indicate that HIFU with chemotherapy is a feasible and well-tolerated regimen on recurrent or metastatic peritoneo-pelvic malignant tumors.",

Because of the high dimension of character animation motion data and correlation lying in various dimensions, it is a very hard work to analyze and compute directly. The motion data are mapped from high-dimensional space to two-dimensional latent space based on Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVM). Then, the representative poses of virtual characters are found out by clustering the motion data in latent space, which can expand a subspace that contains the primary characters and disciplinarians of training data. Finally, the weight of representative poses is optimized combined with constraints on the end effectors, and the optimized pose is obtained. The experiments show that the proposed method obtains a better effect.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the development and experiments of a 100 kV-level pulse generator based on a metal-oxide varistor (MOV). MOV has a high energy handling capacity and nonlinear voltage-current (V-I) characteristics, which makes it useful for high voltage pulse shaping. Circuit simulations based on the measured voltage-current characteristics of MOV verified the shaping concept and showed that a circuit containing a two-section pulse forming network (PFN) will result in better defined square pulse than a simple L-C discharging circuit. A reduced-scale experiment was carried out and the result agreed well with simulation prediction. Then a 100 kV-level pulse generator with multiple MOVs in a stack and a two-section pulse forming network (PFN) was experimented. A pulse with a voltage amplitude of 90 kV, rise time of about 50 ns, pulse width of 500 ns, and flat top of about 400 ns was obtained with a water dummy load of 50 \u03a9. The results reveal that the combination of PFN and MOV is a practical way to generate high voltage pulses with better flat top waveforms, and the load voltage is stable even if the load's impedance varies. Such pulse generator can be applied in many fields such as surface treatment, corona plasma generation, industrial dedusting, and medical disinfection.",

        "abstract": "Development of pulsed power technology is toward higher power, longer duration, and more compact structures. Compact coaxial propylene carbonate pulse forming lines are widely used in the application of pulsed power systems. In order to further lengthen the duration and decrease the geometrical sizes of pulsed power systems, a comb-type pulse forming line is adopted. It is a slow-wave structure with a comb-type inner electrode. In this paper, the operation principle, theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental investigation of the comb-type forming line are carried out, respectively. First, the operation principle is briefly introduced. The principle to increase the duration is explained. Second, the theoretical analyses about the dispersion relation are proposed. Third, the PSpice model is built by the L-C network. Based on the calculated parameters, the electrical circuit is simulated. A Computer Simulation Technology (CST) model is also built, which allows for a straightforward coupling of electric and magnetic (EM) simulation and circuit simulation. Finally, the comb-type pulse forming line is experimentally tested and verified. For the comb-type propylene carbonate forming line with a 67 cm length to replace the traditional coaxial one, it has an impedance of 8 \u03a9 and a duration of 64 ns. Experimental data on its test results are given. The experimental results are in accordance with the numerical simulations. The investigation approved the comb-type pulse forming line feasible and set a solid foundation for its application in the pulsed power system.",

        "abstract": "Cytosine-rich DNA strands, due to their distinct i-motif structure, are often used as stabilization templates for the formation of silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs). DNA i-motif conformation and stability are largely determined by the DNA loop region. Therefore, the optimal loop sequence contributes to the DNA template, forming a stable i-motif structure, thus promoting the formation of Ag NCs. In the present work, we prepared Ag NCs stabilized by a set of DNA sequences CCCC-X1X2X3X4-CCCC (C denotes cytosine, X denotes adenine or thymine) and investigated the loop sequence dependence of the fluorescence quantum yields (QYs) of Ag NCs. In all of the template DNA, the sequence 5\u2032-CCCC-ATAT-CCCC-3\u2032 was screened to be the most optimal template which stabilized clusters and could emit the brightest red fluorescence with a quantum yield (QY) of 0.78. However, for the reversed template sequence 5\u2032-CCCC-TATA-CCCC-3\u2032, the QY of the Ag NCs is lowered to 0.15. Such a significant difference in QYs indicates that even for the same base sequence, a different base alignment direction (starting from the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end) can have an important effect on the fluorescence of nanoclusters. Additionally, to optimize the preparation conditions of Ag NCs, the effects of reductants and pH environment on the clusters stabilized by the template sequence 5\u2032-CCCC-ATAT-CCCC-3\u2032 were further examined by using CD, UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively.",

Tissue engineering requires a scaffold that encourages cells to grow on it; hydrogels, which are polymeric materials that contain large amounts of water, can form such scaffolds and can be injected, thereby avoiding surgery and easily filling irregularly shaped bone defects. Nongyue He from Southeast University, Nanjing, China and colleagues have reviewed the materials and techniques available to make injectable hydrogels. They conclude that natural materials are biocompatible but lack strength, whereas synthetic materials are strong but not biocompatible. Similarly, physical fabrication is simple but produces hydrogels with low strength, whereas chemical fabrication yields strong hydrogels that are not biocompatible. New approaches and integration of existing methods are needed to produce an injectable hydrogel with ideal properties.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been always threatening to health. It is significant to establish an effective strategy for HBV carriers and hepatitis B patients diagnosis at early stage of infection in clinic. Herein, we combined nested PCR, chemiluminescence assay and magnetic separation technology to establish a highly sensitive and stable strategy for low-abundance HBV-DNA detection. Six types of monodisperse Fe\u2083O\u2084 magnetic beads (MBs) were fabricated and coated with SiO\u2082 layer (MBs@SiO\u2082). The effect of MBs@SiO\u2082 size on HBV-DNA extraction and chemiluminescence assay was explored, and results displayed that the MBs@SiO\u2082-F particles with largest size were much more suitable for HBV-DNA extraction than others, and MBs@SiO\u2082-C with the size range between 330 nm-450 nm performed best in chemiluminescence assay. As one of key factors, the concentration (or density) of the probe fixed on MBs@SiO\u2082 surface was optimized for chemiluminescence assay, exhibiting the best assay result when reaction system contained 2.0 M of probe. Finally, under the best reaction conditions, low-abundance HBV serum specimens were sensitively and stably detected, and the result of HBV specimen with 34 copy/mL loads showed significant difference with negative and blank ( < 0.001).",

        "abstract": "Exosomes have been recognized as promising sources of biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis due to their important role in the occurrence and metastasis of cancer, and so the development of a sensitive low-cost detection method for exosomes is highly desirable. In this paper, we report a fluorescence method for the competitive detection of exosomes based on an aptamer specific to CD63 (an exosome transmembrane protein). Aptamer-modified magnetic beads were hybridized with a Cy3-labeled short sequence complementary to a region of the aptamer. In the presence of exosomes, the CD63 on the exosomes bound to the aptamer, resulting in the shedding of the short sequence into the supernatant. The quantity of the exosomes could be estimated by detecting the fluorescence intensity in the supernatant. This method could detect exosomes at a concentration as low as 1.0 \u00d7 105 particles per \u03bcL under optimal conditions, and the feasibility of the method for exosome detection in complex clinical samples was also proved using simulated serum samples.

        "abstract": "Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA), mainly exhibit extracellular matrix loss and condylar cartilage degradation, is the most common chronic and degenerative maxillofacial osteoarthritis; however, no efficient therapy for TMJ-OA exists due to the poor understanding of its pathological progression. MicroRNA (miR)-140-5p is a novel non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) that expressed in osteoarthritis specifically. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of miR-140-5p in TMJ-OA, primary mandibular condylar chondrocytes (MCCs) from C57BL/6N mice were treated with interleukins (IL)-1\u03b2 or transfected with miR-140-5p mimics or inhibitors, respectively. The expression of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-13, miR-140-5p, nuclear factor (NF)-kB, Smad3 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b23 were examined by western blotting or quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The interaction between the potential binding sequence of miR-140-5p and the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of Smad3 mRNA was testified by dual-luciferase assay. Small Interfering RNA of Smad3 (Si-Smad3) was utilized to further identify the role of Smad3 mediated by miR-140-5p. The data showed MMP13, miR-140-5p and NF-kB increased significantly in response to IL-1\u03b2 inflammatory response in MCCs, meanwhile, Smad3 and TGF-\u03b23 reduced markedly. Moreover, transfection of miR-140-5p mimics significantly suppressed the expression of Smad3 and TGF-\u03b23 in MCCs, while miR-140-5p inhibitors acted in a converse manner. As the luciferase reporter of Smad3 mRNA observed active interaction with miR-140-5p, Smad3 was identified as a direct target of miR-140-5p. Additionally, the expression of TGF-\u03b23 was regulated upon the activation of Smad3. Together, these data suggested that miR-140-5p may play a role in regulating mandibular condylar cartilage homeostasis and potentially serve as a novel prognostic factor of TMJ-OA-like pathology.",

        "abstract": "Chondrogenic differentiation is a coordinated biological process orchestrated by various cell signaling pathways, involving complex pathways regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in the modulation of multiple cell processes. However, the potential roles of lncRNAs and their regulatory mechanisms in chondrogenic differentiation remain largely unclear. In this study, microarray was performed to detect the expression profiles of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) during chondrogenic differentiation of murine chondrogenic cell line ATDC5. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed to explore their functions. Coding-noncoding co-expression (CNC) and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were also constructed with bioinformatics methods. The results revealed that 1009 lncRNAs and 1206 mRNAs were differentially regulated during chondrogenic differentiation. GO and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the principal functions of the transcripts were associated with system development and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. The CNC network showed that lncRNA AK136902 was positively correlated with prostaglandin F receptor (FP). The ceRNA network covered 3 lncRNAs, 121 miRNAs and 241 edges. The upregulated lncRNA AK136902, AK016344, and ENSMUST00000180767 might promote chondrogenic differentiation by acting as ceRNAs. Knockdown of lncRNA AK136902 could inhibit the mRNA expression of FP and other chondrogenic related genes, including Aggrecan and Col2a1 during chondrogenic differentiation. Our results provide a new perspective on the modulation of lncRNAs during chondrogenic differentiation.",

We hypothesize that physical cues may positively affect the reprogramming process, and studied the effects of periodic mechanical stretch, substrate stiffness and microgrooved substrate on reprogramming yield. Subjecting reprogramming fibroblasts to periodic mechanical stretch and different substrate stiffness did not improve reprogramming yield. On the other hand, culturing the cells on microgrooved substrate enhanced the expression of cardiomyocyte genes by day 2 and improved the yield of partially reprogrammed cells at day 10. By combining microgrooved substrate with an existing optimized culture protocol, yield of reprogrammed cardiomyocytes with striated cardiac troponin T staining and spontaneous contractile activity was increased. We identified the regulation of Mkl1 activity as a new mechanism by which microgroove can affect reprogramming. Biochemical approach could only partially recapitulate the effect of microgroove. Microgroove demonstrated an additional effect of enhancing organization of sarcomeric structure, which could not be recapitulated by biochemical approach. This study provides insights into new mechanisms by which topographical cues can affect cellular reprogramming.",

        "abstract": "Cell reprogramming to pluripotency is an inefficient process and various approaches have been devised to improve the yield of induced pluripotent stem cells. However, the effect of biophysical factors on cell reprogramming is not well understood. Here we showed that, for the first time, dynamic culture with orbital shaking significantly improved the reprogramming efficiency in adherent cells. Manipulating the viscosity of the culture medium suggested that the improved efficiency is mainly attributed to convective mixing rather than hydrodynamic shear stress. Temporal studies demonstrated that the enhancement of reprogramming efficiency required the dynamic culture in the middle but not early phase. In the early phase, fibroblasts had a high proliferation rate, but as the culture became over-confluent in the middle phase, expression of p57 was upregulated to inhibit cell proliferation and consequently, cell reprogramming. Subjecting the over confluent culture to orbital shaking prevented the upregulation of p57, thus improving reprogramming efficiency. Seeding cells at low densities to avoid over-confluency resulted in a lower efficiency, and optimal reprogramming efficiency was attained at a high seeding density with dynamic culture. Our findings provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of how dynamic culture condition regulate cell reprogramming, and will have broad impact on cell engineering for regenerative medicine and disease modeling.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies indicated that in elderly individuals, statin therapy is associated with a reduced response to influenza vaccination. The present study was designed to determine effects on the immune response to influenza vaccination induced by statin administration in a mouse model, and investigate potential approaches to improve the outcome of vaccination on the background of statin therapy. We fed middle aged BALB/c mice a high fat \"western\" diet (WD) alone or supplemented with atorvastatin (AT) for 14 weeks, and control mice were fed with the regular rodent diet. Mice were immunized with a single dose of subunit A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1) vaccine, either systemically or with dissolving microneedle patches (MNPs). We observed that a greater age-dependent decline in the hemagglutinin inhibition titers occurred in systemically-immunized mice than in MNP- immunized mice. AT dampened the antibody response in the animals vaccinated by either route of vaccine delivery. However, the MNP-vaccinated AT-treated animals had ~20 times higher total antibody levels to the influenza vaccine than the systemically vaccinated group one month postvaccination. We propose that microneedle vaccination against influenza provides an approach to ameliorate the immunosuppressive effect of statin therapy observed with systemic immunization.",

        "abstract": "Biologic products are large molecules such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, etc., which have already produced many new drugs for clinical use in the last decades. Due to the inherent challenges faced by biologics after oral administration (e.g., acidic stomach pH, digestive enzymes, and limited permeation through the gastrointestinal tract), several alternative routes of administration have been investigated to enable sufficient drug absorption into systemic circulation. This review describes the buccal, sublingual, pulmonary, and transdermal routes of administration for biologics with relevant details of the respective barriers. While all these routes avoid transit through the gastrointestinal tract, each has its own strengths and weaknesses that may be optimal for specific classes of compounds. Buccal and sublingual delivery enable rapid drug uptake through a relatively permeable barrier but are limited by small epithelial surface area, stratified epithelia, and the practical complexities of maintaining a drug delivery system in the mouth. Pulmonary delivery accesses the highly permeable and large surface area of the alveolar epithelium but must overcome the complexities of safe and effective delivery to the alveoli deep in the lung. Transdermal delivery offers convenient access to the body for extended-release delivery via the skin surface but requires the use of novel devices and formulations to overcome the skin's formidable stratum corneum barrier. New technologies and strategies advanced to overcome these challenges are reviewed, and critical views in future developments of each route are given.",

Here we report that double-layered peptide nanoparticles induced robust specific immunity and protected mice against heterosubtypic influenza A virus challenges. We fabricated the nanoparticles by desolvating a composite peptide of tandem copies of nucleoprotein epitopes into nanoparticles as cores and cross-linking another composite peptide of four tandem copies of influenza matrix protein 2 ectodomain epitopes to the core surfaces as a coating. Delivering the nanoparticles via dissolvable microneedle patch-based skin vaccination further enhanced the induced immunity. These peptide-only, layered nanoparticles demonstrated a strong antigen depot effect and migrated into spleens and draining (inguinal) lymph nodes for an extended period compared with soluble antigens. This increased antigen-presentation time correlated with the stronger immune responses in the nanoparticle-immunized group. The protection conferred by nanoparticle immunization was transferable by passive immune serum transfusion and depended partially on a functional IgG receptor Fc\u03b3RIV. Using a conditional cell depletion, we found that CD8 T cells were involved in the protection. The immunological potency and stability of the layered peptide nanoparticles indicate applications for other peptide-based vaccines and peptide drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "Skin vaccination using biodegradable microneedle patch (MNP) technology in vaccine delivery is a promising strategy showing significant advantages over conventional flu shots. In this study, we developed an MNP encapsulating a 4M2e-tFliC fusion protein and two types of whole inactivated influenza virus vaccines (H1N1 and H3N2) as a universal vaccine candidate. We demonstrated that mice receiving this tri-component influenza vaccine  MNP acquired improved IgG1 antibody responses with more balanced IgG1/IgG2a antibody responses and enhanced cellular immune responses, including increased populations of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 producing cells and higher frequencies of antigen-specific plasma cells compared with intramuscular injection. In addition, stronger germinal center reactions, increased numbers of Langerin-positive migratory dendritic cells, and increased cytokine secretion were observed in the skin-draining lymph nodes after immunization with the tri-component influenza MNP vaccine. The MNP-immunized group also possessed enhanced protection against a heterologous reassortant A/Shanghai/2013 H7N9 (rSH) influenza virus infection. Furthermore, the sera collected from 4M2e-tFliC MNP-immunized mice were demonstrated to have antiviral efficacy against reassortant A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 (rVet) and A/Shanghai/2013 H7N9 (rSH) virus challenges. The immunological advantages of skin vaccination with this tri-component MNP vaccine could offer a promising approach to develop an easily applicable and broadly protective universal influenza vaccine.",

The current Half-duplex (HD) medium access mechanism Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) has been directly applied to IBFD wireless networks. However, this is only able to support a symmetric dual link, and does not provide the full advantages of IBFD. To increase network throughput in a superior way to the HD mechanism, a novel three-way handshaking access mechanism RTS/SRTS (Second Request to Send)/CTS is proposed for point to multipoint (PMP) IBFD wireless networks, which can support both symmetric dual link and asymmetric dual link communication. In this approach, IBFD wireless communication only requires one channel access for two-way simultaneous packet transmissions. We first describe the RTS/SRTS/CTS mechanism and the symmetric/asymmetric dual link transmission procedure and then provide a theoretical analysis of network throughput and delay using a Markov model. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the RTS/SRTS/CTS access mechanism shows improved performance relative to that of the RTS/CTS HD access mechanism.",

This will decrease IBFD transmission opportunities by preventing simultaneous transmission in asymmetric dual link. In this paper, we propose a novel in-band Full-duplex Distributed Medium Access (FD-DMA) mechanism for wireless networks. Using this mechanism, both symmetric dual link and asymmetric dual link can be established by only one channel access. Moreover, all the neighbor nodes of primary transmitter and primary receiver can know exactly the IBFD transmission modes, which will increase the opportunity of IBFD communication and solve hidden nodes problem. The performance analysis and simulations show that the throughput of IBFD networks with FD-DMA mechanism nearly doubles that of the HD networks with RTS/CTS mechanism, and is much higher than that of IBFD networks with RTS/CTS mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies show that the statistical channel state information (SCSI) helps to largely increase the capacity of communication systems when the instantaneous perfect CSI is unavailable. In this paper, we consider multiuser multiple-input-single-output broadcast channels where the transmitter has the knowledge of SCSI. The major issue of concern in our paper is to improve the average group-rate of the whole system by scheduling users over different time slots. With SCSI at the transmitter side, we are able to precode signals and, hence, compute the theoretical achievable group-rate of arbitrary user groups. Based on the group-rates, we propose tier-2 Munkres user scheduling algorithm (T2-MUSA) that leads to higher average group-rate than existing algorithms with generally better fairness. The optimality of the proposed algorithm in energy-fair user scheduling space is proved and we derive a lower bound of a special case to verify the validity of our simulations. In addition, many conventional user scheduling algorithms maintain queue stability by solving a weighted sum-rate (WSR) problem, using queue lengths to represent weight coefficients. Inspired by T2-MUSA, we propose a QoS-based MUSA (QB-MUSA) aimed at stabilizing queue lengths and maximizing throughput. In results, we show that QB-MUSA exhibits higher throughput than the conventional WSR-based algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In In-band Full-duplex (IBFD) wireless networks, the RTS/CTS mechanism is unable to establish an asymmetric dual link and to recognize the transmission mode of communication nodes to capture more opportunities of IBFD transmission, which limits total network throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed IBFD MAC mechanism to establish symmetric/asymmetric dual link in wireless networks. Here we fully consider the two modes of asymmetric dual transmission. By medium access, the neighbors of communication nodes can clearly know network transmission status, which will provide extra opportunities of asymmetric IBFD dual communication. Finally, we develop a Markov model to characterize the non-saturation throughput of our proposed mechanism in IBFD wireless networks. The numerical results show that the throughput of IBFD network with our scheme nearly doubles that of HD network with RTS/CTS. Moreover, the non-saturation degree of the network has little influence on the throughput of our mechanism.",

In perfect CSI scenario, the weighted sum-rate maximization problem under cellular users\u2019 minimum rate constraints is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. To solve the challenging problem, we decouple it into two subproblems as power allocation and channel assignment. Then we proposed a power allocation algorithm based on difference of two convex functions programming and a channel assignment algorithm based on Kuhn\u2013Munkres algorithm, respectively. In statistical CSI scenario, we formulate the resource allocation problem as an outage probability constrained weighted ergodic sum-rate maximization problem. To solve the problem, the closed-form expressions of outage probability and weighted ergodic sum-rate are derived first. Then we decouple resource allocation problem into power allocation and channel assignment. An optimization solution that consists of a 2-D global searching and Kuhn\u2013Munkres algorithm is then developed.

In extremely low and extremely high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, we deduce the closed-form optimal precoders and a simplified analytic expression of the ergodic sum rate, based on which another algorithm leveraging bisection algorithm (BA) is proposed in the arbitrary-SNR.

We are concerned about the way how D2D pairs are matched with cellular users (CUs) to maximize their sum rate. In contrast with Munkres\u2019 algorithm which gives the optimal matching in terms of the maximum throughput, Gale-Shapley algorithm ensures the stability of the system on the same time and achieves a men-optimal stable matching. In our system, D2D pairs play the role of \u201cmen,\u201d so that each D2D pair could be matched to the CU that ranks as high as possible in the D2D pair\u2019s preference list. It is found by previous studies that, by unilaterally falsifying preference lists in a particular way, some men can get better partners, while no men get worse off. We utilize this theory to exploit the best cheating strategy for D2D pairs. We find out that to acquire such a cheating strategy, we need to seek as many and as large cabals as possible. To this end, we develop a cabal finding algorithm named RHSTLC, and also we prove that it reaches the Pareto optimality. In comparison with other algorithms proposed by related works, the results show that our algorithm can considerably improve the sum rate of D2D pairs.",

        "abstract": "Device-to-device (D2D) communications allow direct transmissions between two adjacent user devices, which can improve system performance in cellular networks. Considering full-duplex (FD) relaying outperforms half-duplex (HD) relaying in spectrum and energy efficiency, we apply the FD relaying-based D2D communication scheme in heterogeneous cellular network, which allows D2D links to underlay cellular downlink by assigning D2D transmitters as FD relays to assist cellular downlink transmissions. Although the scheme can improve the utilization of spectrum resource dramatically, the unreasonable resource sharing of D2D users will increase the inter-user interference. Therefore, in this paper, we try to optimize the throughput of D2D users on the premise of ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of cellular users. To this end, we first propose a D2D transmit power-allocation scheme and use Gale-Sharpley (GS) algorithm in matching theory to solve the resource allocation problem. Next, a Cheating algorithm based on cooperative game theory is proposed to further improve the throughput of D2D users. More importantly, due to the NP-hardness of finding the optimal solution of Cheating algorithm, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on depth first search (DFS) which using different colors to represent the different statements of D2D users to find a near-optimal solution. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm compared with GS algorithm can significantly improve the total throughput of D2D users, and it also has lower complexity and better throughput performance against existing Cheating algorithm.",

The fifth generation (5G) is a key enabling technology to revolutionize the future of industrial CPIoTS. In this paper, a communication framework based on 5G is presented to support the deployment of CPIoTS with a central controller. Based on this framework, multiple sensors and actuators can establish communication links with the central controller in full-duplex mode. To accommodate the signal data in the available channel band, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonconvex programming problem, aiming to maximize the sum energy efficiency of CPIoTS. By introducing the transformation, we decompose the resource allocation problem into power allocation and channel allocation. Moreover, we consider an energy-efficient power allocation algorithm based on game theory and Dinkelbachu0027s algorithm. Finally, to reduce the computational complexity, the channel allocation is modeled as a three-dimensional matching problem, and solved by iterative Hungarian method with virtual devices (IHM-VD). A comparison is performed with well-known existing algorithms to demonstrate the performance of the proposed one. The simulation results validate the efficiency of our proposed model, which significantly outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of meeting the energy efficiency and the QoS requirements.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a joint non-orthogonal multiple access and time division multiple access (NOMA-TDMA) scheme is proposed in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which allowed multiple sensors to transmit in the same time-frequency resource block using NOMA. The user scheduling, time slot allocation, and power control are jointly optimized in order to maximize the system \u03b1 -fair utility under transmit power constraint and minimum rate constraint. The optimization problem is nonconvex because of the fractional objective function and the nonconvex constraints. To deal with the original problem, we firstly convert the objective function in the optimization problem into a difference of two convex functions (D.C.) form, and then propose a NOMA-TDMA-DC algorithm to exploit the global optimum. Numerical results show that the NOMA-TDMA scheme significantly outperforms the traditional orthogonal multiple access scheme in terms of both spectral efficiency and user fairness.",

        "abstract": "The explosive growth of mobile data traffic poses challenge to the network architecture design. Caching popular contents on device level instead of infrastructure level, termed as distributed caching, can potentially alleviate the traffic load. As an emerging technology to decouple the control plane from the physical network topology, software-defined networking (SDN) promises to build a flexible, scalable, and programmable framework by enabling centralized network control and management. In this paper, assuming that user can leverage social networking and share contents via device-to-device (D2D) communications, we propose a SDN-enabled socially aware D2D caching scheme, in which Internet service providers split bandwidth into distinct slices and dynamically allocate these slices to content providers (CPs) for controlling traffic flows. Then, the CPs can provide share contents with content requesters for further traffic offloading. To improve the spectrum efficiency, we conceive this caching scheme with the architecture of hierarchical matching game. In this way, the combinatorial problem can be solved in two-stage. In the first stage, we propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm to allocate distinct bandwidth slices for differentiated quality-of-service requirements. In the second stage, we formulate the content sharing problem as a many-to-many matching game with externalities. To solve this complex matching problem, we design a novel distributed algorithm with faster converge speed. A joint solution is thus provided to solve the content sharing and power allocation problems iteratively by exploiting non-orthogonal multiple access. We conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate that our proposed schemes provide a better tradeoff between performance and complexity than other benchmarks.",

Given that smart objects which can exploit their own social networks and share contents via device-to-device (D2D) communications, the combined social IoT promises to collect information as well as to provide services more efficiently. This application scenario requires lower latency and higher reliability, and then we adopt D2D-based caching to reduce the downloading latency while guaranteeing the reliable delivery. To achieve this joint optimization objective, we conceive the interdependence with the framework of hierarchical bipartite graph. In this way, this combinatorial problem can be decoupled into a content sharing problem and a resource allocation problem. To solve the first one, we propose a content sharing-oriented matching algorithm with projecting social characters onto physical links. To solve the second one, we formulate this resource allocation problem as equivalent to a many-to-one matching game with peer effect. We then design a novel distributed algorithm with rotation-swap, which can converge to a stable state with limited number of iterations. Formulating the convergence procedure as another NP-hard problem, we further design a coloring-based heuristic algorithm to find a near-optimal solution. We conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate that our proposed schemes can achieve a better tradeoff between performance and complexity than other benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "The realization of full-duplex wireless communication is predictable. And asymmetric transmission is a practical and low-cost application scenario, where full-duplex access point (FD_AP) can communicate with two users simultaneously to receive and send packets. While, in an asymmetric transmission, the transmit power of uplink sender decides the uplink and downlink rates because of the inter-client interference, which accordingly restricts the throughput. Besides, the size of packets in uplink and downlink is generally unequal. Therefore, a WIFI network with a FD_AP and half-duplex users is studied in this paper, and a medium access control (MAC) protocol based on power control and rate selection (PCRS) is proposed. PCRS MAC employs a received signal strength based rate selection strategy to select different rates and power for uplink and downlink transmission. Then, FD_AP can establish efficient and reliable full-duplex asymmetric transmission. Simulation results show that PCRS can improve the throughput and the probability of successful asymmetric communication as compared to the distributed coordination function\u00a0(DCF) and a simple full-duplex MAC protocol without PCRS. Besides, PCRS MAC also maintains a high level of fairness.",

Owing to the lack of physical defense devices, data exchanged through WSNs such as personal information is exposed to malicious attacks. Therefore, intrusion detection is urgently needed to actively defend against such attacks. Intrusion detection as a data mining procedure cannot control the size of rule sets and distinguish the similarity between normal and intrusion network behaviors. Therefore, in this paper, an evolving mechanism is introduced to extract the rules for intrusion detection. To extract diversified rules as well as control the quantity of rulesets, the extracted rules are examined according to the distance between the rules in the rule set of the same class and the rules in the rule set of different classes. Thereby, it alleviates the problem that the quantity of rules expands unexpectedly with the evolving genetic network programming. The simulations are conducted on a benchmark intrusion dataset, and the results show that the proposed method provides an effective solution to evolve the class association rules and improves the intrusion detection performance.",

The complete tool chain for model development, execution, and reconfiguration is established. For the design phase, a machine-control-domain-specific modeling language and the supporting design environment are developed. With regard to the execution stage, a runtime framework compliant with the IEC 61499 standard is proposed. On the ground of the modeling environment and the reconfigurable run-time framework, a self-adaptive control module is developed to establish the close-loop self-reconfiguration infrastructure. The ontological representation of knowledge base toward this end is described, along with extendable SQWRL rules specified to automatically initiate the reconfiguration process in the cases of external user demands and internal faults. A prototype motion control kernel in the low-level layer of machine control system architecture is developed with the proposed modeling language and is then deployed to the run-time framework. Two case studies on self-reconfiguration of the proof-of-concept motion control kernel are demonstrated, which prove the feasibility of our proposal.",

        "abstract": "In the era of big data, traditional industrial mobile wireless networks cannot effectively handle the new requirements of mobile wireless big data networks arising from the spatio-temporal changes of a nodes traffic load. From the perspective of load balancing and energy efficiency, industrial big data (IBD) brings new transmission challenges to industrial wireless mobile networks (IWMNs). Previous research works have not considered dynamic changes related to the traffic and mobility of IWMNs. In this paper, using an IBD technique, we propose a novel second-deployment and sleep-scheduling strategy (SDSS) for balancing load and increasing energy efficiency, while taking the dynamic nature of the network into consideration. SDSS can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, changes in the traffic of every network grid and its maximum traffic load at different times are calculated using big data analysis techniques. In the second stage, a second-deployment method for the cluster head nodes (CHNs), based on each grids maximum traffic load, is adopted. To save energy, based on their position and traffic states, a sleep-wake scheduling is presented for the CHNs. Simulations results verify the effectiveness of this methodology to save energy and obtain a traffic balance, which is more efficient than obtained through traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "For modern equipment manufacturing industries, advanced manufacturing technologies have significant impact on the production quality and efficiency. Specifically, high-speed and high-accuracy technology is widely used in aerospace, automotive, and power-generation equipment to reduce the processing costs and improve the machining accuracy. However, the traditional velocity planning methods cannot satisfy the requirements of advanced equipment in point-to-point movement occasions. To solve these problems, a novel S-curve acceleration and deceleration (Acc/Dec) control model is proposed in this study, and the discretization of the Acc/Dec process was investigated. Furthermore, the derivation of the actual interpolation periods of each segment, actual achieved Acc/Dec, and actual achieved jerk of Acc/Dec zone are addressed in detail. To ensure the positioning accuracy and reduce the computational load, discrete formulae for the deceleration displacement, maximal achieved speed, and displacement of the constant acceleration segment are derived. To satisfy the product diversification and improve the efficiency, the function of the aforementioned S-curve Acc/Dec control algorithm was extended in this study. As a result, the end-point modification and target speed modification algorithms were developed. Finally, a series of numerical simulations and a real experiment were conducted. The results show that the proposed algorithms exhibit a good performance both in terms of reliability and efficiency. Thus, its feasibility was validated.",

        "abstract": "Polygonum perfoliatum L. is a Mn-tolerant plant as considered having the potential to revegetate in manganese mine wasteland. The glasshouse experiments were carried out to evaluate its tolerance and physiological response in different Mn concentrations (5, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10,000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L). Absorption bands of P. perfoliatum differed greatly in lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. With elevated levels of Mn (5-2000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L), absorbance changed little, which demonstrated that lower Mn concentrations had negligible influence on transport functions. As Mn concentrations in excess of 2000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L, absorbance increased slightly but eventually decreased. Furthermore, a hydroponic culture was carried out in order to study its changes of ultrastructure with the increasing Mn concentrations (5, 1000, and 10,000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L). Lower Mn levels with 5 and 1000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L had no breakage function to the ultrastructure of P. perfoliatum. However, as Mn concentration was up to 10,000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L, visible damages began to appear, the quantity of mitochondria in root cells increased, and the granum lamellae of leaf cell chloroplasts presented a disordered state. In comparison with the controls, black agglomerations were found in the cells of P. perfoliatum under the controlling concentration of Mn with 1000 and 10,000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L for 30\u00a0days, which became obvious at higher Mn concentrations. As Mn concentration was 10,000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L, a kind of new acicular substance was developed in leaf cells and intercellular spaces, possibly indicating a resistance mechanism in P. perfoliatum. These results confirm that P. perfoliatum shows potential for the revegetation of abandoned manganese tailings.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the structural and catalytic properties of co-doped perovskite oxide La0.8Ce0.2Mn1\u2212xCoxO3 are investigated. First, coal combustion catalysts of mesoporous perovskite-type La0.8Ce0.2Mn1\u2212xCoxO3 were prepared by using sol\u2013gel method. The resulting powder was characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller\u2019s test (BET), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Then, the results showed that after partially substituting La with Ce and substituting Mn with Co in LaMnO3, Ce occupied parts of the La site and Co occupied parts of the Mn site. As the substitution rate of Co increased, the pore diameter significantly decreased, and the specific surface area increased first and then decreased. Thirdly, thermogravimetric measurements and coal combustion constructed single-reaction model in the presence of the La0.8Ce0.2Mn1\u2212xCoxO3 catalysis indicated that the presence of catalysts reduced the reaction initiation temperature (Teo), the maximum mass loss velocity temperature (Tmax), and the completion temperature of the main pyrolysis (Tf). The addition of 5\u00a0% La0.8Ce0.2Mn0.9Co0.1O3 to coal caused the reaction initiation temperature (Teo) to decrease by 34\u00a0\u00b0C compared with coal alone. Lastly, a distributed activation energy model of 5\u00a0% La0.8Ce0.2Mn0.9Co0.1O3 obtained an activation energy distribution curve. Results indicated that the activation energy of samples at the primary pyrolysis stage did not present a single peak value but mainly accumulated at 140\u2013160\u00a0kJ, which could replace the mean activation energy of pyrolysis reaction. At the same time, frequency factor was not constant but presented a certain degree of linear correlation with activation energy, thereby indicating the presence of more than a single-reaction pyrolysis mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Various metal pollutants transported from certain sources may considerably contaminate the soil environment. It was reported that transportation related metal pollution was closely associated with the distance, the freight volume and traffic emissions. However, the effect of topography on the heavy metal distribution in the soils along transportation routes has received little attention. In the present investigation, arable soils along two selected transportation routes for mineral products were studied to characterize the topographic impacts on their level of metal pollution. Soil samples were collected within a 5-m radius following \u2018S\u2019 sampling procedure using spatial autocorrelation analysis. The descriptive statistics showed that most of the heavy metal (Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd) concentrations exceeded the background value of Zhejiang Province and contents of most metals in Area B, within a plain, were generally higher than in Area A, a valley within a hilly region. LISA maps showed that all heavy metals did not have similar spatial autocorrelation in Area B. The spatial distribution maps in Area A showed that distribution of most of the contaminants Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb had a similar spatial structure and were located along a transportation route. In Area A within valley topography, metal concentrations in soils were found generally to decrease with increasing distance from the road. However, this was not valid for Area B on the plain, where the metals concentrated in the soils could be derived from multiple sources, particularly emissions from nearby local industry.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe effects of Copper (Cu) on growth of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys heterocycla (Carr.) Mitford cv. pubescens) were investigated. The dry weight of Moso bamboo was inhibited and significant differences were evident under Cu stress as compared to the control (CK). Solution culture experiments indicated that Moso bamboo had a strong ability to accumulate Cu in shoots. Copper accumulation in the stem was stronger than the leaves; the stem/root ratio could reach 0.20 under Cu stress. The changes in cell walls, stomata, vacuoles, and starch grains content were observed via scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The ultrastructural analysis revealed that the excessive Cu concentrations caused deformities in the chloroplasts and transformation and even disappearance of endoplasmic reticulum. Moso bamboo as an experimental material serves as a new tool for remediation of heavy metal contaminated soils due to its metal tolerance and excessive biomass production.",
