        "abstract": "DEAD-box proteins are a large group of putative RNA helicases that exist ubiquitously in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. They are likely to play important roles in many different RNA metabolic processes. In this paper, we report the cloning of human DDX24, a putative DEAD-box protein, and its ortholog, Ddx24 in mouse. The deduced proteins encoded by these two cDNAs share 78.7% identity at the amino acid level and possess all the well-conserved motifs of DEAD-box proteins. However, little homology can be found between them and other DEAD-box proteins, even in their core region (identity <40%). Northern blot analysis showed that a 3.0-kb transcript of human DDX24 exists ubiquitously in the 16 human tissues examined and was most abundant in heart and brain, but with lowest levels in thymus and small intestine. The mouse Ddx24, whose transcript is 4.0 kb, was also expressed widely in 10 tissues tested with the highest level in heart and testis. By radiation hybrid mapping, the human DDX24 gene was localized to human chromosome 14q32 between the markers D14S81 and D14S265. Moreover, the gene structure of DDX24 was determined by comparing its cDNA and genomic sequence from BAC R-1089B7, which showed that the gene spanned a 30-kb region and consisted of at least nine exons.",

        "title": "Glass transition temperature of starch studied by a high-speed DSC",
        "abstract": "The glass transition temperature ( T g ) of corn starch was measured using a high-speed DSC with heating rate up to 250 °C/min. The high heating rate allows the weak T g of starch to be visible since the high rate increases the sensitivity of thermal events. For example, the T g of gelatinized corn starch containing about 13% moisture is too weak to be detected when the heating rate is lower than 50 °C/min, but is clearly visible when the heating rate is higher than 100 °C/min. Specifically, the technique was used to study the T g of corn starch film with different moisture contents. The true T g was calculated by the linear regression equation through plotting the results from different heating rates. Keywords Starch Glass transition temperature High-speed DSC 1 Introduction The glass transition temperature ( T g ) of starch is one of the critical thermal properties for starch-based products. However, measurement of T g by DSC is difficult since the change of heat capacity or the signal on heat flow is usually weaker than that of conventional polymers. For example, the heat of fusion for polypropylene is about 80 kcal/g ( Miller, 1989 ), whereas the measured energy for starch gelatinization is only about 0.95 cal/g ( Liu, Yu, Xie, & Chen, 2006; Lund, 1984 ). Furthermore, the multiple phase transitions that starch undergoes during heating and the instability (such as evaporation) of water contained in starch make it more difficult to study the thermal behaviour of starch materials using DSC ( Zeleznak & Hoseney, 1987 ). The instability of water contained in starch is also the reason why dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is not suitable for studying the T g of starch since the moisture evaporates during heating. Many attempts have been made previously using DSC to study the T g of starch and its products. There are significant differences in the results. For example, Zeleznak and Hoseney ( Yu & Christie, 2001 ) reported T g values of 30–90 °C for wheat starches with 13–18.9% moisture content, and postulated that the T g would be below room temperature if the water content was above 20%. Stepto and Tomka (1987) reported that extruded potato starch containing 15–20% moisture had a T g of about 25 °C. Van Soest, Benes, and De Wit (1996) reported the T g of extruded potato starch with 14% moisture at 5 °C and that the T g for moisture content above 14% could not be measured. Shogren (1992) reported that no T g was observed for the corn starch on the first scan and suggested that most of the polysaccharide was highly ordered. The glass transition temperature of corn starch containing 25–50% moisture was detected in the temperature range 20–60 °C on the second scan. Lourdin, Coignard, Bizot, and Colonna (1997) reported a T g at about 90–100 °C with 13–15% moisture content for potato starch. Rindlava, Hulleman, and Gatenholma (1997) reported a T g of 75–95 °C with 13–15% moisture content for potato starch, and the T g decreased linearly as the moisture content increased. Some researchers ( Biliaderis, 1992; Chinachoti, 1996; Maurice, Slade, Sirett, & Page, 1985 ) considered that DSC may not be suitable to study the T g of starch because the heat capacity of the transition is too weak and frequently is masked by the gelatinization endotherm. Theoretically, an increase of heating rate could increase the sensitivity of thermal events measured by DSC. The DSC output is a function of heat flow (mW) or energy per unit time (J/s). As the heating rate is increased, there is a greater input of energy per unit time and hence the same heat flow occurs over a shorter time frame. The result of an increase in the overall sensitivity allows the measurement of transitions that may be below the limit of detection possible by conventional DSC ( Gramaglia, Conway, Kett, Malcolm, & Batchelor, 2005; Katayama et al., 2008; McGregor, Saunders, Buckton, & Saklatvala, 2004 ). Recently a high-speed differential scanning calorimetry (Hyper-DSC), has attracted much attention for observing glass transitions using its extremely high controlled heating rate, up to 500 °C/min ( McGregor & Bines, 2008; Saunders, Podluii, Shergill, Buckton, & Royall, 2004 ). On the other hand, although a high heating rate can increase sensitivity, it also causes a lag in the thermal events, which delays the characteristic temperature ( T ). In order to eliminate the lag effect and obtain an accurate T , some adjustable methods are developed. One of them is the calibration method, in which a calibration should be done using a standard sample under the corresponding heating rate before the measurement of the experimental sample ( Oladiran & Batchelor, 2007; Silva, Nunes, Eusebio, Pais, & Sousa, 2006 ). In this work, another adjustable method, the extrapolation method, was used. Theoretically, the heating rate can only change the kinetics of a thermal event when all other heating conditions are constant, so the relationship between T and the heating rate should be linear. Through the linear regression equation, the extrapolated T can be obtained, which represents the theoretical T under an extremely slow heating rate (approaching 0 °C/min). In this work, the T g of starch was studied by a Hyper-DSC with heating rate up to 250 °C/min. The high heating rate increases the temperature of the thermal event, which allows the weak T g of starch to be visible. Corn starch was used as a model material. The true T g of samples with different moisture content is calculated using the equation of linear regression through plotting the results from different heating rates. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and sample preparation A natural corn starch (Huanglong Food Industry Co. Ltd. China), with moisture content of 13.5% was used in this work. Starch film was prepared by casting. A 3% starch suspension was first stirred and then heated to 98 °C, and kept for 2 h to fully gelatinize the starch ( Chen, Yu, Kealy, Chen, & Li, 2007 ), then cast on a glass sheet and dried by air flow at 50 °C for 24 h. The thickness of the film is about 0.12 mm. The film was stored in different relative humidity environments for 48 h to equilibrate the moisture content. The actual moisture contents of the film samples were measured by drying samples in a vacuum at 130 °C for 24 h and measuring weight loss. 2.2 Hyper-DSC A Perkin-Elmer DSC Diamond-1 with an internal coolant (Intercooler 1P) and nitrogen purge gas was used in the experimental work to confirm thermal behaviour. The instrument was calibrated for temperature and heat flow using indium and zinc as the standards under 10 °C/min. A baseline for an empty pan was established for each corresponding heating rate. Specimen with about 2 mg was sealed in an aluminium pan (PE No. 0219-0041). T g was taken at the half variation in heat capacity occurring at the transition. All results were the average of triplicate parallel experiments. All of the measured results, such as sample temperature, time, T g , and heating rate, were imported into Excel software to obtain the linear regression equation and linear dependent coefficient ( R 2 ). The R 2 was used to evaluate the linearity of variable X vs. Y , with the value of R 2 decreasing from 1 as the linear fit decreases. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 The linearity of sample temperature variation vs. time In order to study the thermal behaviours at high-speed, it is important to confirm the linearity of temperature variation vs. time under different heating rates. The linearity of temperature variation vs. time can be evaluated by Eq. (1) : (1) C p = dQ dT · 1 m = d dT · H m in which C p is the thermal capacity of sample; m is the mass of sample; Q is the input energy when heating or cooling; T is sample temperature; H is heat flow, H = dQ/dt ; t is time. It can be seen that only when dT/dt is a constant, then C p is directly proportional to H . In other words, only when the curve of temperature vs. time is a straight line, can the change of H directly represent that of C p . Fig. 1 shows the plots of temperature vs. time for a starch sample (11.6% moisture content) measured by Hyper-DSC. It can be seen that except for the temperature lag at the very beginning, the linearity of the sample temperature vs. time is very high. It means that the variation of H in heat flow curve can perfectly reflect that of C p . On the other hand, because of the lag in heat conduction and sample relaxation, the characteristic temperature ( T ) of thermal properties is delayed due to the high heating rate. Theoretically, if all experimental conditions are constant, such as the heat conduction of the pan and sample thickness, the heating rate can only change the kinetics of the thermal behaviour. In that case, the relationship between T and heating rate should be linear. Fig. 2 shows the DSC thermogram of indium under different heating rates. Fig. 3 shows plots of the onset temperature of melting vs. heating rates based on the data from Fig. 2 . It can be seen that as the heating rate increased, the size of the melting peak of indium also increased, and the onset temperature T o increased linearly. The linearity between the T o of indium and the heating rate is very high ( R 2 is about 0.9981) in the heating rate range of 20 and 300 °C/min. It indicates that the relationship between T o and heating rate is linear. Furthermore, from the linear regression equation, the extrapolated T p can be calculated. The result is 156.88 °C that is very close to the data from handbook (156.60 °C). 3.2 Glass transition temperature measured by Hyper-DSC Figs. 4–6 show the DSC thermograms of gelatinized corn starch containing different moisture levels under different heating rates. It can be seen that there is no clear step change being detected when the heating rate is lower than 50 °C/min. The size of the step change increased with increasing heating rate for all samples. The medial point of the step change ( T g ) increased with increasing heating rate for all samples. Due to moisture evaporation, there is an upward excursion on each curve when the temperature exceeds 95 °C. Fig. 7 shows the plots of measured T g vs. heating rate. It is observed that the T g increases linearly with increasing heating rate (with R 2 > 0.95). The slope and extrapolated T g calculated from the regression equation are listed in Table 1 . It is observed that the extrapolated T g increased with decreasing moisture content, which is expected. It is also noticed that the slope increased with decreasing moisture content, which indicates that the influence of the heating rate on the sample is different, and could be explained by different thermal conductivity. 4 Conclusions The glass transition temperature, T g , of corn starch films with different moisture content was measured by high-speed DSC. Since the high heating rate increased the sensitivity of thermal event, the glass transition of corn starch film, which was a very weak signal on conventional DSC, was enlarged and observable. The T g of gelatinized corn starch containing about 8.7–13.3% moisture is too weak to be detected when the heating rate is lower than 50 °C/min, but is clearly visible when the heating rate is higher than 100 °C/min. The linearity between temperature and time was confirmed by plotting dT/dt under different heating rates. The linearity between characteristic temperature ( T ) and heating rate was evaluated by plotting the melting onset temperature of indium vs. heating rates. Both linearities are very high with R 2 > 0.99. The extrapolated T g , which represents T g when the heating rate is extremely slow and approaching 0 °C/min, was calculated by regression equation. The extrapolated T g of corn starch film with 13.3%, 11.6% and 8.7% moisture content is 59.2, 61.4, and 67.3 °C, respectively.

We report here the cloning and characterization of the human orthologue NOB1 gene and its products. The human NOB1 gene is composed of nine exons and eight introns and is localized on human chromosome 16q22.1. The NOB1 cDNA is 1749 bp long and contains a putative open reading frame of 1239 bp. The predicted NOB1 protein comprises a PIN (PilT amino terminus) domain and a zinc ribbon domain. Western blot analysis showed that the molecular weight of NOB1 is about 50 KDa. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA from human adult tissues showed that NOB1 is expressed mainly in liver, lung and spleen. Expression of NOB1 in mammalian culture cells indicated that the NOB1 protein is mainly localized in the nucleus. Our data provides important information for further study of the function of the NOB1 gene and its products.",

        "abstract": "This work concerns how crosslinker amount (N, N'-methylene-bisacrylamide) affects the microstructural, absorbent and rheological features of one-step prepared starch-based superabsorbent polymers at a high starch concentration (0.27:1 w/w starch-water). The increased crosslinker amount evidently altered the microstructure and the absorbent and rheological features. Then, the variations in starch-based superabsorbent polymer properties were discussed from a microstructure viewpoint. Particularly, the higher crosslinker quantity rose the crosslinking density and the ratio (GR) of grafted anhydroglucose unit on starch backbone (from 27% to 52%), but short the average polyacrylamide (PAM) chain length (L). These structural features suppressed the chain stretch within starch-based superabsorbent polymer fractal gels (confirmed by smaller R value) and promoted the formation of smaller chain networks, thus weakening the water absorption to the starch-based superabsorbent polymer chain networks. Also, the increased GR and reduced L, with lowered chain extension and elevated crosslinking density, probably decreased the flexibility and mobility of chain segments in starch-based superabsorbent polymer gel matrixes. This caused the enhanced robustness and storage modulus of the gels with reduced chain energy dissipation ability.",

        "abstract": "Small GTPases form a big family including Ras, Rho, Rac, Rab, Sar1/Arf subfamilies and Ran homologs, playing important roles in diverse cellular processes. Through data mining, a novel human RAB41 gene was predicted and subsequently isolated from human testis. The open reading frame of RAB41 is 636bp in length. RAB41 was composed of three exons, and it was mapped to chromosome 3q21.3 by comparing with the human genomic data. RAB41 protein contains a RAB domain. Similarity analysis indicated that RAB41 is closely similar to RAB19. The results of PCR amplification indicated that human RAB41 is widely expressed in brain, testis, lung, heart, ovary, colon, kidney, uterus and spleen but not in liver. By genomic searching, an intronless pseudogene homologous to RAB41 at chromosome 16--RAB41P was identified at human chromosome 16q11.2. Flanking the pseudogene RAB41P in human genome, there exist some transposable elements LINEs--L1, whose contribution in the generation of this intronless homolog is discussed.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to investigate CYP1B1 gene mutations in patients of Han Chinese ethnicity with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), and explore the clinical characteristics associated with operative effects.Peripheral blood genomic DNA was extracted from patients with PCG to act as a PCR template. CYP1B1 mutations were identified from the amplified coding sequences of CYP1B1. A total of 238 patients, including 116 patients described previously, were used to examine the CYP1B1 mutation frequency. Of the 238 patients, 192 patients (306 eyes) who underwent first operative treatment from January 1991 to September 2007 in the Eye, Ear, Nose & Throat Hospital of Fudan University were analysed to investigate the relationship between clinical characteristics (including CYP1B1 mutation status) and surgical effect via statistical analyses (multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression).The frequency of CYP1B1 mutation carriers in Chinese patients with PCG is 17.2%, and nine novel CYP1B1 mutations were discovered. The median of onset age for patients with CYP1B1 mutations (2 months) is earlier than in patients without mutations (6 months). We identified that the mutant CYP1B1 gene, as well as poorer corneal transparency, was associated with better surgical outcome.Patients with CYP1B1 mutations tend to have a higher operative success rate in terms of better intraocular pressure control effect. The combination of the CYP1B1 genotype (with or without mutations) and preoperative corneal opacity score can partially predict the outcome of PCG surgery.",

Missense mutations in the membrane-bound transcription factor protease, site 2 (MBTPS2) gene have recently been identified in patients with IFAP.To determine whether Chinese patients with IFAP have MBTPS2 mutations.We observed a large IFAP pedigree of 5 generations in a Chinese family and performed MBTPS2 molecular analysis.The male proband was severely affected. He presented with hyperextensibility of the interphalangeal joints of the fingers in addition to previously reported clinical manifestations. Clinically affected female patients had hairless patches on the scalp, ichthyosiform skin changes, hypotrichosis, hyperkeratosis, nail dystrophy, and brown scaly plaques, some of which were arranged in a linear pattern following the lines of Blaschko. Molecular analysis identified a novel missense mutation in exon 11 and confirmed cosegregation of the missense mutation with the disease in this family.It is unclear whether hyperextensibility of the fingers was nosologically related to IFAP syndrome or was a coincidental finding.This report provides further evidence for the genetic basis of IFAP syndrome and enlarges the phenotypic spectrum and number of MBTPS2 mutations. We confirm that MBTPS2 mutations cause IFAP in patients of Chinese origin.",

        "abstract": "We identified a cadherin-like domain (CHDL) using computational analysis. The CHDL domain is mostly distributed in Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, although it is also found in some eukaryotic proteins. Prediction of three-dimensional protein folding indicated that the CHDL domain has an immunoglobulin beta-sandwich fold and belongs to the cadherin superfamily. The CHDL domain does not have LDRE and DxNDN motifs, which are conserved in the cadherin domain, but has three other motifs: PxAxxD, DxDxD and YT-V/I-S/T-D, which might contribute to forming a calcium-binding site. The identification of this cadherin-like domain indicates that the cadherin superfamily may exhibit wider sequence and structural diversity than previously appreciated. Domain architecture analysis revealed that the CHDL domain is also associated with other adhesion domains as well as enzyme domains. Based on computational analysis and previous experimental data, we predict that the CHDL domain has calcium-binding and also carbohydrate-binding activity.",

        "abstract": "A metal–organic framework (MOF)-mediated adsorption strategy is first developed for improving the anti-ultraviolet (UV) properties of poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers. In this work, UIO-66 was successfully anchored onto the surface of PBO fibers by one-step microwave-assisted heating method. The experimental results showed an obviously enhanced surface energy (91.1%), roughness (268.4%), interfacial shear strength (49.0%), and anti-UV properties (66.7%) compared to pristine PBO fibers. The anti-UV dye (tartrazine) was further immobilized onto the surface of PBO fibers via an adsorption strategy mediated by UIO-66. Interestingly, the PBO@tartrazine fibers demonstrated superior anti-UV performance (further up to 81.5%) compared to PBO@UIO-66 fibers. The extraordinary anti-UV properties of PBO@tartrazine fibers could be rationally ascribed to the synergistic effects of UIO-66 and tartrazine molecules.

        "abstract": "A widely recognized challenge in starch chemistry is to manipulate the graft copolymerization onto starch melt by reactive extrusion (REX). To understand the complex in-situ graft copolymerization in highly concentrated systems, we firstly used a mixer to achieve a homogeneous viscous starch melt, and then undertook dynamic rheological measurements to study the rheokinetics of the reaction. The in-situ synthesis also facilitated the characterization of the microstructures of reaction products. The melt mixture could be regarded to be completely micromixed since the rheokinetics was predominated by the reaction kinetics. The rheological characterization revealed that G'of hydrogels followed a linear progression with the crosslinker concentration. Nevertheless, the reaction temperature and initiator content had little influence on the final microstructure of hydrogels, most likely due to the strong chain transfer reaction in the melt. Additionally, high-amylose starches tended to form grafted hydrogels with a high physical crosslinking density.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in China. Hepatocarcinogenesis is correlated with a series of gene expression alteration. Here, we investigated LAMA4 gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma on both mRNA and protein levels, expecting to explore the relationship between expressional abundances of LAMA4 and the clinical characteristics of HCC specimens.Total RNA was extracted from 48 cases of surgically resected HCC specimens and their corresponding peripheral tumor-free liver tissues. After the optimal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction condition was established, the mRNA levels of LAMA4 in tumor and peripheral tumor-free tissues were examined semi-quantitatively. The relationship between expression levels of LAMA4 and clinical pathological characteristics was further analyzed by two-tailed t-test and chi2 test. We also used anti-LAMA4 antibody to detect the in vivo distribution of LAMA4 protein by tissue immunofluorescence staining in HCC specimens and their peripheral tumor-free tissues.The expression level of LAMA4 in 48 cases of human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in their corresponding peripheral tumor-free tissues (0.37 +/- 0.25 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.12, P < 0.01). LAMA4 gene was up-regulated in 30 (62.50%) cases of HCC, down regulated in 4 (8.33%) cases, and showed no significant changes in 14 (29.17%) cases. Analysis of relationship between LAMA4 gene expression abundances and clinical characteristics by chi2 test showed that up-regulation of LAMA4 was strongly correlated with tumor invasion (79.31%), incomplete or no envelope (75.00%) and tumor bolt (86.67%). Additionally, tissue immunofluorescence staining against LAMA4 protein detected strong signal only in HCC tissues but not their corresponding peripheral tumor-free liver tissues. To our attention, LAMA4 protein showed specific in vivo distribution along the basement membrane of tumor blood vessels, bringing insights into its potential role in tumor angiogenesis.LAMA4 is specifically up-regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in hepatocelluar carcinoma. The strong correlation between high expression abundances of LAMA4 with tumor invasion and metastasis, as well as, LAMA4 specific in vivo distribution in tumor basement membrane, indicated LAMA4's potential role in hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor progression. Therefore, we hypothesize that LAMA4 is probably a novel supplementary marker for HCC diagnosis, and might be a molecular target in the future cancer therapy.",

This paper reports a novel bi-phasic system based on two natural polymers, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) which has a thermal gelation behavior, and hydroxypropyl starch (HPS) which has a cooling gelation property. While both biopolymers have the same glucose unit grafted with propylene oxide, and are compatible to a certain degree, they were observed immiscible because of their different gelation behaviors. The immiscibility of these two compatible polymers could result in special structures leading to different blend film properties. Regarding this, the morphology, thermal transition, mechanical properties and oxygen barrier property could be well tailored by the ratio of two biopolymers and the environmental conditions. The knowledge obtained from this work could be useful for understanding other similar systems with desirable structure and properties.",

The coating was applied on starch based films by dipping the samples on AESO-based coating solutions, followed by crosslinking with ultraviolet (UV) light. Effect of AESO concentration, photoinitiator content and processing conditions on the performance of coated starch-based film was systematically investigated, in particular the effect of coating on moisture absorption, permeability and mechanical properties. The modified surface was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the moisture sensitivity of the starch-based sheets was reduced significantly since the crosslinked AESO acted as a hydrophobic layer. Moisture permeability was decreased more than 10 times after AESO treatment. It was found that the crosslinking density acted as one of the key factors, so even a very thin layer of AESO could achieve good water resistance.",

The TGF-β signaling pathway plays an important role in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. In mammalian cells, TGFB1 is the most abundant subtype of TGF-β. The 509 C/T polymorphism in TGFB1 has been implicated in colorectal cancer risk. However, published data remain conflicting. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis of 994 cases and 2,335 controls from five published case-control studies was performed. Overall, significantly increased colorectal cancer risks were found for CC versus TT (OR=1.62; 95% CI: 1.30-2.02; Pheterogeneity=0.118), TC+CC versus TT (OR=1.30; 95% CI: 1.08-1.58; Pheterogeneity=0.259) and CC versus TC+TT (OR=1.48; 95% CI: 1.26-1.75; Pheterogeneity=0.244). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were also found among Asians for CC versus TT (OR=1.77; 95% CI: 1.40-2.24; Pheterogeneity=0.519), TC+CC versus TT (OR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.13-1.68; Pheterogeneity=0.679) and CC versus TC+TT (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.31-1.89; Pheterogeneity=0.340). However, no significant associations were found among Europeans for all genetic models. This meta-analysis showed that TGFB1 509 C allele is a risk factor for developing colorectal cancer in Asians.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study evaluates the proapoptotic function of integrin β 3 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Experimental Design: The expression of integrin β 3 in 67 HCC specimens paired with corresponding neighboring nontumorous tissue was studied by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. The proapoptotic function of integrin β 3 in SMMC-7721 human hepatoma cells overexpressing ITGB3 (gene coding integrin β 3) was determined through colony formation, serum starvation, and anoikis assay. Results: Compared with neighboring pathologically normal liver tissue, -60% of the HCC specimens showed a significant down-regulated level of integrin β 3 expression. Transient expression of integrin β 3 in SMMC-7721 resulted in an enhanced level of apoptosis and suppression of colony formation. Cell growth inhibition on serum/ligand deprivation and incidences of anoikis were remarkably increased in SMMC-7721 with stable expression of integrin β 3 in comparison with vector control transfectants. In addition, expression of fibrinogen and vitronectin, two native ligands for integrin α vβ 3 in liver, was inhibited, which was correlated with the decreased integrin β 3 expression. Replenishing these ligands to the starved SMMC-7721 stable transfectants effectively restored the proapoptotic function of integrin β 3. Conclusions: Down-regulation of integrin β 3 and its ligands in liver is related to the aggressive growth of HCC. Thus, reconstitution of integrin in HCC may be a potential therapeutic approach to inhibit aggressive growth of liver cancer. © 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.",

        "abstract": "A fitting method combined with a linear correlation function was developed as an improved approach for the SAXS analysis of the semicrystalline lamellae of starch granules. Using a power-law function with two Gaussian plus Lorentz functions, the SAXS pattern was resolved into sub-patterns of the net lamellar peak and the power-law scattering plus scattering background (PL+B). The ratio of the net lamellar peak area (A) to the total scattering area (A) was proposed equal to the proportion of the lamellae within the starch granule (P). Along with this fitting method, we obtained a better profile of linear correlation function, with the elimination of the interference of non-lamellar amorphous starch (i.e., amorphous growth rings). Then, we could accurately calculate the lamellar parameters, e.g., P, the thicknesses of semicrystalline (d), crystalline (d) and amorphous (d) lamellae, and the volume fraction (φ) of crystalline lamellae within semicrystalline lamellae. Quantitative analysis revealed that P was positively correlated with the crystallinity (X) of starch. It was confirmed that the distribution of lamellar thickness was more important than the starch botanical origin in affecting the validity of the developed fitting method. We also proposed a criterion to test the validity of the proposed method. Specifically, the total SAXS pattern should be mostly tangent to the profile of PL+B at a high q tail (close to 0.2Å).",

In this study, we found that the receptor of activated C-kinase1 (RACK1), an important regulator of biological functions, interacted with Aurora-A and co-localized with Aurora-A at centrosomes. Moreover, RACK1 induces the auto-phosphorylation of Aurora-A in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of RACK1 impaired the activation of Aurora-A in late G2 phase, then inhibited the mitotic entry and leaded to multi-polarity, severe chromosome alignment defects, or centrosome amplification. Taken together, these results suggest that RACK1 is a new partner of Aurora-A and play a critical role in the regulation of the Aurora-A activity during mitosis, which may provide a basis for future anticancer studies targeting Aurora-A.",

        "abstract": "A metal-organic framework mediated adsorption strategy is firstly developed for improving the anti-ultraviolet properties of PBO fibers. In this work, the UIO-66 was successfully anchored onto the surface of PBO fibers by one-step microwave-assisted heating method. The experimental results showed an obviously enhanced surface energy (91.1%), roughness (268.4%), interfacial shear strength (49.0%) and anti-UV properties (66.7%) compared to pristine PBO fibers. The anti-UV dye (tartrazine) was further immobilized onto the surface of PBO fibers via adsorption strategy mediated by UIO-66. Interestingly, the PBO@tartrazine fibers demonstrated a superior anti-UV performance (further up to 81.5%) compared to PBO@UIO-66 fibers. The extraordinary anti-UV properties of PBO@tartrazine fibers could be rationally ascribed to the synergistic effects of UIO-66 and tartrazine molecules. Considering the diversities and functionalities of MOFs and targeted materials, our work indicates that the MOFs-mediated adsorption strategy would promisingly endow PBO fibers with other desired performance and applications such as solar-thermal transition and self-healing abilities.",

As the most critical part during object detection, an improved starch single shot multi-box detector (starch-SSD) originated from ANNs was purposely designed and applied in monitoring the morphological changes of starch with increasing temperature. In the case, the birefringences were automatically identified by computer vision and then the relative birefringence number of the image was calculated. Basing on such number change, the temperature of phase transition was detected and consequently the degree of gelatinization (DG) at specific temperature was quickly calculated. Compared with traditional methods that mainly performed by manual operation, experimental results confirmed that the proposed method has competitive accuracy and is much faster. It also provides a unified standard for microscopy observation without subjective uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Metazoans possess complicated multicellular structure among the multicellularities of eukaryotes. One evolutionary pressure that permits such complexity relates to the directed and precise informational transmission performed by numerous synapses in neuron system. Neurotransmitter inactivations play essential roles in the termination of synaptic transmission and are thus crucial for precise synaptic transmission. Here, we performed a genomic comparison among 11 eukaryotic organisms including five bilaterian species and six pan-unicellular eukaryotes to search for genes related to metazoan multicellular function. The result showed that the majority of genes related to neurotransmitter inactivation in the synaptic cleft endured high and stable selective pressure and were specifically present in bilaterians, whereas genes related to transmitter release and postsynaptic transmitter receptors did not show these properties. From these data we conclude that neurotransmitter inaction may play a critical role in the origin of the nerve system encountered in the early evolution of metazoan. In addition, we suggest that neurotransmitter inactivation probably participates in the formation or refinement of the synapse, following the concept of \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" Further experimental evidence is needed to support the suggestion and to explain the importance of neurotransmitter inactivation to metazoan multicellular function.",

The associations between the two eNOS polymorphisms (E298D rs1799983, -786T>C rs2070744) and breast cancer risk are inconclusive. A meta-analysis was performed in this study. By searching Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, CNKI, and SinoMed database, six case-control studies were collected for the eNOS E298D polymorphism (3,038 cases and 2,508 controls) and three case-control studies were eligible for the eNOS -786T>C polymorphism. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between the two eNOS polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. The pooled ORs were performed for codominant model, dominant model, and recessive model, respectively. Overall, significantly decreased risk was observed for E298D (for EE vs. DD: OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.59-0.94; for ED vs. DD: OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.61-0.98; for dominant model: OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.61-0.96) and -786T > C (for TT vs. CC: OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.42-0.86; for dominant model: OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.47-0.94). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant decreased risks were found for E298D (for EE vs. DD: OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.56-0.99) and -786T>C (for TT vs. CC: OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.35-0.81; for dominant model: OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.41-0.91; for recessive model: OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.55-0.91) among Caucasians; significant decreased risks were observed for E298D (for ED vs. DD: OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.02-0.96; for dominant model: OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.02-1.00) among Asians.

The\n oxidation of methionine (Met) to methionine sulfoxide (Met(O)) results in decreasing or loss of the biological activity of\n related proteins. It was found that peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (msrA) can reduce Met(O) to Met and therefore restored\n the biological function of the oxidized proteins. To reveal the methionine oxidation-reduction mechanism in human body, in\n this study, the cDNA sequence of bovinemsrA was used as an information-probe to screen the human EST database.

The cDNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 705 bp in length, which\n encodes 235 amino acid residues. Homology comparison revealed that human MSRA shares 88% and 61% identities with bovine andEscherichia coli msrA protein respectively. Expression pattern analysis revealed a single 1.6-kb transcript of humanMSRA in most human tissues and with highest expression in kidney. By radiation hybrid parlel mapping, the gene was localized to\n human chromosome 8p22-23 between markers D8S518 and D8S550. There are 2 human inherited diseases Keratolytic Winter Erythema\n and Microcephaly related genes in this region, it is inferred that humanMSRA might be the candidate of the two diseases.",

        "abstract": "Polymorphisms in the phospholipase C epsilon (PLCE) 1 gene play a crucial role in the development and progression of several types of cancer. The present study investigated the prognostic significance of PLCE1 gene polymorphisms and expression combined with serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) level in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped by sequencing DNA isolated from surgically resected tumor samples of 421 HBV-related HCC patients, and expression profiles were generated based on the GSE14520 dataset. A joint-effects analysis of PLCE1 haplotypes (Ars2274223Crs3765524; Grs2274223Trs3765524) with AFP level stratified at 20 ng/ml showed a significant association with overall survival(OS) of HBV-related HCC patients(log-rank P=0.0003). Patients with AC and GT haplotypes with AFP level ≥ 20 ng/ml had an increased risk of death as compared to those with the AC haplotype and AFP level < 20 ng/ml (adjusted P=0.029 and 0.041, respectively). Patients with the GT haplotype and AFP level < 20 ng/ml also had an increased risk of death, although with a non-significant P value (adjusted P=0.092). Joint-effects analysis of PLCE1 mRNA expression with serum AFP level stratified at 300 ng/ml was significantly associated with HBV-related HCC recurrence and OS. Our results demonstrate that PLCE1 haplotypes (including rs2274223 and rs3765524) and expression combined with serum AFP level may predict postoperative outcome of HBV-related HCC patients.",

In order to balance the trade-off between both of the aspects, a new fuzzy model based on experience-oriented learning algorithm is proposed. Firstly, support vector regression (SVR) with presented Mercer kernels is employed to generate the initial fuzzy model and the available experience on the training data. Secondly, a bottom-up simplification algorithm is introduced to generate reduced-set vectors for simplifying the structure of the initial fuzzy model, at the same time the parameters of the simplified model derived are adjusted by a hybrid learning algorithm including linear ridge regression algorithm and gradient descent method based on a new performance measure. Finally, taking the results from two-dimensional sinc function approximation and fuzzy control of the bar and beam system, the proposed fuzzy model preserves nice accuracy and interpretability.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a cytokine. The TGF-β signaling pathway plays an important role in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. In mammalian cells, TGFB1 is the most abundant subtype of TGF-β. The 509 C/T polymorphism in TGFB1 has been implicated in colorectal cancer risk. However, published data remain conflicting. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis of 994 cases and 2,335 controls from five published case-control studies was performed. Overall, significantly increased colorectal cancer risks were found for CC versus TT (OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.30-2.02; Pheterogeneity = 0.118), TC + CC versus TT (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.08-1.58; Pheterogeneity = 0.259) and CC versus TC + TT (OR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.26-1.75; Pheterogeneity = 0.244). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were also found among Asians for CC versus TT (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.40-2.24; Pheterogeneity = 0.519), TC + CC versus TT (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.13-1.68; P heterogeneity = 0.679) and CC versus TC + TT (OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.31-1.89; Pheterogeneity = 0.340). However, no significant associations were found among Europeans for all genetic models. This meta-analysis showed that TGFB1 509 C allele is a risk factor for developing colorectal cancer in Asians. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.",

Recent epidemiological studies have investigated the correlation of COMT Val158Met polymorphism with endometrial cancer risk; however, the results are inconsistent. To better evaluate the role of COMT Val158Met in endometrial carcinogenesis, we performed this meta-analysis, considering menopausal status, study quality, ethnicity, and source of controls.

Although no obvious associations were detected between COMT Val158Met and endometrial cancer susceptibility in the pooled analysis, we noted significantly decreased endometrial cancer risk for Val/Met versus Val/Val, and Met/Met + Val/Met versus Val/Val genetic models in the postmenopausal female (OR = 0.795, 95%CI = 0.656-0.962, P = 0.019; and OR = 0.819, 95%CI = 0.683-0.983, P = 0.032; respectively), and similar results existed in high-quality studies (OR = 0.835, 95%CI = 0.726-0.961, P = 0.012; and OR = 0.853, 95%CI = 0.747-0.974, P = 0.019; respectively). However, no evidence of association was noted in different ethnic groups and sources of controls. In conclusion, our results suggested that the COMT Val/Val genotype might act as a potential endometrial cancer risk factor in postmenopausal women. Further studies are needed to investigate the interactions between COMT Val158Met polymorphism and endometrial cancer in a specific population.",

It is suggested that the fragmentation process would have no effect on the particle attrition, which is much different from the previous work. Then the experimental method of coal static combustion and ash cold fluidizing is proposed to get the intrinsic ash formation data and attrition data. A concept of intrinsic ash formation is proposed. The intrinsic ash formation data are only dependent on the fuel itself, which should be considered as a parameter of fuel during the CFB boiler design.",

        "abstract": "The Aurora kinases play a critical role in mitosis and have been suggested as promising targets for cancer therapy due to their frequent overexpression in a variety of tumors. Compared with established inhibitors of cell division such as the anti-tubulins, novel agents target mitotic enzymes and show similar efficacy but with fewer side effects. Several small-molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases have been developed as anticancer agents, some of which have progressed to early clinical evaluation. Here we identified 3-hydroxyflavone as a novel Aurora B inhibitor through high throughput screening. 3-Hydroxyflavone showed potent inhibition to Aurora B with the IC(50) on a nanomolar basis in the enzyme-based kinase activity assay. In the cell-based western blotting analysis, 3-hydroxyflavone dramatically decreased the phosphorylation level of Histone H3 on the site of serine 10, demonstrating the potent endogenous Aurora B activity inhibition in cell level. The followed cell image analysis provided the consist result. To make it clear whether 3-hydroxyflavone inhibited Aurora B by direct binding or not, SPR analysis was carried out to measure the affinity of interaction between Aurora B protein and 3-hydroxyflavone and the result proved the binding with high affinity. Usually Aurora activity suppression induced cancer cell proliferation inhibition. Colony formation and cell viability with/without treatment of 3-hydroxyflavone were measured using CCK-8. The growth suppression under 3-hydroxyflavone present and the growth recovery after being released gave strong evidence that presence of 3-hydroxyflavone efficiently inhibited the fast growth of cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is one kind of serine/ threonine protein phosphatase regulating mainly cell growth and division. It comprises three subunits, A, B, and C. The B-subunit is involved in enzyme activity and substrate specificity. The B-subunit family is of great diversity and is divided into three classes, the B1, B2, and B3 subfamilies. Until now, two members of the B1 subfamily, B1alpha and B1beta, have been identified in human. In this report, the third member of the sub-family, B1gamma, was identified, and its cDNA was isolated from a human brain cDNA library. This novel cDNA is 4,120 bp in length and contains an open reading frame (nt 55-1,398) encoding 447 amino acid residues. The putative protein shares 81 and 85% identity with B1alpha (PPP2R2A) and B1beta (PPP2R2B), respectively, and was named PPP2R2C for its high level of homology to the other two isoforms. One remarkable characteristic of this novel gene is that it is highly expressed in brain with a 4.7-kb transcript while it is nearly undetectable in other tissues. In addition, the PPP2R2C gene was localized to human chromosome 4p16 between markers D4S2925 and D4S3007 with 5.45 cR (LOD > 14) and 2.63 cR (LOD > 15) RH distance, respectively, by radiation hybrid panel mapping.",

Aberrant expression of Aurora B has been shown to correlate with genetic instability and carcinogenesis. In the past, Aurora B has been validated as a drug target by several studies. Here we report that the dietary flavonoid luteolin could inhibit recombinant Aurora B in radiometric activity assay (IC(50)=0.357 μM) and bind to Aurora B with a high affinity (K(D)=5.85 μM) measured by Biacore 3000. Dose-dependent down-regulation of phosphorylation on Ser10 of histone H3 was also observed in cancer cell lines after 24-h treatment, indicating that endogenous Aurora B activity was inhibited by luteolin. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of luteolin on the survival of a panel of 23 cell lines, and found that luteolin blocked growth of HeLa cells and SW620 cells in an 8-day cell proliferation assay as well as in colony formation assay. Thus, we identified Aurora B as a novel direct target of luteolin, and our results demonstrated that targeting Aurora B by natural products may be a feasible strategy to develop low toxic anticancer agents.",

The captured SO 2 and NO emissions decrease with the decrease of the cluster porosity. The maximum SO 2 capture rate by the cluster is at a temperature between 1025 and 1055 K, whereas more NO emissions were found with the increase of the gas temperature.

Dataset from the GSE14520 is used as the training cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset as the validation cohort. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screening were performed by the  package. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), gene ontology, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and risk score model were used for pathway and genes identification.  GSEA revealed that several pathways and biological processes are associated with hepatocarcinogenesis, such as the cell cycle, DNA repair, and p53 pathway. A total of 160 DEGs were identified. The enriched functions and pathways of the DEGs included toxic substance decomposition and metabolism processes, and the P450 and p53 pathways. Eleven of the DEGs were identified as hub DEGs in the WGCNA. In survival analysis of hub DEGs, high expression of  and  were significantly associated with poor clinical outcome of HBV-related HCC, and shown a good performance in HBV-related HCC diagnosis. The prognostic signature consisting of  and  also doing well in the prediction of HBV-related HCC prognosis. The diagnostic and prognostic values of  and  was confirmed in TCGA HCC patients.  Key biomarkers and pathways identified in the present study may enhance the comprehend of the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocarcinogenesis. Additionally, mRNA expression of  and  may serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HBV-related HCC.",

This model is a combination of the two rules on protein-ligand interaction, Miyazawa-Jernigan (M-J) matrix and hidden Markov model (HMM). The model is applied to predict peptide inhibitors for the protein cyclophilin A (CypA) and FKBP12, and then validated by the highest occupied molecular orbital calculation, dock process between protein and inhibitor, and biological experiments. The results are encouraging and suggest that we have taken a step forward towards building a mathematical theory on the design of peptide inhibitors for proteins. The mathematical model is rough at present, but if it represents a correct direction of the theoretical trends of biology as we believe, then this theory can be further developed and become more and more precise.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. To date, many articles have evaluated the association between Cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17) T-34C polymorphism and breast cancer risk. However, the results remain inconclusive. In order to derive a more precise estimation of the association, a meta-analysis was performed in this study. By searching Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, CNKI, and SinoMed databases, 43 studies including 26,008 cases and 32,806 controls were collected for CYP17 T-34C polymorphism. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between CYP17 T-34C polymorphism and breast cancer risk. The pooled ORs were performed for codominant model, dominant model, and recessive model, respectively. Overall, no significant associations between CYP17 T-34C polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility were found for TT versus CC (OR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.89-1.05), TC versus CC (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.89-1.06), TT + TC versus CC (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.89-1.05) and TT versus TC + CC (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.93-1.03). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, menopausal status, and sources of controls, significant associations were still not detected in all genetic models. In conclusion, this meta-analysis strongly suggests that CYP17 T-34C polymorphism is not associated with breast cancer risk.",

        "abstract": "As an important cellular energy regulation kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been demonstrated as a key molecule in the development of tolerance to nutrient starvation. Activation of AMPK includes the phosphorylation of Thr172 of the alpha-subunit. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was originally isolated for its ability to stimulate both survival and differentiation in peripheral neurons, but many investigations have shown that the NGF also plays an important role in survival, growth and invasion of many human cancers. In this study, we used CCK-8 cell viability assay to find that NGF could facilitate the viability of HeLa cells following glucose deprivation while not in glucose-normal control groups. This effect of NGF-induced viability promotion to glucose starvation can be suppressed by Compound C, a specific inhibitor of AMPK. Meanwhile, western blot analysis showed that AMPKalpha1/alpha2 Thr172 phosphorylation level in HeLa cells was up-regulated after NGF treatment under glucose starvation, and Compound C was able to reduce the AMPKalpha1/alpha2 Thr172 phosphorylation level which was up-regulated by NGF in HeLa cells. Taken together, these results indicate that AMP-activated protein kinase supports the NGF-induced viability of human HeLa cells to glucose starvation.",

        "abstract": "The effects of starch structures, in particular amylose content, on grafting reactions were investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray diffraction (XRD). As a model system, corn starches with different amylose contents (0, 26, 50 and 80 %) were grafted onto acrylamide to produce superabsorbent polymers (SAPs). The weight loss measured by TGA at different temperature was used to analyze the grafting ratio in quantity. In general, the grafting ratio increased (about 10 %) with increasing starch amylose content, and graft chain segment lengths were much lower for the amylopectin-rich (waxy) starch. The high molecular weight and branched structure of the amylopectin reduced the mobility of the polymer chains and increased viscosity, which resulted in resistance to chain growth. The water absorption capability was increased with increasing amylose content for the starch-based SAPs. XRD detection showed that the crystalline structure of all starches was destroyed after grafting reactions. The thermal stability of the polyacrylamide grafted onto the starches increased by about 10 °C, which could be explained by the strong bonding between the grafted polymer chains and the starch matrices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing of the exome and genome of prostate cancers has identified numerous genetic alternations. SPOP (Speckle-type POZ Protein) was one of the most frequently mutated genes in primary prostate cancer, suggesting SPOP is a potential driver of prostate cancer development and progression. However, how SPOP mutations contribute to prostate cancer pathogenesis remains poorly understood. SPOP acts as an adaptor protein of the CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that generally recruits substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. ER-localized isoform of the formin protein inverted formin 2 (INF2) mediates actin polymerization at ER-mitochondria intersections and facilitates DRP1 recruitment to mitochondria, which is a critical step in mitochondrial fission. Here, we revealed that SPOP recognizes a Ser/Thr (S/T)-rich motif in the C-terminal region of INF2 and triggers atypical polyubiquitination of INF2. These ubiquitination modifications do not lead to INF2 instability, but rather reduces INF2 localization in ER and mitochondrially associated DRP1 puncta formation, therefore abrogates its ability to facilitate mitochondrial fission. INF2 mutant escaping from SPOP-mediated ubiquitination is more potent in prompting mitochondrial fission. Moreover, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants increase INF2 localization in ER and promote mitochondrial fission, probably through a dominant-negative effect to inhibit endogenous SPOP. Moreover, INF2 is important for SPOP inactivation-induced prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. These findings reveal novel molecular events underlying the regulation of INF2 function and localization, and provided insights in understanding the relationship between SPOP mutations and dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics in prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "T-complex protein 10A homolog 2 (TCP10L) was previously demonstrated to be a potential tumor suppressor in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism. MAX dimerization protein 1 (MAD1) is a key transcription suppressor that is involved in regulating cell cycle progression and Myc-mediated cell transformation. In this study, we identified MAD1 as a novel TCP10L-interacting protein. The interaction depends on the leucine zipper domain of both TCP10L and MAD1. TCP10L, but not the interaction-deficient TCP10L mutant, synergizes with MAD1 in transcriptional repression, cell cycle G1 arrest and cell growth suppression. Mechanistic exploration further revealed that TCP10L is able to stabilize intracellular MAD1 protein level. Consistently, the MAD1-interaction-deficient TCP10L mutant exerts no effect on stabilizing the MAD1 protein. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that TCP10L stabilizes MAD1 protein level through direct interaction, and they cooperatively regulate cell cycle progression.

In this paper, Haake Rheometer and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to study TPS's rheological and phase transition properties under the plasticization of glycerol. The results show that: the plasticization effect of glycerol is different from that of water. On one hand, the change of torque is caused by the phase transition of starch; On the other hand, it is caused by the material feeding of glycerol which can lubricate starch while goes against the plasticization of starch. Consequently, with the increase of glycerol, the plasticization degree of TPS decreases firstly, but increases later. What's more, the high roller speed can enhance shear force, so can intensify the plasticization degree of TPS. Similarly, the high temperature can also accelerate the plasticization of TPS, which is even more notably.",

Addition of crystals increased the Youngu0027s modulus and tensile strength of starch-based materials and decreased elongation at break. Scanning electron microscopic observation indicated good compatibility between starch matrix and the reinforcing fillers due to same chemical unit (glucose). Cellulose crystals have higher thermal stability than that of starch crystals; this provides better processibility and superior mechanical properties to starch films filled with cellulose crystals. On the other hand, starch films filled with starch crystals demonstrated higher protection againstUV radiation.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Effect of pressure with shear stress on the gelatinization of cornstarch with different amylose/amylopectin ratios (waxy 0/100; maze 23/77; G50 50/50; G80 80/20) was systematically investigated using a high-pressure rheometer. Onset and peak temperature of starch gelatinization as well as the peak viscosity were used to discuss the influence of pressure together with shear stress on the gelatinization of starch granules. The results showed that without shear stress, pressure could resist the gelatinization process due to weak swelling of starch granules and lower quantity of amylose released. However, the shear stress can simply counteract the influence of the pressure since its impact is much high on gelatinization. Under certain pressure and shear stress, both onset and peak temperatures of gelatinization were increased with increasing amylose content, which is in correspondence with the results from differential scanning calorimeter measurement, while the overall viscosity was lower when starches with a higher amylose content was used because part of its granular was not fully dissolved during the measurement. SAXS measurements were used to study the gel structure and stability of starch suspensions. It was found that the scattering intensity of starches in the measured range (0.1–1.0 nm −1 ) is G80 u003e waxy, indicating the amount of ordered semi-crystalline structures in amylose is higher. Peak values, q = 0.4 nm −1  and q = 0.2 nm −1 , detected for waxy starch under different shear rates, indicates that higher shear stress which plays a dominant role compared with pressure, resulted in more degradation in amylopectin, inhibiting the formation of aggregate structure.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal malignancy with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. The identification of prognosis‑associated biomarkers is crucial to improve HCC patient survival. The present study aimed to explore potential predictive biomarkers for HCC. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed in the GSE36376 dataset using GEO2R. Hub genes were identified and further investigated for prognostic value in HCC patients. A risk score model and nomogram were constructed to predict HCC prognosis using the prognosis‑associated genes and clinical factors. Pearson's correlation was employed to show interactions among hub genes. Gene enrichment analysis was performed to identify detailed biological processes and pathways. A total of 71 DEGs were obtained and seven (ADH4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP8B1, SLC22A1, TAT and HSD17B13, all adjusted P≤0.05) of the 10 hub genes were identified as prognosis‑related genes for survival analysis in HCC patients, including alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (class II), pi polypeptide (ADH4), cytochrome p450 family 2 subfamily C member 8 (CYP2C8), cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (CYP2C9), cytochrome P450 family 8 subfamily B member 1 (CYP8B1), solute carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1), tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and hydroxysteroid 17‑β dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13). The risk score model could predict HCC prognosis and the nomogram visualized gene expression and clinical factors of probability for HCC prognosis. The majority of genes showed significant Pearson's correlations with others (41 Pearson correlations P≤0.01, four Pearson correlations P>0.05). GO analysis revealed that terms such as 'chemical carcinogenesis' and 'drug metabolism‑cytochrome P450' were enriched and may prove helpful to elucidate the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis. Hub genes ADH4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP8B1, SLC22A1, TAT and HSD17B13 may be useful as predictive biomarkers for HCC prognosis.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTAlthough alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flooding is successfully applied in oil fields, some disadvantages such as scales, corrosion effects, and viscosity reductions of polymer solutions appear. Usage of organic alkalis can avoid or decrease these disadvantages. In this paper, the physicochemical properties, including interfacial tension (IFT), and viscosity, of organic alkali combinational flooding solutions and their effectiveness as enhanced oil recovery agents are investigated. Monoethanolamine (MEA) is the optimal one for decreasing the IFT among the three organic alkalis studied in this paper. Although MEA cannot decrease the IFT as low as NaOH does, it has good compatibility with both surfactant and the polymer hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). MEA not only helps a surfactant solution or HPAM/surfactant mixture attain ultralow IFT values, but can also promote better viscosity stability for HPAM or HPAM/surfactant solutions compared to NaOH. Moreover, core flood experiments show that add...",

        "abstract": "RTNs (reticulons) is a gene family related to the growth and differentiation of neuroendocrine cell. This family is composed of\n several members such asRTN1, RTN2 andRTN3. RTN1 andRTN2 have been proved to have 3 transcripts with different length. Because theRTN1c cDNA was involved in the sologenesis of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), it was selected as a bioinformatic probe to clone\n novel members ofRTN family with the electric hybridization assistant new-gene cloning method (EHAC). A 1677-bp cDNA was identified from human\n brain cDNA library. The cDNA contains an intact open reading frame (ORF) which encodes a protein of 199 amino acids. This\n deduced protein is highly homologous to RTN1c, RTN2c and RTN3 with identities of 64.4% 45.8% and 50.0% respectively. This\n new gene was namedRTN4c (GenBank accession number: AF087901). Northern hybridization showed that the full length ofRTN4c transcript is about 1.8 kb. It is hardly expressed in heart, placenta, lung, spleen, thymus, testis, ovary, small intestine\n and peripheral blood white cells; but it is highly expressed in the tissues of skeletal muscle, brain, liver and kidney, and\n less expressed in the pancreas, prostate and colon. Furthermore, Northern results also showed that there is a 2.3 kb transcript\n expressed in 14 tissues except liver and skeletal muscle; while another 5.0 kb transcript in brain, skeletal muscle and testis.\n By the electric hybridization walking, we obtained two full-length contigs with a length of 4632 and 2235 bp respectively.\n The former encodes a protein with 1192 amino acids and was defined as RTN4a: the latter encodes another protein with 373 amino\n acids. and was named RTN4b.

Multiple gas transport mechanisms coexist in porous media with complex pore size distribution, including viscous flow, Knudsen diffusion and surface diffusion. During pressure depletion of a reservoir, the adsorbed gas desorbs into pore space as additional ‘free gas’, and meanwhile, diffuses along the surface of nanopores in porous media. The surface diffusion itself increases the total gas transport capacity in pores and its effect cannot be neglected. The bulk gas transport (non-surface diffusion) data was excluded experimentally to intensively investigate the surface diffusion during gas mass transport based on the gas storage and flow mechanisms. Accordingly, a mathematical model is developed by incorporating the surface diffusion. The results show that the equilibrium time for gas transport process decreases quickly with temperature. Higher saturation pressure could accelerate the process and increase the amount of produced gas. Besides, the two-stage process of the gas mass transport can be identified by recording the decay of gas pressure, which implies that the surface diffusion dominates the late stage of the gas mass transport. The surface diffusion coefficient for shale is between 10 −18  and 10 −16  m 2 /s. This study provides a straightforward method to describe the gas mass transport in shale, simple but information–rich for the assessment of shale gas targets.",

As a delivery carrier material, the characteristics of OSAS were investigated. The resistant starch (RS) content of OSAS was increased with increasing DS, indicating the improvement of colon-targeting property. The swelling ratio (SR) of the OSAS in simulated gastrointestinal fluids was higher than that of native starch and its hydrophilicity was decreased with increasing DS. For in vitro release study, the percentage of released bioactive components was less than 7% within the first 8 h and close to 100% over a period of 36 h when the DS was 0.60.

Various nanoclay dispersions were prepared (either by standard mixing or through the use of ultrasonics) prior to their combination with a high amylose content starch using high-speed mixing and extrusion technology. Intercalated and exfoliated type structures were observed in the sheet extruded nanocomposites using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Due to the hydrophilic nature of the gelatinized starch nanocomposite a novel preparatory technique was developed to produce nano scale sections for TEM. A range of plasticiser levels were used in conjunction with different unmodified nanoclays (sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) and fluorohectorite (Na-FHT)) having different cationic exchange capacities. It was shown that an optimum level of both plasticiser and nanoclay existed to produce a gelatinized starch film with the highest levels of exfoliation, resulting in superior properties. The use of ultrasonics was only advantageous in terms of clay dispersions at medium clay concentrations in the Na-MMT nanocomposites and higher clay concentrations in the Na-FHT, most probably due to the difference in cationic exchange capacity; however when the level of clay, water and starch was optimised an exfoliated structure was produced via standard mixing which exhibited comparable improvements in mechanical properties to ultrasonically treated samples.",

        "abstract": "Cyclophilin J (CyPJ), also called peptidylprolyl isomerase like 3, has been identified as a novel member of the cyclophilin family. Our previous research has resolved the three-dimensional structure of CyPJ and demonstrated the peptidylprolyl - isomerase (PPIase) activity of CyPJ, which can be inhibited by the common immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA). Importantly, CyPJ is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and promotes tumor growth; CyPJ inhibition by CsA- or siRNA-based knockdown results in a remarkable suppression of HCC. These findings suggest that CyPJ may be a potential therapeutic target for HCC, and discovery of relevant inhibitors may facilitate development of a novel CyPJ-based targeting therapy. However, apart from the common inhibitor CsA, CyPJ has yet to be investigated as a target for cancer therapy. Here, we report structure-based identification of novel small molecule non-peptidic CyPJ inhibitors and their potential as antitumor lead compounds. Based on computer-aided virtual screening, , and subsequently surface plasmon resonance analysis, 19 potential inhibitors of CyPJ were identified and selected for further evaluation of PPIase CyPJ inhibition . Thirteen out of 19 compounds exhibited notable inhibition against PPIase activity. Among them, the compound , with a quinoxaline nucleus, showed potential for tumor inhibition; thus, we selected it for further structure-activity optimization. A total of 22 chemical derivatives with 2,3-substituted quinoxaline-6-amine modifications were designed and successfully synthesized. At least 2 out of the 22 derivatives, such as  and , demonstrated remarkable inhibition of tumor cell growth, comparable to CsA but much stronger than 5-fluorouracil. These results indicate that these two small molecules represent novel potential lead compounds for CyPJ-based antitumor drug development.",

        "abstract": "Protein phosphatase 3 (PPP3, formerly PP2B, Calcineurin), a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, is a heterodimer composed of one catalytic subunit (PPP3C, Calcineurin A) and one regulatory subunit (PPP3R, Calcineurin B). PPP3R, an EF-hand Ca2+ binding protein, contains four high-affinity EF-hand calcium-binding sites, indicating that PPP3 plays critical roles in many calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways. PPP3R has two isoforms, PPP3R1 (also known as PP2Bbeta1) and PPP3R2 (also known as PP2BB2). While PPP3R1 is ubiquitously expressed in different tissues, PPP3R2 is exclusively expressed in testis. PPP3R2 has only been identified in rat and mouse. Here we report a human homologue of PPP3R2, which is designated PPP3RL (PPP3R like protein). PPP3RL gene was predicated to encode 171 amino acid residues with four EF-hand calcium-binding domains and this putative protein shares 82.9% and 80.5% identity with PPP3R2 of rat and mouse, respectively. Our results show that PPP3RL gene localizes to human chromosome 9q22 and transcripts of PPP3RL gene are specifically expressed in the testis, moreover, this tissue-specific expression is due to demethylation of its promoter region in testis.",

        "abstract": "One-step extrusion techniques (combining compounding and product extrusion together) have been developed to minimize the decomposition of polyesters during thermal processing. Such treatment is particularly meaningful for the application of biodegradable polyester composites reinforced with the fillers containing moisture or hydroxyl groups, such as cellulose and starch etc. Poly (lactic acid)/starch composites was used as a model system in this work. Two kinds of one-step extrusion systems have been developed through (1) a twin screw extruder connecting with a single extruder, and (2) a twin screw extruder with a single screw zone respectively. The comparison between the one-step and two-step extrusions has been carried out based on their microstructures and performances via characterizations of molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, as well as tensile and drop impact testing. The results demonstrated that mechanical properties of samples were enhanced with the one-step extrusion preparation, comparing with the two-step processing, particularly in toughness and tensile strength, mainly because the one-step methods reduced the decomposition of polyesters during the thermal processing. It is also expected that the one-step extrusions technology will decrease the processing cost by reducing the amount of utilized energy, and can be used for the processing of other moisture sensitive polyesters.",

        "abstract": "Two novel members of the human cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) gene family, PKIB and PKIG, were cloned. The deduced proteins showed 70% and 90% identity with mouse PKIbeta and PKIgamma respectively. Both the already identified pseudosubstrate site and leucine-rich nuclear export signal motifs were defined from the 11 PKIs of different species. The PKIB and PKIG genes were mapped respectively to chromosome 6q21-22.1, using a radiation hybrid GB4 panel, and to chromosome 20q13.12-13.13, using a Stanford G3 panel. Northern-blot analysis of three PKI isoforms, including the PKIA identified previously, revealed significant differences in their expression patterns. PKIB had two transcripts of 1.9 kb and 1.4 kb. The former transcript was abundant in both placenta and brain and the latter was expressed most abundantly in placenta, highly in brain, heart, liver, pancreas, moderately in kidney, skeletal muscle and colon, and very little in the other eight tissues tested. PKIG was widely expressed as a 1.5-kb transcript with the highest level in heart, hardly detectable in thymus and peripheral blood leucocytes and was moderately expressed in the other tissues, with slightly different levels. However, PKIA was specifically expressed as two transcripts of 3.3 kb and 1.5 kb in heart and skeletal muscle. The distinct expression patterns of the three PKIs suggest that their roles in various tissues are probably different.",

        "abstract": "The Reticulon (RTN) family of proteins is thought to play important roles in the regulation of neuronal regeneration. In this study, we have identified a novel alternative splicing isoform of the RTN gene family, RTN3-A1, which contains an additional 2.3-kb exon. The transcripts of human and mouse RTN3-A1 (about 5.0 kb) were first discovered by database sequence mining and analysis, and verified by cloning and sequencing. Northern blot analysis of 16 human tissues with a common probe of RTN3 transcripts and a specific probe for RTN3-A1 demonstrated that human RTN3-A1 is expressed mainly in brain tissues with a weak expression in the skeletal muscle. With Western blot analysis, the expected 100-kDa RTN3-A1 protein was detected in mouse brain. In situ hybridization with a mouse RTN3-A1-specific cRNA probe revealed that the mouse RTN3-A1 mRNA was regionally expressed in the neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum of the adult mouse brain. In contrast to the transcripts of RTN1 and RTN2, RTN3-A1 shares some significant similarity with RTN4-A in exon structure, tissue distribution, and brain expression profile. Since other reports have shown that RTN4-A inhibits neuronal outgrowth and restricts the plasticity of the central nervous system, we speculate that RTN3-A1 might play certain roles in the central nervous system.",

The metal-organic framework was initially non-fluorescent, however, with the addition of doxycycline, the system exhibited significant fluorescence enhancement at 526 nm and 617 nm, where both fluorescence intensities showed good linear correlations with the doxycycline concentration, suggesting the possibility for direct two-channel detection without any sensitization materials such as metal particles or surface-modified quantum dots. More interestingly, the unique fluorescence response of the system could discriminate doxycycline from other tetracycline antibiotics with high selectivity, and a limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 47 nM. It has been further demonstrated that the material has been successfully applied as sensing materials for selective determination of doxycycline in real samples of fish and urine.",

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the thermoplastic starch and starch nanocomposites showed a number or variants in H-bonding between starch chains, PVOH and Na-MMT during extrusion processing. The addition of small amounts of PVOH to the starch nanocomposite produced a very ordered intercalated structure. The relative concentrations of PVOH and Na-MMT could be directly correlated to changes in intergallery spacings. Although good dispersion of clay platelets was important in improving mechanical properties in these nanocomposites the interfacial interactions of filler and matrix played just as important a role (the more agglomerated composites) containing both Na-MMT and PVOH showed significant increases in tensile strength (up to 67% increase) and tensile modulus (up to 85% increase) as compared to the more well dispersed composites without PVOH. The improvements in properties could be attributed to both interfacial interactions and the disruption of the retrogradation (recrystallisation process).",

        "abstract": "The TP53 gene has an important role in the protection of cells from DNA damage due to UV exposure, and sequence variation in the gene may alter skin cancer susceptibility. To examine the association between the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and skin cancer risk, we undertook a meta-analysis of 15 case-control studies involving 6,362 subjects. The quality of the studies was assessed according to a predefined scale. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed for association using a random-effects model. Overall, no evidence of association was observed between TP53 genotypes and the risk of skin cancer in any genetic model (Arg/Arg vs. Pro/Pro: OR=1.05, 95% CI: 0.71-1.55; Arg/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.68-1.24; Arg/Arg+Arg/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.70-1.35; Arg/Arg vs. Arg/Pro+Pro/Pro: OR=1.15, 95% CI: 0.91-1.46). Stratified analyses according to ethnicity and quality score of the studies also detected no significant association in any subgroup. Furthermore, no effect of this polymorphism on subtype of skin cancer, such as melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma, was observed. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism may have little involvement in skin cancer susceptibility.",

        "abstract": "Protein kinases have been found to possess two characteristic conformations in their activation-loops: the active DFG-in conformation and the inactive DFG-out conformation. Recently, it has been very interesting to develop type-II inhibitors which target the DFG-out conformation and are more specific than the type-I inhibitors binding to the active DFG-in conformation. However, solving crystal structures of kinases with the DFG-out conformation remains a challenge, and this seriously hampers the application of the structure-based approaches in development of novel type-II inhibitors. To overcome this limitation, here we present a computational approach for predicting the DFG-out inactive conformation using the DFG-in active structures, and develop related conformational selection protocols for the uses of the predicted DFG-out models in the binding pose prediction and virtual screening of type-II ligands. With the DFG-out models, we predicted the binding poses for known type-II inhibitors, and the results were found in good agreement with the X-ray crystal structures. We also tested the abilities of the DFG-out models to recognize their specific type-II inhibitors by screening a database of small molecules. The AUC (area under curve) results indicated that the predicted DFG-out models were selective toward their specific type-II inhibitors. Therefore, the computational approach and protocols presented in this study are very promising for the structure-based design and screening of novel type-II kinase inhibitors.",

This study was undertaken in a myeloma setting to determine whether CRP affects tumor cell growth and survival. We show that CRP enhanced myeloma cell proliferation under stressed conditions and protected myeloma cells from chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. CRP binds activating Fcgamma receptors; activates PI3K/Akt, ERK, and NF-kappaB pathways; and inhibits caspase cascade activation induced by chemotherapy drugs. CRP also enhanced myeloma cell secretion of IL-6 and synergized with IL-6 to protect myeloma cells from chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, our results implicate CRP as a potential target for cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Various edible starch films were prepared via extrusion, with a particular focus on the effects of the amylose content of starches from the same resource (corn) on film processibility and performances. Four corn starches with different amylose contents (4.3–77.4%) were used as model materials. The effects of various extrusion processing conditions, such as temperature, screw speed, feeding rate, and water content were systematically investigated. It was found that, while a higher amylose content increased the difficulty of extrusion processing, this could be overcome by increasing the processing temperature, moisture content, and equilibration time. On the other hand, mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, and microscopy showed that films based on higher amylose starch had better mechanical and thermal properties. The reasons include not only the easy entanglement of long linear amylose chains, but also the retained granular structure in high-amylose films, which may act as self-reinforcement.",

Hydroxypropyl high-amylose starch plasticized by water and glycerol was used in this work. The microstructure and performance of films were investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM), optical microscope (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic mechanical analyzer, tensile testing, drop impact testing and disc diffusion test. Results clearly demonstrated that PGP inhibited the growth of both gram-positive (S. aureus) and gram-negative (Salmonella) bacteria. Meanwhile, PGP also increased Young's modulus, tensile strength and stiffness of the starch-based films. Both OM and SEM observations indicated reasonably good compatibility between starch and PGP particles. The XRD results indicated that PGP retained its semi-crystalline structure in the film, which can be used to explain the mechanism of mechanical reinforcement. Since all the components are food ingredients, so it is expected that the developed material can be used as an edible film and food grade packaging material.",

The SPRYD4 gene is isolated from the human brain cDNA library, and mapped to 12q13.2 by searching the UCSC genomic database. The SPRYD4 cDNA is 1201 base pairs in length and contains an open reading frame encoding 207 amino acids. The SPRYD4 gene consists of two exons and encodes a putative protein with a SPRY domain ranging from 86 to 203 amino acids. The RT-PCR analysis reveals that SPRYD4 is ubiquitously expressed in 18 human tissues. However, it is strongly expressed in kidney, bladder, brain, thymus and stomach, while weakly expressed liver, testis, uterus, spleen and lung. Subcellular localization demonstrates that SPRYD4 protein is localized in the nuclear when overexpressed in COS-7 cell.",

        "abstract": "An oral colon-targeting controlled release system based on resistant starch acetate (RSA) as a film-coating material was developed. The RSA was successfully synthesized, and its digestion resistibility could be improved by increasing the degree of substitution (DS), which was favorable for the colon-targeting purpose. As a delivery carrier material, the characteristics of RSA were investigated by polarized light microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results revealed a decrease of the crystallinity of RSA and a change of its crystalline structure from B + V hydrid type to V type. To evaluate the colon-targeting release performance, the RSA film-coated pellets loaded with different bioactive components were prepared by extrusion-spheronization and then by fluid bed coating. The effects of the DS, plasticizer content, and coating thickness of the RSA film and those of the content and molecular weight of the loaded bioactive component on the colon-targeting release performance of the resulting delivery system were investigated. By adjusting the DS, the coating thickness, and the plasticizer content of the RSA film, either the pellets loaded with a small molecular bioactive component such as 5-aminosalicylic acid or those with a macromolecular bioactive peptide or protein such as bovine serum albumin, hepatocyte growth-promoting factor, or insulin showed a desirable colon-targeting release performance. The release percentage was less than 12% in simulated upper gastrointestinal tract and went up to 70% over a period of 40 h in simulated colonic fluid. This suggests that the delivery system based on RSA film has an excellent colon-targeting release performance and the universality for a wide range of bioactive components.",

        "abstract": "From a microstructural view, the focus of this work was on the water absorption rate of starch-based superabsorbent polymers (starch-SAPs) prepared under high starch concentration (0.27:1w/w starch:water). The effects of starch amylose/amylopectin ratio were disclosed. The increase in amylopectin reduced the amount (C) of polyacrylamide (PAM) in starch-SAPs but increased the ratio of starch carbons grafted with PAM, which eventually decreased the average length (L) of PAM chains. The shorter PAM chains could reduce starch-SAP chain flexibility, thus inducing larger mass fractal gels in swollen starch-SAPs. In general, the increases in C and L were preferable for a higher water absorbent capacity (WAC), whereas the denser fractal gels reduced WAC. Interestingly, all starch-SAPs had a dual-phase absorption process with the first stage showing a higher rate than the second phase (k>k). The shorter PAM chains caused increases in k and k.",

        "abstract": "The testis specific serine/threonine protein kinase family (Tssk) members play important roles in spermatogenesis and/or spermiogenesis. Similar to other Tssk family members, Tssk4 protein shows exclusive expression in testis, but its biochemical and biological functions are still largely unknown. In present work, we generate a polyclonal antibody which specifically recognizes Tssk4 but not the other three Tssk family members (Tssk1, Tssk2 and Tssk3). By using the qualified antibody, we show that Tssk4 protein is constantly expressed in testis from haploid round spermatids to morphological mature spermatozoa. Further experiments reveal that Tssk4 has autophosphorylation activity and self-association character in vitro. Importantly, we find that autophosphorylation of Tssk4 at Thr-197 in the T-loop region is essential to its kinase activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that autophosphorylation at Thr-197 plays a critical role in maintaining Tssk4 kinase activity, which might be involved in spermiogenesis.",

However, FCM is founded with type-1 fuzzy sets, which cannot handle the uncertainties existing in images and algorithm itself. The interval type-2 fuzzy c-means algorithm (IT2FCM) has better performance on handling uncertainties. But for image segmentation, IT2FCM hasn't taken the spatial information of images into account, which makes the segmentation result not ideal enough. In order to incorporate spatial information, an extension of IT2FCM is proposed here. And the result of image segmentation using the proposed algorithm shows that the algorithm has better performance on suppressing noise and better effects on segmenting images compared with FCM-based algorithms and IT2FCM.",

        "abstract": "Babesia orientalis is an obligate intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite of the buffalo (Bubalus bubalis, Linnaeus, 1758) transmitted by the tick Rhipicephalus heamaphysaloides. It is the causative agent of water buffalo babesiosis, one of the most important pathogens of water buffalo in central and southern China. As a member of the phylum Apicomplexa, B. orientalis possesses a relatively independent and alga originated organelle the apicoplast. Apicoplasts in other apicomplexa parasites are involved in the biosynthesis of haem, fatty acids, iron-sulphur clusters and isoprenoids. Some of these metabolic pathways were shown to be essential for parasite survival, therefore can serve as potential drug targets.30 pairs of primers were designed based on the full genome sequence of B. orientalis (unpublished data) and by aligning reported apicoplast genomes of Babesia bovis and Theileria parva. Conventional PCRs was performed to obtain overlapped fragments to cover the whole apicoplast genome. Then the apicoplast genome of B.orientalis was sequenced, assembled and aligned with reported apicoplast genomes of B. bovis and T. parva. The obtained apicoplast genome was annotated by using Artemis and comparing with published apicomplexan apicoplast genomes. The SSU and LSU nucleotide sequences generated were used in a phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood implemented in MAGE 6.0.We have obtained and analyzed the complete genome sequence of the B. orientalis apicoplast. It consisted of a 33.2 kb circular DNA (78.9 % A + T). The apicoplast genome unidirectionally encodes one large and one small subunit ribosomal RNAs, 24 tRNA genes, 4 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase beta subunits (rpoB, rpoC1, rpoC2a and rpoC2b), 17 ribosomal proteins, one EF-Tu elongation factor, 2 Clp protease chaperones, and 14 hypothetical proteins. In addition, it includes two copies of the clpC gene. The structure and organization of the B. orientalis apicoplast genome are most similar to those of the B. bovis apicoplast.This is the first report of the complete sequence of the B. orientalis apicoplast genome. This information should be useful in the development of safe and efficient treatment against buffalo babesiosis.",

        "abstract": "The murine double minute 2 (MDM2) gene encodes a negative regulator of the tumor protein p53. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in MDM2 promoter, SNP309 T>G, has been reported to alter MDM2 protein expression and accelerate tumor formation in humans. Studies investigating the association between the polymorphism and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk reported conflicting results. We performed a meta-analysis to explore the association of this polymorphism and HCC risk.All eligible studies published were searched for in PubMed. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed for the association using fixed- and random-effects models.We identified five case-control studies including 738 cases and 1014 controls for the present meta-analysis. In studies with limited data, we detected significant associations for all genetic models in the overall analysis (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.88-3.36 for GG vs. TT, p <0.001, P(het) = 0.666; OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.35-2.18 for TG vs. TT, p <0.001, P(het) = 0.925; OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.54-2.43 for dominant model TG + GG vs. TT, p <0.001, P(het) = 0.772; OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.39-2.20 for recessive model GG vs. TT + TG, p <0.001, P(het) = 0.656). Moreover, in the subgroup analysis based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls, sample size, and ethnicity, significant associations were observed in most genetic models.This meta-analysis suggests that the MDM2 309 G allele probably acts as an important HCC risk factor. To further confirm our findings, well-designed studies with large sample sizes and representing different ethnicities are required.",

This paper reports on a study of the effects of starch and wood flour (WF) on the thermal stability of PLA using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen atmosphere, and TG-FTIR to investigate the effects of degraded products from the two fillers on the thermal degradation of PLA. Both fillers accelerated decomposition by releasing chemicals, in particular those with polar groups that can act as chain scissors in PLA. The lower decomposition temperature of the starch resulted in lower decomposition temperatures for PLA/starch blends compared to PLA/WF composites. In addition, the smaller particle size of the starch compared to the WF, facilitated greater interfacial contact with the PLA matrix, thus enhancing its function in accelerating decomposition.",

        "abstract": "PurposeBladder carcinoma is the most common urological malignancy in China. Gene mutation may be one of causes of carcinogenesis in the cancer. We therefore investigated the mRNA expression of RTKN gene in clinic malignant bladder carcinoma and explored the relationship between the novel gene and the cancer.MethodsTotal RNA was extracted from 33 surgically resected specimens of bladder carcinoma and 19 specimens of tumor-free bladder tissues. After the optimal reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction condition was established, the mRNA expression levels of the RTKN gene in the lesions and tumor-free bladder tissues were examined semiquantitatively, and the relationships between expression levels of RTKN and clinical pathological features were analyzed.ResultsThe expression of RTKN gene mRNA in 33 human bladder carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in 19 human tumor-free bladder tissues (0.937±0.103 vs. 0.350±0.082). The average ratio of RTKN expression in neoplasms to that in tumor-free bladder tissues was 0.350±0.164. Based on this ratio the 33 patients were divided into three groups: a downregulated expression group ( n=2), an upregulated expression group ( n=22), and an unchanged group ( n=9). Although the χ 2 test demonstrated a statistically nonsignificant differences in RTKN expression between tumor stages Ta, T 1, and T 2 overall in the 33 human bladder carcinoma, the t test showed that there were statistically significant differences between solitary and multiple tumors, between the paired group aged younger or older than 70 years in 27 de novo bladder carcinoma patients, and between the groups with tumor larger or smaller than 2.25 cm 3.ConclusionsThese results suggest that the RTKN gene is involved in bladder carcinogenesis and progression in bladder carcinoma, indicating that RTKN gene could be a molecular target in cancer therapy.",

Although PARylation has been investigated most thoroughly, the function of MARylation is currently largely undefined. Here, we provide evidences that deficiency of PARP10, a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, markedly increased the migration and invasion of tumor cells through regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and PARP10 inhibited tumor metastasis in vivo, which was dependent on its enzyme activity. Mechanistically, we found that PARP10 interacted with and mono-ADP-ribosylated Aurora A, and inhibited its kinase activity, thereby regulating its downstream signaling. Moreover, the expression level of PARP10 was downregulated in intrahepatic metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with its corresponding primary HCC and adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Taken together, our results indicated that PARP10 has an important role in tumor metastasis suppression via negatively regulation of Aurora A activity.",

        "abstract": "The phase transitions of starch granules of cornstarches with different amylose/amylopectin contents (waxy: 0/100; maize: 23/77; Gelose 50: 50/50; Gelose 80: 80/20) were systematically studied under shearless and shear conditions. A microscope with a hot-stage was used to observe phase transition under shearless conditions during heating and isothermally at different temperatures. Phase transition under shear conditions was investigated using a rheoscope – a controlled rate/controlled stress rheometer with a built-in high-resolution video camera. An increase in starch granule diameter, disappearance of birefringence and granule disappearing were used to describe the phase transition. The diameter growth rate and final accretion ratio sequence of starch granules during heating under shearless conditions was waxy > maize > G50 > G80, which correspond with amylose/amylopectin ratio. The growth rate of granular diameter under shear conditions was controlled by two factors: swelling and dissolving. Starch granules were destroyed under shear conditions, but some could still be identified under shearless conditions up to about 100 °C. Granules totally disappeared in a very short time after gelatinization under shear stress conditions. Increased amylose content led to a lower granule diameter growth rate and accretion ratio, and a higher temperature before birefringence disappeared. It was found that the higher the melting temperature of the amylose–lipid complex, the higher the gelatinization temperature, and the amylose detected by differential scanning calorimetry in the high-amylose starches is proposed as an explanation of the results observed by microscope. Keywords Gelatinization Cornstarch Microscope observation Amylose Amylopectin Shear 1 Introduction It is well known that an order–disorder phase transition occurs when starch granules are heated in the presence of water. When sufficient water is present, this transition, referred to as “gelatinization”, results in near-solubilization of the starch ( Donovan, 1979; French, 1984; Lelievre, 1974 ). The concomitant changes of measurable properties such as viscosity, heat uptake, crystallinity and size variation of starch granules, have been used to detect the extent of starch gelatinization. The technologies developed include microscopic observation ( Ghiasi, Hoseney, & Varriano-Marston, 1982; Olkku & Rha, 1978; Tester & Morrison, 1992; Yeh & Li, 1996; Ziegler et al., 1993 ), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) ( Liu, Yu, Xie, & Chen, 2006; Stevens & Elton, 1971; Yu & Christie, 2001 ), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) ( Cameron & Donald, 1993; Cooke & Gidley, 1992; Jenkins et al., 1994 ). Each technology has its advantages and disadvantages. Direct comparison may not have real meaning, since the detected physical parameters are different, but the various results obtained can be used to support each other, especially when studying gelatinization mechanisms. For example, Liu, Lelievre, and Ayoung–Chee (1991) studied starch gelatinization using DSC, X-ray and birefringence measurement. They found that a decrease in crystallinity occurred both before the birefringence of granules started to disappear and after all birefringence was lost. Yeh and Li (1996) studied the swelling of rice starch and reported a coincidental result between microscopic observations and DSC measurements. It should be noted that all of these technologies were used only to detect phase transition under shearless conditions. Variation of viscosity could be used to detect gelatinization under shear conditions. However, previous studies have mainly focused on the viscosity of gelatinized products ( Freeman & Verr, 1972; Zobel, 1984 ). The advantage of microscopy is the ability to directly observe simultaneous granular swelling and crystallinity disappearance. The technical development of digital image analysis makes quantitative microscopy more convenient and accurate. Currently, the combination of a microscope and a high-end rheometer, i.e., the rheoscope, is the only way to directly observe phase transition under shear conditions ( Yu, Kealy, & Chen, 2006 ). Cornstarch has particular attraction for scientific research since multi-endotherms have been detected at different water contents, and different amylose/amylopectin contents have been found in natural resources. In a previous paper ( Liu et al., 2006 ), we reported on the gelatinization of cornstarches with different amylose/amylopectin contents, studied using a DSC with a stainless steel high-pressure pan. It was found that the number of endotherms, and the temperature and enthalpy of gelatinization, depend on the amylose/amylopectin content. However, the DSC thermograms did not explore the detailed progress of the phase transition, such as granular swelling and crystal structure destruction, and the gelatinization detected by DSC was limited under shearless conditions. In this work, cornstarches with different amylose/amylopectin contents (waxy: 0/100; corn: 23/77; Gelose 50: 50/50; Gelose 80: 80/20) were systematically studied under shearless and shear conditions using a microscope with a hot-stage, and a rheoscope. The observed results combined with DSC measurement were used to investigate the mechanism of starch gelatinization under shear and shearless conditions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Cornstarches with different amylose/amylopectin contents were used in the experimental work. Table 1 shows details of the starches studied. Gelose 50 and Gelose 80 had amylose contents of 50% and 80%, respectively. All the starches were commercially available. Most of starches (waxy-1, maize-1, G50, G80) were supplied by Penford (Australia), while waxy-2 and maize-2 were obtained from China. An infra-red heating balance (Model DHS-20) was used to measure moisture content through heating samples to 110 °C for 20 min. 2.2 Microscope with hot-stage A polarization microscope (Axioskop 40 Pol/40 A Pol, ZEISS) equipped with a 35 mm SLA camera was used in the experimental work. A hot-stage (CI94, Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd.) thermosystem was used in combination with the microscope system. In this work the magnification was 500 × (50 × 10). Both normal and polarized light were used to investigate the phase transition of the starches. Suspensions with 0.5% starch were prepared to study their phase transition. A certain mass of a starch sample was weighed then put into a glass vial, followed by the addition of 25 μL of water using a microsyringe. The total moisture content in the suspension was taken as the original moisture content in the starch together with the added water. The starch suspension was sealed between two microscope glass slides using silicon adhesive. Each specimen was heated from room temperature to 105 °C at 2 °C/min. The camera interval timer was set as 30 s so that an image was captured at each 1 °C temperature increase. Each field was photographed under normal and polarized light. The measurement of diameter variations of starch granules during heating or isothermally at a certain temperature was conducted using the Gun Image Manipulation Program. Images were continuously recorded during heating. The diameter of a granule was calculated using a sphere equal in area to the image. The accretion ration of starch swelling is calculated by AR = ( D t − D 0 )/ D 0 , where D 0 and D t represent the diameter of starch granule at initial and at a specific time, respectively. 2.3 Rheoscope A Thermo Haake rheoscope was used in the experimental work to study gelatinization under shear conditions. Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the rheoscope, which comprises a controlled rate/controlled stress rheometer, with a 70 mm diameter 1° polished cone and plate measuring geometry. It also contains a built-in, high-resolution, black and white video camera with a microscope lens and light source. Water at 0.2% w/w of each sample was used as a solvent. The plate and cone were heated to each set temperature, and the cone was allowed to remain in contact with the lower plate during this time to minimize equilibration time when the sample was added. Standard steady shear rheometric experimental techniques were followed to generate a viscosity–time profile, and the camera collected a corresponding image for each of the viscosity data. The suspensions were heated from room temperature to 95 °C at 2 °C/min. If the outer edge of the plate and cone were exposed, the water evaporated significantly when the temperature was above 90 °C (the highest temperature used in the rheoscope experimental work was 95 °C). To mitigate this issue, a small amount of low-viscosity (2 mPa s) silicone oil was pipetted around the exposed edge. The rheoscope images showed no evidence of oil droplets in the samples, and there was no evidence of evaporation during the experiments. 2.4 Differential scanning calorimetry A Perkin-Elmer DSC Diamond-I with an internal coolant (Intercooler 1P) and nitrogen purge gas was used in the experimental work to confirm the gelatinization behaviors. The melting temperature and enthalpies of indium were used for temperature and heat capacity calibration. High-pressure stainless steel pans (PE No. B0182901 with a gold-plated copper seal (PE No. 042-191758) were used to study the thermal behaviors up to 300 °C with high moisture content. The slow heating rate of 2 °C/min was used to match the observations under the microscope with the hot-stage, and to minimize any temperature lag due to the large mass of the samples. 2.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) SEM (Philips X230) was used to investigate the appearance and surface details of the starches, and their internal morphologies. The surfaces of the samples were coated with carbon. A lower voltage of 2 K was used in this part of the experimental work to avoid damaging the surfaces. 3 Results and discussion The phase transition of starches continuously heated under shearless conditions was studied using a microscope with a hot-stage. Variations in granular morphologies and birefringence during heating were recorded automatically every 30 s. Figs. 2 and 3 show some microscope images taken at different temperatures, collected under normal and polarized light, respectively, for different starches heated at 2 °C/min. The images collected at 30 °C represent the initial morphologies of the different starches. It can be seen that all the granules appear as spherule particles and semi-crystalline black crosses under polarized light. The birefringence sequence of the granules was waxy > maize > G50 > G80. The granular size sequence was waxy > maize > G50 > G80. The phase transition observed under microscope was nonlinear and the images in Figs. 2 and 3 mainly represent the variation points. It can be seen that the diameter of granules increased with increasing temperature for all starches, and birefringence of all the starches disappeared with increasing temperature. These behaviors are expected and have been widely reported. It is important to note that the temperatures at which birefringence disappeared and the accretion ratios are significantly different for the different starches, with lower temperatures of birefringence disappearance and higher accretion ratios being recorded for the amylopectin richer starches. Table 2 lists the observed initial and final temperatures of starch granular swelling and birefringence disappearance for different starches, and their final accretion ratio. An important phenomenon is that the final morphologies of the different starches were significantly different. The granules of the waxy and maize starches were destroyed at about 75 and 85 °C, respectively. The granules of G50 and G80 remained as spherule up to 100 °C, which was the maximum experimental temperature. Fig. 4 shows the diameter variation measured during heating of the different starch granules. The growth rates and final accretion ratios for the different starches were significantly different. The granular growth rate was nonlinear and all materials exhibited a sharp shoulder, with the amylopectin richer starches having the narrower shoulders. For example, the diameter of the waxy-1 starch increased only slightly when the temperature was below 70 °C. The growth rate increased sharply in the temperature range of 70–75 °C, then the increase rate slowed significantly. The growth rate of G80 was much smoother and continued to the maximum experimental temperature of 100 °C. These phenomena correspond with other measurement techniques such as DSC ( Liu et al., 2006; Yu & Christie, 2001 ). The sequence of diameter increase rate and final accretion ratio of the starch granules during heating was waxy > maize > G50 > G80 in the temperature range used in this experimental work. The disappearance of birefringence of the starches showed similar patterns, but the initial and final temperatures were different. Generally, the temperature variation range of birefringence was much narrower than that of diameter. The results also indicated that during heating, the loss of crystalline structure occurred at lower temperatures than the loss of molecular order for all starch samples. This was expected, since starch granules continuously swell even after the crystalline structure of the starch granules has been destroyed. Liu et al. (1991) has reported that a decrease in crystallinity occurred both before the birefringence of granules started to disappear and after all birefringence was lost. Fig. 5 shows selected images taken by the rheoscope during heating (2 °C/min) under shear stress for different starches. It can be seen that the particles of the waxy and maize starches remained intact up to about 75 °C, and that above this temperature, they were completely destroyed and disappeared in a narrow temperature range. The granules of the amylose-rich starch G80 remained spherule at the highest experiment temperature of about 100 °C. It should be noted that the granular growth rates and final accretion ratios under shear stress were lower than those under shearless conditions for the amylopectin-rich starches (see Tables 2 and 3 ) but the final accretion ratio of G80 is higher. An explanation for this is that as the starch granules increased in size, the outside layer of the starch particles dissolved in water due to shear stress. One important effect observed by comparing successive images during the experiments, was that all of the starch systems tested displayed a distinct process of dissolution. At first the particle size increased due to the ingress of moisture through the amorphous region. This swelling was accompanied by a reduction in the disparity or definition of the granular epidermis, which one would intuitively suspect to be due to stretching caused by expansion and softening as a result of the elevated temperature. These phenomena are followed by partial or complete dissolution during particle swelling. Some cloudiness was observed around the starch particles in the suspension before total dissolution, which was attributed to the dissolved parts of the starch particles. The starch G80 has not fully swelled at the highest temperature and the granules have not started to dissolve in this experimental work under both shearless and shear conditions. The shear stress enhanced the swelling resulting in the higher of final accretion ratio. Fig. 6 shows the gelatinization endotherms of various starches measured by DSC. It can be seen that the waxy and maize starches exhibited a large gelatinization endotherm at about 70 °C. This endotherm has been well accepted as representing the gelatinization of amylopectin, and is labeled “G” in Fig. 6 ( Donovan, 1979; Evans & Haisman, 1982; Liu et al., 2006; Russel, 1987; Zobel, 1984 ). Apart from the G endotherm, a second endotherm was detected for maize starch at about 90 °C, and this has been recognized as the phase transition within an amylose–lipid complex, and is labeled “M2” in Fig. 6 ( Biliaderis, Page, Slade, & Sirett, 1985; Jovanovich & Añón, 1999; Liu et al., 2006; Raphaelides & Karkalas, 1988 ). The thermal transitions of the high-amylose content starches (G50 and G80) were not as sharp as those of the normal and amylopectin-rich starches; instead very broad endotherms were obtained in the temperature range of 65–115 °C. This broad peak is a composite of gelatinization G and a phase transition M2. Apart from this broad endotherm, a small endotherm was also detected at about 155 °C for G80 (labeled “M3”), which is considered as the melting temperature of amylase ( Liu et al., 2006 ). The DSC results can be used to explain the phenomena observed under the microscope, even though the measurement conditions were different. The lower gelatinization temperature of the amylopectin-rich starches detected by DSC corresponded with a lower temperature of birefringence disappearance and a faster growth rate of starch granules. The broader endotherm of amylose-rich starches detected by DSC corresponded with the broader temperature range of birefringence disappearance observed under the microscope (see Fig. 3 ). The amylase for G80 at 155 °C can be used to explain why it remained undissolved. 4 Conclusions The phase transition of granules of cornstarch with different amylose/amylopectin contents (waxy: 0/100; maize: 23/77; Gelose 50: 50/50; Gelose 80: 80/20) were systematically studied under shearless and shear conditions. The phase transition of starch granules under shear stress conditions was observed for the first time. The growth in starch granule diameter and the disappearance of birefringence and particle were used to describe the phase transition. The diameter growth rate and final accretion ratio sequence of starch granules during heating under shearless conditions was waxy > maize > G50 > G80 in the temperature range used in this experimental work. The disappearance of birefringence showed a similar variation pattern, but the initial and final temperatures were different. Generally, the temperature variation range of birefringence disappearance was much narrower than that of diameter growth rate. The results also indicated that during heating, loss of crystalline structure occurred at lower temperatures than loss of molecular order for all starch samples. The growth rate of granular diameter under shear conditions was controlled by two factors: swelling and dissolving. Starch granules were destroyed under shear conditions, but some could still be identified under shearless conditions up to about 100 °C. The granules totally disappeared in a very short time after gelatinization under shear stress conditions. It was found that the higher the gelatinization temperature, the higher the melting temperature of the amylose–lipid complex, and the amylose detected by DSC in the high-amylose starch is proposed as an explanation for the results observed by microscope.

The net photosynthetic rate obviously decreased under UV-C radiation and the inhibition increased as the increasing of radiation time. The net photosynthetic rate under the active photosynthetic radiation of 1 600 μmol ·m-2·s-1 was lower than that of 800 μmol·m-2·s-1 .The increasing of CO2 concentration could enhance the net photosynthetic rate after UV-C radiation. The simulating analysis by logistic equation showed that the maximal net photosynthetic rate decreased with the radiation time of UV-C when the CO2 concentration increased and the maximum of net photosynthetic rate decreased under high active photosynthetic radiation. UV-C radiation led to the decreasing of stomatic conductivity and correlation value was low between CO2 concentration and stomatic conductivity. Evaporation rate had the same tendency with stomatic conductivity.",

A novel model based on interval self-organizing map(ISOM) whose weights are interval numbers presented in this paper differ from conventional SOM approach. Correspondingly, a new competition algorithm based on gradient descent algorithm is proposed according to a different criterion function defined in this paper, and the convergence of the new algorithm is proved. To improve the robustness of inverse control system, the inverse controller is approximated by ISOM which is cascaded with the original to capture composite pseudo-linear system. Simulation results show that the inverse system has superior performance of tracking precision and robustness.",

        "abstract": "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered potential markers of cancer risk and prognosis in various cancers. In the current study, the primary aim is to determine whether the miR-492G>C polymorphism (rs2289030) altered hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. The SNP rs2289030 of miR-492 was genotyped using DNA from blood samples of 362 HCC patients that had undergone surgical resection of a HCC tumor. The associations between overall survival and demographic characteristics, clinical features, and the SNP rs2289030 were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results showed that patients who carried the CG genotype (P \n                        = 0.015, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.704, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.530–0.934) and CG+GG genotype (P = 0.011, HR = 0.703, 95 % CI 0.536–0.924) had significantly decreased risk of death compared to those with the CC genotype. Similar results were found in the multivariate analysis adjusted by tumor size and venous invasion. Further stratification analysis indicated that the effect of rs2289030 had more prominence in patients ≤50 years old and that reported ever using alcohol, male gender, a family history of HCC, being HbsAg or alpha fetoprotein (AFP) positive, differentiation I + II, presence of venous invasion or cirrhosis, multiple tumors, and pTNM stage I + II. Results from this study illustrate the potential use of miR-492 rs2289030 as a prognostic marker for HCC patients that have undergone a surgical resection of the tumor.",

        "abstract": "Progesterone induces proliferation of breast cancer cells and contributes to the development of breast cancer. The effects of progesterone are mediated by progesterone receptors (PRs). However, it is still not fully understood how the proliferative effects of PR is regulated in vivo. Increasing amount of evidence strongly suggests that dysregulation of ubiquitin-proteasome system is closely associated with cancer pathogenesis. Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is an adaptor protein of the CUL3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. SPOP represents one of the highest loci for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in breast cancer. SPOP downregulation contributes to breast cancer cell growth and invasion. In this study, we revealed PR as a bona fide substrate for SPOP. SPOP interacts with PR in vivo and targets PR for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Moreover, SPOP suppresses progesteroneinduced PR transactivation, S phase entry, and Erk1/2 activation. Our study revealed novel molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of PR protein homeostasis in breast cancer cells, and provided insights in understanding the relationship between SPOP inactivation and the development of breast cancer.

The sequence analysis of the PCR product identified a novel zinc finger gene fragment, HGZA-1. Using HGZA-1 as a probe to screen cDNA library the full-length cDNA of a novel human zinc finger gene ZNF191 has been cloned. The computer analysis of the cDNA sequence reveals an open reading frame coding potentially for a zinc finger protein with 4 tandemly repeated C2H2 zinc finger motifs at C-terminus. This putative protein consists of 368 aa and has a molecular weight of 43 ku approximately. Hybridization of human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ hybridization mapped this gene to chromosome 18q12.1. Northern blot analysis revealed that this gene is expressed ubiquitously, while its expression level in liver is much higher than in other tissues.",

Alkali treatment disrupted the amorphous matrix, and partial lamellae and crystallites, which weakened starch molecular packing and eventually enhanced the susceptibility of starch to alkali. Stronger alkali treatment (0.5% w/w) made this effect more prominent and even transformed the dual-phase digestion of starch into a triple-phase pattern. Compared with high-amylose starch, regular maize starch, which possesses some unique structure characteristics typically as pores and crystallite weak points, showed evident changes of hierarchical structure and in digestion rate. Thus, alkali treatment has been demonstrated as a simple method to modulate starch hierarchical structure and thus to realize the rational development of starch-based food products with desired digestibility.",

        "abstract": "5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a major regulator of cellular ATP levels and protects cells against stresses that cause ATP depletion. AMPK is a protein heterotrimer composed of a catalytic alpha subunit and two regulatory subunits, beta and gamma. In the present study, a homologue of the AMPK gamma1-subunit cDNA with an open reading frame encoding 328 amino acids was identified. The putative protein sequence is about 76% identical to the 331-amino-acid gamma1 subunit and also has four consecutive cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) domains, a characteristic structure of AMPK gamma subunits from various species. This cDNA (tentatively termed PRKAG2-b) is identical to a recently reported cDNA (tentatively termed PRKAG2-a) of human AMPK gamma subunits except in their 5'-end regions, suggesting that these two cDNAs are two different transcripts of the same gene. To determine the expression pattern of the gene, two probes, one from the 3'-UTR of PRKAG2-b and the other from the 5'- unique region of PRKAG2-a, were used to hybridize MTN membranes. Three transcripts (3.8, 3.0, and 2.4 kb) were observed when the first probe was used, whereas only 3.8- and 3.0-kb transcripts were seen when the second probe was used. Thus, the PRKAG2-b corresponded to the 2.4-kb transcript, which is ubiquitously expressed except in liver and thymus. The highest level was detected in heart, while abundant expression also existed in placenta and testis. The expression pattern of PRKAG2-b is completely different from those of PRKAG2-a and PRKAG1, whose expression patterns were also determined in the current study. The PRKAG2 gene was located to human chromosome 7q36 between markers D7S2439 and D7S2462 by radiation hybrid mapping. The genomic organization of PRKAG2-b was identified by comparing its cDNA sequence with two genomic sequences AC006358 and AC006966, which showed that PRKAG2-b spanned an approximately 80-kb region and was composed of 12 exons.",

The diagnostic and prognostic values of the MCM genes were investigated by using the data of HCC patients from the GSE14520 and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. : Bioinformatics analysis of the MCM genes substantiated that MCM2-7 genes were significantly enriched in DNA replication and cell cycle, and co-expressed with each other. These genes also co-expressed in HCC tumor tissue in both the GSE14520 and TCGA cohort. We also observed that the expression of the MCM2-7 genes was increased in tumor tissue, and diagnostic receiver operating characteristic analysis of MCM2-7 indicated that these genes could serve as sensitive diagnostic markers in HCC. Survival analysis in the GSE14520 cohort suggested that expression of  and  were significantly associated with hepatitis B virus-related HCC overall survival (OS). However, none of the MCM genes were associated with recurrence-free survival in the GSE14520 cohort. The validation cohort of TCGA suggested that the expression of  and  were significantly correlated with HCC OS. : Our study indicated that MCM2-7 genes may be potential diagnostic biomarkers in patients with HCC.

        "abstract": "The X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 3 (XRCC3) gene is a member of the RAD51 gene family. It encodes an important protein that functions in the homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand break. In this study, our aim was to explore the relationship between XRCC3 T241M polymorphism and gastric cancer risk. Performing both the overall meta-analysis and subgroup meta-analysis based on ethnicity, source of controls, and cancer location with a total of 6 eligible studies (1,154 cases and 1,487 controls in all), we detected no significant gastric cancer risk variation for all genetic models in the overall analysis and in the subgroup analysis based on cancer location. What is interesting is in the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, where significantly decreased gastric cancer risk was observed for recessive model in Asians (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.50-0.95), while significantly increased gastric cancer risk was detected for dominant model in Caucasians (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.01-2.08). In summary, according to the results of our meta-analysis, the XRCC3 T241M polymorphism might influence gastric cancer risk oppositely in Asians and Caucasians. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

It is possible to construct an EAQECC from any classical linear code, unlike standard quantum error-correcting codes, which can only be constructed from dual-containing codes. However, the parameter of ebits $c$ is usually calculated by computer search. In this paper, we construct four classes of MDS entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (MDS EAQECCs) based on $k$-Galois LCD MDS codes for some certain code lengths, where the parameter of ebits $c$ can be easily generated algebraically and not by computational search. Moreover, the constructed four classes of EAQECCs are also maximal-entanglement EAQECCs.",

        "abstract": "Death-associated protein kinase (DAPk) family has emerged as a novel subfamily of pro-apoptotic serine/threonine kinase in the last 10 years. Although the functions of DAPk have been well documented, those of other family members remain uncertain. In this work, we characterized the expression pattern of human DAPk like kinase/Zipper interacting protein kinase (Dlk/ZIP kinase) in cancer specimens and cell lines. Dlk expression level was significantly down-regulated in cervical carcinoma cells compared to the surrounding non-tumorous tissues. Overexpression of Dlk led to cell morphological changes, suppressed colony formation and elevated cell apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Both the kinase activity and the cytoplasmic localization were required for its pro-apoptotic tendency. Mechanism exploration revealed that upon serum deprivation, Dlk overexpression could sensitize cells to apoptosis while overexpression of the kinase inactive mutant (Dlk-K42A) was able to rescue apoptotic cell death. Our data thus implicates that Dlk plays a positive role in modulating death-related signaling pathways. Reconstitution of Dlk expression might bring a potential therapeutic approach to cervical carcinoma treatments.",

In this paper, a new plasticity model was developed to simulate the keying behavior of SEPLAs. The model was based on three groups of yield envelopes, which considered three different states between the flap and the main plate. Thus, the plasticity model can consider the flap rotation relative to the fluke. The anchor shank was also considered to investigate the three dimensional (3D) effects of the actual SEPLA shape when deriving the yield envelops. A three dimensional large deformation finite element (3D-LDFE) model with flap rotation and shank considered was also set up. Then 3D-LDFE analysis was carried out to verify the plasticity model. The results given by 3D-LDFE analyses agree well with those by plasticity analyses. The effects of the flap on the embedment loss and pullout capacity, and the effects of loading eccentricity and pullout angle on diving behavior are investigated. Optimal padeye offset and pullout angle to drive the anchor diving are proposed.",

A chromosome 14q24.3 band-specific single copy DNA pool was constructed based on this probe pool. Using total DNA of the pool as probe to hybridize the human marrow cDNA library, 68 primary positive clones were selected from 5 x 10(5) cDNA clones. Among these primary clones, 32 secondary clones were obtained after second-round screening and designed as cFD14-1-32. Finally, 24 band-specific expression fragments were identified from these 32 positive clones by DNA hybridization. Those band-specific clones can hybridize to both 14q24.3 DNA and human genomic DNA but can't hybridize to 17q11-12 DNA. Partial sequences of 13 fragments of them were sequenced and identified as novel cDNA sequences, and these sequences were proved to have some homology with known genes in NCBI database. Analysis of expression spectrum of cFD14-1 suggested that the cDNA fragments thus obtained should be used to isolate the genes can not been cloned in 14q24.3 region.",

        "title": "Molecular cloning and characterization of rat LC3A and LC3B--two novel markers of autophagosome.",
        "abstract": "Rat microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) is a homologue of yeast Atg8, an essential component of autophagy. Following synthesis, the C-terminus of rat LC3 is cleaved by a cysteine protease-Atg4, to produce LC3-I, which is located in cytosolic fraction. LC3-I can be converted to LC3-II through the processing by Atg7 (E1-like enzyme) and Atg3 (E2-like enzyme). LC3-II is modified by phosphatidylethanolamine on C-terminus and binds tightly to autophagosomal membrane. Here we reported the cloning of two novel variants of rat LC3, named LC3A and LC3B, respectively, and LC3B is an alternative splicing variant of LC3. LC3A, LC3B, and LC3 showed different expression patterns in rat tissues, suggesting a functional divergence among these proteins. When LC3A and LC3B were overexpressed, both exhibited two forms (18 and 16 kDa, representing types of I and II, separately), which might be due to post-translational modification including the characteristic C-terminal cleavage at these two proteins as similar to that found in rat LC3 and yeast Atg8. Subcellular localization demonstrated that both LC3A and LC3B are colocalized with LC3 and associated with the autophagic membranes. Mutation analysis further revealed that the conserved Gly120 residues of LC3A and LC3B are essential for their characteristic C-terminal cleavage and localization to autophagic membranes. Present data suggested that LC3A and LC3B could also be used as two novel autophagosomal markers.",

        "abstract": "CUTA, Homo sapiens divalent cation tolerance homolog, has been implicated in anchoring of acetylcholinesterase in neuronal cell membranes. However, a protein highly homologous to CUTA in Rattus norvegicus is structurally similar to the signal transduction protein PII, and this similarity suggests an intriguing role of CUTA in signal transduction. Recent researches indicated that CUTA was one of the 35 key genes responsible for lactation in mammary gland development. However, the physiological role of CUTA is still unclear, so more information of this gene is needed. In this study, the expression profile of CUTA gene in human tissues was examined, and our research revealed that CUTA gene was constitutively expressed in all of the 18 tissues tested. As reported, CUTA gene has five variant transcripts encoding three isoforms with different N terminals. CUTA isoform2 is encoded by three of the five variant transcripts as the common part of the three isoforms. So CUTA isoform2 was chose as representative to characterize the CUTA protein. We constructed a HeLa cell line stably transfected with the encoding sequence of CUTA isoform2 for further study. The subcellular location and oligomeric structure of the CUTA isoform2 was analyzed in the stable cell lines. It was found that the CUTA isoform2 was mainly located in mitochondria as a new potential mitochondrial protein. Furthermore, CUTA isoform2 formed trimers in cell lysate with the possible occurrence of heteropolymers. These findings would be helpful to the further study on the specific function of CUTA protein.",

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel human LU domain containing gene, LYPD6, isolated from human testis cDNA library, and mapped to 2q23.1-23.2 by searching the UCSC genomic database. The LYPD6 cDNA sequence of 3,501 base pairs contains an open reading frame encoding 171 amino acids. Subcellular localization of LYPD6 demonstrated that the protein was localized in the cytoplasm when overexpressed in COS-7 cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that LYPD6 was widely expressed in human tissues and the expression levels in brain and heart were relatively high. Furthermore, the subsequent analysis based on reporter gene assays suggested that overexpression of LYPD6 in HEK 293T cells was able to suppress the transcriptional activities of AP1.",

        "abstract": "Studies investigating the relationship between TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and endometrial cancer risk reported conflicting results. To explore a more precise estimate of the effect of this polymorphism on endometrial carcinogenesis, a meta-analysis was performed by searching eligible studies in PubMed. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association for codominant model (Arg/Arg vs. Pro/Pro, Arg/Pro vs. Pro/Pro), dominant model (Arg/Arg+Arg/Pro vs. Pro/Pro), and recessive model (Arg/Arg vs. Arg/Pro+Pro/Pro), respectively. Subgroup analyses were performed by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls, the specimen of cases for determining TP53 genotypes, sample size, the source of control and case groups, and ethnicity. We identified 8 case-control studies involving 2,154 subjects for this meta-analysis. Overall, no evidence of association was observed between TP53 genotypes and endometrial cancer risk in all genetic models (Arg/Arg vs. Pro/Pro: OR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.69-1.39, P=0.90; Arg/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.71-1.42, P=0.98; dominant model: OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.71-1.38, P=0.95; recessive model: OR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.80-1.41, P=0.95). Stratified analyses also detected no significant association in any subgroup, except among those studies with controls deviated from HWE in recessive model (OR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.07-2.39). In conclusion, we did not observe any evidence for a role of TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism in endometrial cancer. The reported significant association between this polymorphism and endometrial cancer risk may be due to methodological errors such as selection bias, small sample size, Type I error, and population stratification.",

Based on support vector regression with presented kernel, a learning algorithm consisting of two phases is developed to construct fuzzy system. In the first phase, the support vector regression learning model provides architecture to extract support vectors for generating fuzzy rules, and then characterizes the support vector expansion in TS fuzzy inference procedure through simple equivalent transform. In the second phase, a reduced set method is employed to simplify the obtained fuzzy model, and a bottom-up strategy with relative degree of sharing is suggested to obtain a transparent rule base, at the same time preserves the accuracy and generalization performance of the fuzzy model. Finally, the performance of the proposed fuzzy model is compared with hierarchical clustering based on using a self-organizing network modeling methods.",

        "abstract": "Studies investigating the relationship between TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and endometrial cancer risk reported conflicting results. To explore a more precise estimate of the\n effect of this polymorphism on endometrial carcinogenesis, a meta-analysis was performed by searching eligible studies in\n PubMed. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association for codominant model\n (Arg/Arg vs. Pro/Pro, Arg/Pro vs. Pro/Pro), dominant model (Arg/Arg + Arg/Pro vs. Pro/Pro), and recessive model (Arg/Arg vs.\n Arg/Pro + Pro/Pro), respectively. Subgroup analyses were performed by Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls, the specimen\n of cases for determining TP53 genotypes, sample size, the source of control and case groups, and ethnicity. We identified 8 case–control studies involving\n 2,154 subjects for this meta-analysis. Overall, no evidence of association was observed between TP53 genotypes and endometrial cancer risk in all genetic models (Arg/Arg vs. Pro/Pro: OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.69–1.39, P = 0.90; Arg/Pro vs. Pro/Pro: OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.71–1.42, P = 0.98; dominant model: OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.71–1.38, P = 0.95; recessive model: OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.80–1.41, P = 0.95). Stratified analyses also detected no significant association in any subgroup, except among those studies with controls\n deviated from HWE in recessive model (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.07–2.39). In conclusion, we did not observe any evidence for a\n role of TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism in endometrial cancer. The reported significant association between this polymorphism and endometrial\n cancer risk may be due to methodological errors such as selection bias, small sample size, Type I error, and population stratification.",

        "abstract": "Here we report the use of a one-step process of reactive melt mixing to prepare starch-based superabsorbent polymers (SBSAPs) for the slow release of urea as a fertilizer. A modified twin-rotor mixer, with improved sealing to establish an oxygen-free environment, was used to study the chemical and physical reactions during the melt-processing through monitoring the temperature and torque. The effects of the initiator (ceric ammonium nitrate, or CAN), crosslinker (N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide, or N,N′-MBA) and saponification agent (NaOH) under different reaction conditions (time, temperature, and shear intensity) were systematically studied. Also investigated was the effect of starch with different amylose content. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed that using this simple technique, SBSAPs were successfully prepared from either high-amylopectin starch (waxy corn starch) or high-amylose starch (Gelose 50) grafted with AM and crosslinked by N,N′-MBA. Gel strength was evaluated by rheometry, which revealed a significant increase in storage modulus (G′) obtained in the crosslinked high-amylose SBSAP gels. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed a more sophisticated structural network with a smaller pore size in the crosslinked high-amylose gels. Urea as a fertilizer was embedded in the SBSAP gel network, and this network controlled the urea release in water. The release rate of urea depended on the gel strength, gel microstructure and water absorption capacity (WAC) of SAP, which was affected by the reaction conditions and degree of saponification.",

There are 25 Hd fragments corresponding to cDNA 9-14 in DMD gene. Since then, the exact length and the new order of Hd fragments are established. A new 2.1 kb fragment (Hd 55) is revealed; a 5.2 kb fragment (formerly designated as Hd 59) is excluded and the existence of a controversial 3.2 kb fragment (Hd 64) is confirmed. Besides, three new exons were revealed by comparing the PvuII and the XbaI hybridization patterns with the HindIII hybridization patterns for these cDNA subprobes. It is concluded that there are at least 66 Hd fragments, or 79 exons in DMD gene basing on the discovery of three additional exons. The corresponding relationship between the 66 Hd fragments and the SfiI large scale physical map has been studied, and at least 17 Hd fragments or 19 exons were shown to be distributed in the last fragment (IJ fragment) of the SfiI map of DMD gene.",

It was found that both rheological properties in solution and gel behaviors in hydrogel of the blends depended on polymer/solvent concentration, HPMC/HPS ratio, and temperature. At higher temperature, all the blending samples showed hydrogel behavior, while at lower temperature, the suspensions with higher HPS ratio displayed hydrogel-like behavior but the gels were able to be destroyed at higher frequencies. With an increase of the HPS ratio, the fluid behavior index deceases, meaning the solution shows more obvious pseudoplastic behavior. However, the fluid consistency index increases, meaning that viscosity increases with increase of HPS content. The strength of HPMC gel was weakened by additional of HPS at higher temperature, while the HPS gel was weakened by addition of HPMC at lower temperatures. Viscosities of both HPMC and HPS were balanced by the blending at different temperatures since one is thermal and other is cool gel, which improves the processability for many applications.",

Allelic fragments were detected in hybridization patterns of PvuII/la, Taq I /2b-3, Taq I/5b-7, arid Xba l /10. Among them, the allelic fragments (26kb and 3.8kb) in PvuII/2b-3 pattern and the allelic fragments (10.0kb and 8.4kb) in Taq I/5b-7 patterns had never been reported previously. Compared with the data from Caucasians and Japanese, it indicated that there was a significant difference (P<0.01) of the allelic fragment frequency in Taq I/2b-3 and Xba I/10 patterns between Chinese and Caucasians. The frequencies of allelic fragments A2 (5.6kb) in Taq I/8 and A2 (10.7kb) in EcoR V/9 were high in Caucasians, yet had not been detected in Chinese, the differences were also highly significant. But in Chinese and Caucasians, the B1B2 allelic frequencies in Taq I/5b-7 are the same. As to the frequency of the allelic fragments A1A2 and B1B2 in Pvu II/la, there was no significant difference between Chinese and Japanese.",

However, the association between CYP2C subfamily members and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study investigated the prognostic value of CYP2C subfamily gene expression levels with HCC prognosis. Data of 360 HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas database and 231 in the Gene Expression Omnibus database were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox regression model were used to ascertain overall survival and recurrence-free survival, and to calculate median survival time using hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). In TCGA database, low expression of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in tumor tissue was associated with a short median survival time (all crude P = 0.001, adjusted P = 0.004, P = 0.047, and P = 0.020, respectively). In TCGA database, joint effects analysis of the combinations of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 revealed that high expression of two genes (group 4; group IV, group d) was associated with a reduced risk of death as compared to low expression (group 1, group I, and group a) (adjusted P = 0.005, P = 0.013, and P = 0.016, respectively). In TCGA database, joint effects analysis of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 showed that the risk of death from HCC was lower for groups C and D than for group A (adjusted P = 0.012 and P = 0.008, respectively). CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 gene expression levels are potential prognostic markers of HCC following hepatectomy.",

This work focused on the effects of the amylose/amylopectin ratio of starches from the same source (corn) on the grafting reactions and performance of the resultant starch-based SAPs. To characterise each SAP, the acrylamide groups grafted onto the starch were detected by FTIR; grafting ratio and grafting efficiency were evaluated by a gravimetric method; and graft position and the length of the grafted segment were investigated by NMR. The relationships between the microstructures of the starches, and the graft reactions and performance of the SAPs were studied based on the amylose content in the starches. It was found that under the same reaction conditions, the grafting ratio and efficiency increased with increasing amylose content, which corresponds with water absorption ratio. NMR results indicated that the acrylamide group mainly grafted onto C6, and that the length of the grafted segment decreased with increasing amylopectin content in general, and in particular for waxy starch. The high molecular weight and branched structure of amylopectin reduced the mobility of the polymer chains and increased viscosity, which could explain the graft reactions and performance of the starch-based SAPs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the commonest kind of malignant tumors, which accounts for more than 500,000 cases of newly diagnosed cancer annually. Many microarray studies for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCC have been conducted, but results have varied across different studies. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of publicly available microarray Gene Expression Omnibus datasets, which covers five independent studies, containing 753 HCC samples and 638 non-tumor liver samples. We identified 192 DEGs that were consistently up-regulated in HCC vs. normal liver tissue. For the 192 up-regulated genes, we performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. To our surprise, besides several cell growth-related pathways, spliceosome pathway was also up-regulated in HCC. For further exploring the relationship between spliceosome pathway and HCC, we investigated the expression data of spliceosome pathway genes in 15 independent studies in Nextbio database ( https://www.nextbio.com/b/nextbioCorp.nb ). It was found that many genes of spliceosome pathway such as HSPA1A, SNRPE, SF3B2, SF3B4 and TRA2A genes which we identified to be up-regulated in our meta-analysis were generally overexpressed in HCC. At last, using real-time PCR, we also found that BUD31, SF3B2, SF3B4, SNRPE, SPINK1, TPA2A and HSPA1A genes are significantly up-regulated in clinical HCC samples when compared to the corresponding non-tumorous liver tissues. Our study for the first time indicates that many genes of spliceosome pathway are up-regulated in HCC. This finding might put new insights for people's understanding about the relationship of spliceosome pathway and HCC.",

The high temperature endotherm M1r developed significantly within 2-5 h, while the retrograded endotherm Gr appeared after 5 h storage and increased with time. The single endotherm Gr was separated using an analytical software, and the enthalpy was found to be ∼36% of the total enthalpy of the retrograded starch. Compared to normal cornstarch (∼77% amylopectin content), the final retrogradation ratio of the waxy cornstarch was higher. Both the waxy and normal cornstarches investigated showed a similar pattern of retrogradation process, which developed quickly in the initial stage (up to 1 day) and then gradually came to a near-constant value in the second stage (from 1 to 20 days). © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "The effect of pro-degradant distribution in polyethylene (PE)/starch blends on ultraviolet (UV) photo-oxidative degradation was investigated. Two kinds of pro-degradants, Fe and Co-based, were used in this study. The distribution of pro-degradants in the different phases was varied by a dual step process using a side-feed on a reactive extruder. The variation in mechanical properties and evaluation of carbonyl groups by FTIR were conducted to investigate the effect of degradation following exposure to UV photo-oxidative degradation. It was found that the variation in mechanical properties was higher when the pro-degradants were distributed in the PE phase. The concentration of carbonyl groups increased as a function of UV exposure, and the concentration of carbonyl groups was higher when the pro-degradants were distributed in the PE phase. Micro-cracking was observed on the interface between starch and PE after adding the pro-degradants. When the pro-degradants were distributed in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) phase, the micro-cracks mainly appeared in HDPE matrix, and the density of micro-crack was higher. In general, the function of the pro-degradants in PE/starch blends was enhanced when their distribution was varied within HDPE phase. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

How to further enhance oil recovery after polymer flooding becomes an important question that needs to be solved to stabilize oil production. Branched-preformed particle gel (B-PPG) is a newly developed chemical agent to enhance the oil recovery from heterogeneous reservoirs. Here, laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the enhanced oil recovery of B-PPG/hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) mixed solutions through heterogeneous porous media by the core flood test. The results show that the B-PPG/HPAM mixed solutions have a higher oil recovery than solutions containing HPAM or B-PPG alone because of the synergistic effect between B-PPG and HPAM. B-PPG can adjust flows in different permeability zones by its properties of blocking, deforming, and passing through the throat during flow, which can be proved by the fractional flow behaviors in the parallel-sandpack displacement test.

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is closely involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tumor suppressor p53 was reported to induce HBx degradation and repress its oncogenic function recently, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we attempted to identify the underlying mechanism. We found that overexpression of p53 protein reduces the level of HBx protein and shortens its half-life, however, in MDM2 knock out cells, p53 has no effects on degradation of HBx, meanwhile, overexpression of MDM2 in absence of p53 can accelerate turnover of HBx protein. These indicate that p53-mediated HBx degradation is MDM2-dependent. MDM2 interacts with HBx in vitro and in vivo but does not promote its ubiquitination. In consistent with the results above, HCC tissue samples with wild-type p53 hardly detect HBx protein, whereas, HBx always accumulate in the tissues with mutant p53. Our data provide a possible mechanism on how p53 regulate HBx stability and also a new clue for the study of p53 mutation and HCC development.",

        "abstract": "Activation of β-catenin, the central effector of the canonical wingless-type (Wnt) pathway, has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the transcription regulation mechanism of the β-catenin gene in HCC remains unknown. Here we report that human zinc finger protein 191 (ZNF191) is a potential regulator of β-catenin transcription. ZNF191, a Krüppel-like protein, specifically interacts with the TCAT motif, which constitutes the HUMTH01 microsatellite in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene ex vivo. We demonstrate that ZNF191 is significantly overexpressed in human HCC specimens and is associated with growth of human HCC cells. Global profiling of gene expression in ZNF191 knockdown human hepatic L02 cells revealed that the important Wnt signal pathway genes β-catenin and cyclin D1 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are significantly down-regulated. In agreement with transcription level, β-catenin and cyclin D1 proteins are also down-regulated in transient and stable ZNF191 knockdown L02 and hepatoma Hep3B cell lines. Moreover, significant correlation between ZNF191 and β-catenin mRNA expression was detected in human HCCs. Promoter luciferase assay indicated that ZNF191 can increase transcription activity of the full-length β-catenin (CTNNB1) promoter, and nucleotide (nt)-1407/-907 of the CTNNB1 promoter exhibited the maximum transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that purified ZNF191 protein can directly bind to the CTNNB1 promoter, and the binding region is located at nt-1254/-1224. Finally, we demonstrate that the key binding sequence of ZNF191 in vivo is ATTAATT.ZNF191 can directly bind to the CTNNB1 promoter and activate the expression of β-catenin and its downstream target genes such as cyclin D1 in hepatoma cell lines. This study uncovers a new molecular mechanism of transcription regulation of the β-catenin gene in HCC.",

Emulsification tests were first conducted to screen suitable emulsifiers. Then stability test, droplet size distribution analysis, and rheological property measurements were carried out to investigate the physicochemical characteristics of the developed O/W emulsions. It was found that surfactants of Span 60 and Tween 80 combined with sodium hydroxide could reduce the oil/water interfacial tension and thereby emulsify the heavy crude oil in formation brine. A series of sandpack flow tests were conducted to evaluate the plugging performance of the heavy O/W emulsions, emulsified using 0.1 wt% Span 60–0.1 wt% Tween 80–0.025 wt% NaOH. The flow test results showed that heavy O/W emulsion can result in more than 99% permeability reductions in sandpacks. The permeability reduction by emulsion plugging increased greatly with an increase in oil quality and injected emulsion slug, but decreased with an increase in sandpack permeability and injection flow rate.",

A full disruption and dissolution of starch granules was completed in 10 h at room temperature in pure DMSO, which was faster and more effective than that in ionic liquid 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AMIMCl). When dispersed in DMSO/water and AMIMCl/water at various ratios, respectively, different phase transitions were clearly exhibited, and the appearance and crystal structure of starch granules were significantly damaged with an increase in the concentration. Basing on the study of the decomposition temperature change through TGA measurements, a decreased temperature was observed in both DMSO and AMIMCl system, meaning starch degradation occurred with different levels. The huge temperature change from 357 to 328 °C were found in AMIMCl system, which most likely induced the distinct exothermic phenomenon in the DSC observation due to a significant depolymerization of starch.",

        "abstract": "Several protein kinases have been shown to be involved in spermatogenesis. Recently, a novel subfamily of serine/threonine kinases has been isolated whose expression is limited to testis. Here, we report the fifth family member, named TSSK5, which encodes a 328 amino acid protein. RT-PCR analysis showed that TSSK5 is exclusively expressed in human testis. We isolated cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), a TSSK5 interacting protein via yeast two-hybrid system. The in vitro kinase assay showed that TSSK5 phosphorylated CREB at Ser-133. Using a CRE reporter system, we found that TSSK5 could stimulate the CREB/CRE responsive pathway in Hek293 cells. These results suggest that this kinase may be involved in spermatogenesis through phosphorylating CREB and then stimulating the CREB/CRE responsive pathway.",

        "abstract": "Much recent attention has been focused on Aurora C, the third member of the mammalian Aurora kinases family that plays significant roles in mitosis. We report here that using sensitive RT-PCR to amplify the C-terminal, we found that Aurora C is not only expressed highly in testis, but also among 16 other human tissues in a broad-spectrum way. Aurora C, as a chromosomal passenger protein, is co-localized with Aurora B and Survivin in mitotic cells. Aurora C can also be associated with Aurora B and Survivin in vivo and directly binds to Survivin but not Aurora B in vitro. Over-expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of Aurora C impaired the localization of Aurora C to the spindle midzone and severely disturbed the cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleation, all of which are consistent with the results induced by the mutant of Aurora B. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Aurora C could rescue the multinucleate phenotype produced by Aurora B mutant, and vice versa. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Aurora C, a member of the chromosomal passenger complex, is required for cytokinesis.",

This work focused on the effect of processing conditions on the microstructure and mechanical properties of these blends with various ratios of HPMC/HPS, in particular for incubation and drying conditions. To clearly identify the changes of starch phase in such blending system, the technique of dyeing HPS with iodine was developed and used. Rheometer, small angel X-ray scattering (SAXS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and mechanical testing apparatus were used to study the changes of microstructure and the relative properties of the blending gels and dried films incubated at different temperatures. It was found that the higher incubation temperature resulted in higher storage modulus, more solid-like behavior and more compact self-similar structure of the blending gel. Moreover, the films prepared from the gels dried at high temperature showed higher crystalline degree and more compact amorphous structure, and therefore result in increasing tensile strength and modulus but decreasing elongation.",

In this study, we identified and characterized a novel member of Ras family named RHEBL1, belonging to the Rheb branch of small GTPase proteins. The cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 551 bp, encoding a putative protein of 183 amino acid residues. The expression pattern of RHEBL1 showed that it was ubiquitously expressed in 17 tissues. RHEBL1 gene encodes a 20.69 kDa protein, localized in cytoplasm when overexpressed in COS7 cells. Reporter gene assays showed that overexpression of RHEBL1 in HEK 293T cells strongly activated the transcriptional activities of NF-kappa B, while the mutant (D60K) only weakly activates NF-kappa B-mediated transcription. Our findings suggest that RHEBL1 is a positive regulator of NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription.",

The STR has 11 alleles in Chinese, and its polymorphic information content (PIC) is 0.85. Mendelian segregation was shown in 2 Chinese pedigrees with two generations. This STR has been accurately relocalized on chromosome 14q24.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The accession numbers of this STR in GDB and GenBank database are D14S1435 and G31413 respectively. This STR would be able to be regarded as a novel genetic marker which can increase the genetic map accuracy in this chromosome region and improve the gene diagnosis on some genetic diseases located in chromosome 14q24.3 band.",

        "abstract": "NM23 expression is closely associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence, but the hereditary factors influencing NM23 levels are unknown. Using public database, the diagnostic value of  in HCC was investigated. A total of 424 hepatitis B virus- (HBV-) related HCC patients were enrolled to perform a genome-wide association study for identifying candidate variants associated with NM23 expression level. Additionally, a logistic regression model, haplotypes, and survival analysis were performed in the subsequent analysis. We identified high NM23 expression levels that have a diagnostic accuracy in HCC tissues and had a poor recurrence-free survival in HBV-related HCC patients. Variants near Psoriasis susceptibility 1 candidate 1 () and StAR related lipid transdomain containing 3 () are associated with NM23 expression. The  haplotype TGCACA and the  haplotype GG have favorable cumulative effects on NM23 expression. Further, variants in PSORS1C1 were associated with either overall survival (rs556285588, rs3095301, and rs3131003) only or overall survival and recurrence-free survival (rs560052000 and rs541820233) both in HCC patients. Our findings suggested that variants at the  and  loci play an important role in  regulation. Moreover, variants in  are potential biomarkers for the prediction of postoperative clinical outcomes in HBV-related HCC patients. Thus, variants in  and  are associated with NM23 expression and clinical outcomes of HBV-related HCC patients, which may be regarded as potential biomarkers for this disease.",

As long-term blood-pool feeders, the digestion of host blood is critical to their development as well as to the establishment of the sexual cycle of hemoparasites such as Babesia parasites, the agents of human and animal babesiosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that cysteine proteases are involved in blood digestion, embryogenesis, and pathogen transmission in other species of ticks, but their characteristics and functions are still unidentified in Haemaphysalis flava. Here, we describe the characterization of a cysteine protease HfCL from H. flava. We show that HfCL belongs to the L-like papain family of proteases, exhibits high expression in nymphs and adults, and localizes to both the midgut and salivary glands. Biochemical assays using purified recombinant enzyme reveal that rHfCL can hydrolyze the fluorogenic substrate Z-phe-Arg-MCA with optimal activity detected at pH 6. Furthermore, the short-term growth assay indicates that rHfCL can inhibit the intraerythrocytic development of Babesia microti and Babesia gibsoni in vitro.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) to anticancer drugs is a major obstacle to successful chemotherapy in the treatment of cancers. Identification of natural compounds capable of circumventing MDR with minimal adverse side effects is an attractive goal. Here, we found that H6, a gypenoside aglycon from Gynostemma pentaphyllum, displayed potent anti-MDR activity. Average resistant fold (RF) of H6 is 1.03 and 1.04 in KB/VCR and MCF-7/ADR cells compared to their parental cells. H6 alone ranging from 2 μmol/l to 40 μmol/l (μM) did not display a significant anti-proliferative effect on KB/VCR cells and other cells, while the compound at these concentrations enhanced the cytotoxicity of vincristine (VCR) to KB/VCR cells. H6 showed a significant synergistic effect in combination with VCR. By quantification of sub-G(1) fraction cells, H6 also enhanced the VCR-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The short time treatment with H6 increased the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 (Rho123) and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) in KB/VCR cells. Further studies showed that H6 treatment resulted in the decrease of the RNA transcript level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). H6 inhibited the function of P-gp by stimulating P-gp ATPase activity and decreased MRP1 expression with a blockade of STAT3 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that H6, a multi-targets reversal agent with no significant toxic effect, may be a potential candidate to circumvent the P-gp and MRP1-mediated MDR.",

However, SCA7 is a rare subtype of SCA, and most data available about SCA7 are those of white people. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the prevalence and clinical and genetic aspects of SCA7 patients in East Asian population.A search for publications on SCA7 was performed by using the \"PubMed\" database with the published language limited in English. Publications mainly focusing on the prevalence of SCA7 in patients with SCA and the clinical and genetic features of SCA7 patients were fully reviewed and analyzed.The prevalence of SCA7 in SCA patients ranged from 0 to 7.7%, which was similar to those reported previously. The clinical manifestations were typically present at the 30's of its victims (median, 29 years; interquartile range (IQR), 19.5-36.5 years), and the symptoms appeared 15 years ((15.17+/-4.22) years) earlier on average in the offspring than in the parents. Gait ataxia and visual impairment were both found in all patients of whom the clinical features were described. Mutant SCA7 alleles contained 40-100 CAG repeats, with a median of 47 repeats (IQR, 44.5-50.0); and the offspring had 13 more repeats on average compared with their parents (12.62+/-19.03). A strong negative correlation was found between CAG repeat size and the onset age of patients (r=-0.739, P=0.000). In addition, no significant difference was found in CAG repeat sizes between patients with visual impairment as the initial symptom and those with gait disturbance as their initial symptom (P=0.476).The prevalence of SCA7 in SCA patients, the age at onset and CAG repeats of SCA7 patients in East Asia are consistent with those of white people. However, larger population study is needed to assess the correlation between the CAG repeat size and initial symptoms of SCA7 patients in East Asia.",

        "abstract": "Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a naturally occurring component of phospholipid and plays a critical role in the regulation of many physiological and pathophysiological processes including cell growth, survival, and pro-angiogenesis. LPA is converted to phosphatidic acid by the action of lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT). Five members of the LPAAT gene family have been detected in humans to date. Here, we report the identification of a novel LPAAT member, which is designated as LPAAT-zeta. LPAAT-zeta was predicted to encode a protein consisting of 456 amino acid residues with a signal peptide sequence and the acyltransferase domain. Northern blot analysis showed that LPAAT-zeta was ubiquitously expressed in all 16 human tissues examined, with levels in the skeletal muscle, heart, and testis being relatively high and in the lung being relatively low. The human LPAAT-zeta gene consisted of 13 exons and is positioned at chromosome 8p11.21.",

Genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction and BstN1 or Rsa1 restriction enzyme assay. Analysis showed no significant difference between PD patients and controls for genotype or allele frequencies of the ACT and UCH-L1 S18Y polymorphisms. UCH-L1 S18Y polymorphism carriers, however, were found to be significantly less frequent in early-onset PD patients with a reduced risk of 0.557 (95% C.I. = 0.314-0.985; P = 0.043).

An increase in the starch content drastically improved the hydrophilicity of the blends, which was favorable for the diffusion of the embedded chitosan. Moreover, the release of chitosan was observed to occur in two stages, with a very fast release stage initially and a slow but durable release stage as the latter. These two stages exhibited the effectiveness and long residual action of antimicrobial property of the blends respectively, demonstrating the suitability to be used for foods with high water activity, such as fresh meat. The tensile and thermal properties further verified the promising use of the blend material in packaging.",

        "abstract": "Starches used to develop biodegradable composites belong to different botanical sources that exhibit different microstructures and morphologies. This results in confused relationship and no comparison of data for applications. In this work, the most popular ten different starches were used as model materials to investigate the relationship between starch microstructure and the performance of poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/starch composites. It was found that: (a) composites filled with either well-sized (small-sized and non-agglomerated) starch granules or those containing high amylose content (G-50 and G-80) improves the reinforcing ability of PLA, with least reduction in deformation; (b) aggregation tendency of small-sized starch granules can be controlled using surface modification approach that not only reduces the phase-separation between starch and PLA but also improves the dispersion; and (c) no discernible relationship exists between the starches, from different botanical sources, and the thermal performance of PLA/starch composites. The results provide practical guidelines to develop starch-based biodegradable composites for commercial applications. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 45504.",

        "abstract": "Human systemic carnitine deficiency (SCD) is a hereditary disease caused by the mutation of OCTN2 and has the characteristics of cardiac hypertrophy. Previous studies based on JVS mouse, an animal model of this disease, showed that Cdv-1 was highly expressed in ventricles of normal mouse, but was remarkably down-regulated in JVS mouse and can be up-regulated to normal level by breeding carnitine, which suggested Cdv-1 was possibly involved in cardiac hypertrophy caused by carnitine deficiency. In this study, the expression of human CDV-1, a homolog of mouse Cdv-1, was undetectable in heart by northern hybridization. The inconsistent expression levels of human CDV-1 and mouse Cdv-1 in heart implied that cardiac hypertrophy in human SCD might not be associated with the abnormal expression of CDV-1. Interestingly, another long transcripts of the gene, Cdv-1R/CDV-1R, were cloned in the present study, in mouse and human, respectively. This long transcript predominantly expressed in both human and mouse testis and its expression level was increased with testis development. Furthermore, we proved that the open reading frame of Cdv-1R/CDV-1R spans the exons 2 approximately 19 instead of exons 9 approximately 19; and the peptide encoded by CDV-1R was composed of 676 amino acids containing a putative signal peptide instead of 414 amino acids described previously. In addition, it was proved that the expression level of Cdv-1R in JVS mouse testis was as high as that in normal mouse testis, and both were not regulated by carnitine.",

        "abstract": "Membrane associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, has been extensively studied in cellular adhesion and signal transduction at sites of cell–cell contact. Recently, growing attention has been paid to its role in the initiation and progression of various cancers. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been rarely investigated. In this study, we found that membrane palmitoylated protein 3 (MPP3), a member of MAGUK family, was significantly up-regulated in both high metastatic potential cell lines and clinical tissue samples of HCC, and the most significant increase was observed in the tumors invading the portal veins. Higher level of MPP3 correlated with poorer survival of patients with HCC. Forced expression of MPP3 significantly enhanced HCC cell migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of this gene inhibited this oncogenic effect. Mechanismly, we found that MPP3 promoted HCC cell migration and invasion via up-regulating matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1). These findings indicate that MPP3 play an important role in HCC metastasis by promoting cell migration and invasion, suggesting that it may serve as a novel prognostic marker and molecular target for therapy of HCC.",

        "abstract": "Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase belongs to the subfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR), and 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase catalyzes the interconversion of inactive glucocorticoids (cortisone in human, dehydrocorticosterone in rodents) and active glucocorticoids (cortisol in human, corticosterone in rodents). We report here the cloning and characterization of a novel human SDR gene SCDR10B which encodes a protein with similarity to 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1. SCDR10B was isolated from a human brain cDNA library, and was mapped to chromosome 19p13.3 by browsing the UCSC genomic database. It contains an ORF with a length of 858 bp, encoding a protein with a transmembrane helix and SDR domain. Its molecular mass and isoelectric point are predicted to be 30.8 kDa and 10.3 kDa, respectively. SCDR10B protein is highly conserved in mammals and fish. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that SCDR10B stands for a new subgroup in the 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family. Northern blot analysis showed that SCDR10B was highly expressed in brain, and a strong expression signal was detected in hippocampal neurons by immunohistochemical analysis. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis showed that SCDR10B was up-regulated in lung-cancer cell lines and human lung cancer. SCDR10B can catalyze the dehydrogenation of cortisol in the presence of NADP(+), and therefore it is a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.",

        "abstract": "The oncoprotein MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets tumor suppressor p53 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, restraining the potent activity of p53 and enabling cell survival and proliferation. Dysregulation of MDM2-p53 axis was frequently observed in human cancers. Originally, it is proposed that MDM2 degradation was mainly achieved by destructive self-ubiquitination. However, recent study suggests that MDM2 may be targeted for degradation by an external E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) under physiological levels. Here, we identified E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF12 as an MDM2-interacting protein through yeast two hybrid methods. We demonstrated that RNF12 targets MDM2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal-dependent degradation, which is independent of MDM2u0027s self-ubiquitination activity. Accordingly, RNF12 elevates p53 protein level by abrogating MDM2-mediated p53 degradation and ubiquitination. Finally, we showed that RNF12 regulates cell growth suppression and DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Taken together, we establish RNF12 as a novel positive regulator of p53 pathway and an external E3 ubiquitin ligase for MDM2 destruction. These data shed light on the potential roles of RNF12 in MDM2-p53 axis and tumor suppression.",

        "abstract": "Biodegradable films, with starch as a matrix, were developed and reinforced with wheat and corn hulls. The effect of the particle size of the filler on the microstructure and mechanical and barrier properties of starch-based films was investigated. We observed that the addition of hulls enhanced the modulus, tensile strength, and impact strength of the starch matrix at the expense of its elongation. The water-vapor transmission rate results show that corn starch was more efficient in reducing the water-vapor permeability than wheat hulls. Scanning electron microscopy observations indicated that the compatibility of both fillers with the matrix was quite good; this was expected because all of the components used in this study were hydrophilic and exhibited polar behavior. Optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction observations indicated that the processing conditions did not affect the crystalline and geometric structures of the hulls. Because all of the components used in this study were from food resources, the films could also be used for edible packaging. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 45159.",

        "abstract": "We have identified two novel human SCAN domain genes ZNF396 and ZNF397, which are clustered within the region of chromosome 18q12. Three isoforms of ZNF396 transcript, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.9-kb, are expressed highly in liver. Four isoforms of ZNF397 transcript, 1.7, 2.5, 7.0 and 9.0-kb, are expressed in a variety of tissues, with varying levels. The SCAN-(C(2)H(2))(X) genes encode two distinct proteins due to a unique alternative splicing mechanism. Both ZNF396-fu (full zinc fingers) and ZNF397-fu consist of a SCAN domain in the N-terminal region and many consecutive C(2)H(2) zinc finger repeats in the C-terminal region. ZNF396-nf (no zinc fingers) and ZNF397-nf encode 210 and 198 amino acids, respectively, containing the SCAN domain only. ZNF396-fu, ZNF396-nf, ZNF397-fu or ZNF397-nf can homo-associate, while ZNF396-fu hetero-associates with ZNF396-nf, and ZNF397-fu hetero-associates with ZNF397-nf. ZNF396-nf and ZNF397-nf polypeptides are expressed diffusely in the cells, while ZNF396-fu and ZNF397-fu polypeptides target specifically to the nuclei. ZNF396-fu, ZNF396-nf and ZNF397-nf can repress reporter gene transcription, with ZNF397-nf having the strongest repression activity. Deletion analysis revealed that ZNF397-fu is a transcriptional activator without its nine zinc finger repeats.",

        "title": "Association between microRNA polymorphisms and cancer risk based on the findings of 66 case-control studies",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules, which participate in diverse biological processes and may regulate tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA may contribute to diverse functional consequences, including cancer development, by altering miRNA expression. Numerous studies have shown the association between miRNA SNPs and cancer risk; however, the results are generally debatable and inconclusive, mainly due to limited statistical power. To assess the relationship between the five most common SNPs (miR-146a rs2910164, miR-196a2 rs11614913, miR-499 rs3746444, miR-149 rs2292832, and miR-27a rs895919) and the risk cancer development, we performed a meta-analysis of 66 published case-control studies. Crude odds ratios at 95% confidence intervals were used to investigate the strength of the association. No association was observed between rs2910164 and cancer risk in the overall group. However, in stratified analysis, we found that either the rs2910164 C allele or the CC genotype was protective against bladder cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer, whereas it was a risk factor for papillary thyroid carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Further, rs11614913 was found to be significantly associated with decreased cancer risk, in particular, for bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and SCCHN. For miR-499, a significant association was found between the rs3746444 polymorphism and cancer risk in pooled analysis. In subgroup analysis, similar results were mainly observed for breast cancer. Finally, no association was found between rs2292832 and rs895919 polymorphisms and cancer risk in the overall group and in stratified analysis. In summary, miR-196a2 rs11614913, miR-146a rs2910164, and miR-499 rs3746444 are risk factors for cancer development, whereas mir-149 rs2292832 and miR-27a rs895919 are not associated with cancer risk. © 2013 Ma et al.",

In this study, we identify a new function of neuritin as a novel angiogenic factor in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant neuritin protein had no effect on the proliferation and adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), but it dose-dependently increased endothelial cell migration. Furthermore, overexpression of neuritin significantly promoted tumor angiogenesis, and surprisingly, it inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model. Thus, our results indicate that neuritin may act as an important angiogenic factor and serve as a potential target for cancer therapy.",

Although a potential transcriptional suppression function of TCP10L has been reported previously, biological function of this gene still remains largely elusive. In this study, we reported for the first time that TCP10L was significantly down-regulated in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples when compared to the corresponding non-tumorous liver tissues. Furthermore, TCP10L expression was highly correlated with advanced cases exceeding the Milan criteria. Overexpression of TCP10L in HCC cells suppressed colony formation, inhibited cell cycle progression through G0/G1 phase, and attenuated cell growth in vivo. Consistently, silencing of TCP10L promoted cell cycle progression and cell growth. Therefore, our study has revealed a novel suppressor role of TCP10L in HCC, by inhibiting proliferation of HCC cells, which may facilitate the diagnosis and molecular therapy in HCC.",

Cornstarches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios were used as model materials. Since the samples covered both A-type (high amylopectin starch: waxy and maize) and B-type (high amylose starch: G50 and G80) crystals, the results can be used to clarify some previous confusion. The effect of annealing and pressure on the crystallinity and double helices were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and (13)C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy. The crystal form of various starches remained unchanged after annealing and pressure treatment. XRD detection showed that the relative crystallinity (RC) of high amylopectin starches was increased slightly after annealing, while the RC of high amylose-rich starches remained unchanged. NMR measurement supported the XRD results. The increase can be explained by the chain relaxation. XRD results also indicated that some of the fixed region in crystallinity was susceptible to outside forces. The effect of annealing and pressure on starch gelatinization temperature and enthalpy are used to explore the mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, a strain-gradient crystal plasticity theory with irradiation effect is proposed for the surface nano-indentation of ion-irradiated FCC metals. In order to characterize the indentation size effect and irradiation hardening of ion-irradiated materials indented by the Berkovich indenter, the hardening contributions of geometrically necessary dislocations and non-uniformly distributed defects are incorporated into the classical crystal plasticity theory. The constitutive equations are implemented into ABAQUS through the user material subroutine VUMAT to numerically simulate the surface nano-indentation of ion-irradiated single crystal copper. The theoretical model is calibrated by comparing the numerical results with experimental data. Both the simulated force-depth relationship without irradiation effect and hardness-depth relationship with/without irradiation effect can match well with corresponding experimental data. The dominant features as observed in the nano-indentation of ion-irradiated materials can be effectively characterized by the proposed theoretical framework, which include the indentation size effect, depth-dependent irradiation hardening, and unirradiated substrate softening effect. Moreover, the evolution of different hardening mechanisms during the surface nano-indentation is systematically analyzed to help understand the macroscopic deformation behavior.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the expression level of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in a macrophage-derived foam cell model from human U937 cell line and the inhibitory effect of imperatorin (IMP) on the ICAM-1.U937 cells were incubated with oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) 80 mg/L for 48 h and a macrophage-derived foam cell model was established. The medium was pretreated with different concentrations of IMP (0, 25, 50, 100 micromol/L). ICAM-1 protein expression in cells was measured with Western blotting; ICAM-1 mRNA level in cells was measured by Northern blotting.After incubated with ox-LDL, ICAM-1 expression level increased greatly. The increase in ICAM-1 protein level and mRNA level was estimated to be about 15-fold and 10-fold. When the cells were pretreated with imperatorin (50, 100 micromol/L), the increase of ICAM-1 in foam cells were remarkably inhibited. Especially when pretreated with IMP 100 micromol/L, the ICAM-1 protein level decreased by 79 % and the mRNA level decreased by 74 % each compared to the level of foam cells.After incubated with ox-LDL in vitro, the U937 foam cells showed an enhanced ICAM-1 expression compared with normal U937 cells. IMP could inhibit the expression of ICAM-1 in U937 foam cells.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is an ADP- ribosylation enzyme and plays important roles in a variety of cellular processes, including DNA damage response and tumor development. However, the post-transcriptional regulation of PARP1 remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified that the mRNA of PARP1 is associated with nuclear factor 90 (NF90) by RNA immunoprecipitation plus sequencing (RIP-seq) assay. The mRNA and protein levels of PARP1 are dramatically decreased in NF90-depleted cells, and NF90 stabilizes PARP1u0027s mRNA through its 3′UTR. Moreover, the expression levels of PARP1 and NF90 are positively correlated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Finally, we demonstrated that NF90-depleted cells are sensitive to PARP inhibitor Olaparib (AZD2281) and DNA damage agents. Taken together, these results suggest that NF90 regulates PARP1 mRNA stability in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and NF90 is a potential target to inhibit PARP1 activity.",

It was reported the 29T/C polymorphism in TGF-β1 has been implicated in breast cancer risk. However, studies on the association between this polymorphism and breast cancer remain conflicting. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis of 10,341 cases and 15,655 controls from fifty published case-control studies was performed. Our analysis suggested that 29T/C has no association with a trend of breast cancer risk when using both dominant [odds ratio (OR) = 1.01, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.96-1.07] and recessive models (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.89-1.08) to analyze the data. In ethnic subgroups analysis, 29T/C also did not appear to be risk factors for breast cancer. However, larger scale primary studies are required to further evaluate the interaction of TGF-β1 29T/C polymorphism and breast cancer risk in specific populations.",

Microarray experiments were used to screen for global effects of UNC50 knockdown in the Hep3B cell line, and were confirmed by real-time PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and tetrazolium assay in both UNC50 overexpression and knockdown Hep3B cells.UNC50 expression levels were upregulated in HCC tissues in comparison with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. UNC50 knockdown reduced mRNA levels of the downstream targets of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway: cyclin D1 (CCND1), EGF, matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7), aldose reductase-like 1 (AKR1B10), cell surface-associated mucin 1 (MUC1), and gastrin (GAST). Moreover, UNC50 influenced EGF, inducing cell cycle entry by affecting cell surface EGFR amounts.UNC50 may plays some roles in HCC progression by affecting the EGFR pathway.",

In order to overcome,disadvantages,such as poor,mechanical properties of polymers from renewable resources, or to offset the high price of synthetic biodegradable polymers, various blends and composites,have been developed,over the last decade. The progress of blends from three kinds of polymers,from renewable resources—(1) natural polymers, such as starch, protein and cellulose; (2) synthetic polymers from natural monomers, such as polylactic acid; and (3) polymers from microbial fermentation, such as polyhydroxybutyrate—are described with an emphasis,on potential applications. The hydrophilic character of natural polymers,has contributed to the successful development of environmentally friendly composites, as most natural fibers and nanoclays are also hydrophilic in nature. Compatibilizers and the technology,of reactive extrusion are used to improve,the interfacial adhesion,between natural and synthetic polymers. r,2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

        "abstract": "Uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) plays an important role in breast cancer development. To date, many publications have evaluated the correlation between UGT1A1 TA-repeat polymorphism and breast cancer risk. However, the results remain inconclusive. In order to resolve this conflict, a meta-analysis was performed by searching Medline, PubMed, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases. Seven studies including 5,746 cases and 8,365 controls were collected for UGT1A1 TA-repeat polymorphism. The strength of association between UGT1A1 TA-repeat polymorphism and breast cancer risk was assessed by calculating crude ORs with 95% CIs. Overall, no significant associations between UGT1A1 TA-repeat polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility were found. In the stratified analysis by ethnicity and source of controls, significant associations were only observed for 6/6 versus 7/7 (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.77-0.99; P = 0.425 for heterogeneity) in Caucasians, but no in other genetic models. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that UGT1A1 A(TA)(7)TAA allele is a potential risk factor for breast cancer in Caucasians.",

        "abstract": "Survivin is associated with Aurora B, inner centromere protein (INCENP), and borealin to form a chromosomal passenger complex that plays multiple roles during cell division. We used mutational analysis to study interaction of Survivin with Aurora B and the effect of this interaction on cell division. A Survivin mutant with the terminal domain deleted (Survivin 1-107) bound Aurora B as efficiently as Survivin wild type. This indicated that the proximal BIR domain of Survivin was responsible for Survivin binding to Aurora B. Survivin mutants (Surv-R18A, Surv-D53A, and Sur-KK78, and 79AA) all bound to Aurora B efficiently, but mutation in the conserved amino acid residues of the acidic patch on Survivin (Surv-DD70, 71AA) abolished the direct interaction of Survivin and Aurora B. The Survivin mutant (Surv-DD70, 71AA) localized diffusely in metaphase and failed to successfully accumulate in the midbody during cytokinesis. Furthermore, over-expression of the Survivin mutant (Surv-DD70, 71AA) severely disturbed cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleation in HeLa cell. This indicated that the direct interaction of Survivin and Aurora B was critical for the correct location of Survivin and the function of the Survivin complex in cell division.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To screen the insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1) gene sequence in type 2 diabetics, idiopathic type 1 diabetics and control subjects in Shanghai, so as to investigate the role of IPF-1 gene in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Methods: 1 Between May 2002 and December 2003 , 201 type 2 diabetics (94 males and 107 females, type 2 diabetic group) and 4 idiopathic type 1 diabetics (3 males and 1 female, idiopathic type 1 diabetic group), who were hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University, and 100 healthy physical examinees (control group) all participated in the study voluntarily. 2 The biochemical indexes and antibody related to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus were detected. Two exons of IPF-1 (including the coding and flanking regions) were amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After being purified, the PCR products were directly sequenced with ABI 377 automatic DNA sequencer. The mutation was confirmed by digestion of the PCR products with restriction enzyme. 3 The data of normal distribution were expressed as mean±SD, the data of partial distribution were expressed as M, C peptide showed partial distribution, but normal distribution after being changed to the logarithm taking 10 as base. Results: All the 201 type 2 diabetics, 4 i diopathic type 1 diabetics and 100 healthy subjects entered the analysis of results. No IPF-1 gene mutation was found in either the type 2 diabetic group or control group, and A P239Q (CCG-CAG) heterozygous mutation was detected in one case of the idiopathic type 1 diabetic group. The PCR product was partially digested into fragments of 347 bp and 252 bp by restriction enzyme Pst I. Conclusion: 1 The results suggest that IPF-1 gene does not play an i mportant role in the development of type 2 diabetes in Shanghai. 2 A P239Q (CCG-CAG) heterozygous mutation was found in one of the idiopathic type 1 diabetics. More samples and further pedigree investigation will be required to make clear the relationship between IPF-1 gene mutation and islet dysfunction during the early stage of idiopathic type 1 diabetes. It may provide a new clue for the pathogenesis study of idiopathic type 1 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "An ultraviolet (UV) light-triggered nanocarbon hybrid is developed for controlled C release with excellent nitric oxide (NO) quenching ability. This nanocarrier, consisting of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), is capable of hosting azobenzene functionalized C (Azo-C) synthesized by diazo chemistry. The hybridization of rGO, β-CD and Azo-C enhances cellular uptake and limits the aggregation of C, and shows enhanced protective effects on NO-induced cytotoxicity. More interestingly, azo groups can reversibly switch between trans- and cis-isomers upon UV irradiation, so that the Azo-C molecules exhibit photo-controlled release from rGO/β-CD in living cells. In vitro studies show that rGO/β-CD/C treated with UV irradiation causes higher NO scavenging efficacy, which further significantly increases the cell viability from 32.6% to 88.4% at low loading levels (50 μg mL). This represents an excellent NO quenching efficiency, better than other reports of the graphene/C nanohybrids, and indicates that this material can be an effective nanoplatform to combat oxidative damage. As the host-guest chemistry and diazo chemistry are versatile and universally applicable, it is worth noting that the present strategy can also be applied in preparing other photo-responsive nanohybrids, which should be valuable for use in life science and materials science.",

To date, many publications have evaluated the correlation between cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) T3801C polymorphism and breast cancer risk. However, the results remain inconclusive. In order to derive a more precise estimation of the association, a meta-analysis was performed in this study. By searching Medline, PubMed, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, 23 studies including 10,520 cases and 14,567 controls were collected for CYP1A1 T3801C polymorphism. The strength of association between CYP1A1 T3801C polymorphism and breast cancer risk was assessed by calculating crude ORs with 95% CIs. The pooled ORs were performed for codominant model, dominant model, and recessive model, respectively. Overall, no significant associations between CYP1A1 T3801C polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility were found for TT versus CC (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.72-1.19), TC versus CC (OR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.79-1.14), TT + TC versus CC (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.75-1.15), and TT versus TC + CC (OR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.87-1.13). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, menopausal status, and source of controls, no significant associations were detected in all genetic models. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides strong evidence that CYP1A1 T3801C polymorphism is not associated with breast cancer risk.",

The calculatedmolecular weight of the deduced protein is 17.3 kU. Thepredicted isoelectric point is 4.89. On account of itshigh homology to mouse neuronal protein NP15.6(81.2% identity), the deduced protein was namedneuronal protein 17.3 (NP17.3). When its secondarystructure was examined by the GGBSM program of PCGENEsoftware, it was found that 32.6 and 15.0% of itsamino acids are involved in formingalpha-helices and beta-sheets, respectively.

The internal existence status of Tssk4 in testis of mice was detected using western blotting and dephosphorylation method. The interaction of Tssk4 and Crem was analyzed by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assays, and in vitro kinase assay. The results revealed that Tssk4 existed in testis both in phosphorylation and unphosphorylation status by a temporal manner with the development of testis. Immunofluorescence results showed that Tssk4 had identical distribution pattern with Crem in testis, which was utterly different to the localization of Cre-responsive element binding (Creb). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that phosphorylated Tssk4 might participate in testis genes expressions by phosphorylating Crem at Ser-117. ",

        "abstract": "The tick- and transfusion-transmitted human pathogen  infects host erythrocytes to cause the pathologic symptoms associated with human babesiosis, an emerging disease with worldwide distribution and potentially fatal clinical outcome. Drugs currently recommended for the treatment of babesiosis are associated with a high failure rate and significant adverse events, highlighting the urgent need for more-effective and safer babesiosis therapies. Unlike other apicomplexan parasites,  lacks a canonical lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) but instead expresses a unique enzyme,  LDH (BmLDH), acquired through evolution by horizontal transfer from a mammalian host. Here, we report the crystal structures of BmLDH in apo state and ternary complex (enzyme-NADH-oxamate) solved at 2.79 and 1.89 Å. Analysis of these structures reveals that upon binding to the coenzyme and substrate, the active pocket of BmLDH undergoes a major conformational change from an opened and disordered to a closed and stabilized state. Biochemical assays using wild-type and mutant  and human LDHs identified Arg99 as a critical residue for the catalytic activity of BmLDH but not its human counterpart. Interestingly, mutation of Arg99 to Ala had no impact on the overall structure and affinity of BmLDH to NADH but dramatically altered the closure of the enzyme's active pocket. Together, these structural and biochemical data highlight significant differences between  and human LDH enzymes and suggest that BmLDH could be a suitable target for the development of selective antibabesial inhibitors.-Yu, L., Shen, Z., Liu, Q., Zhan, X., Luo, X., An, X., Sun, Y., Li, M., Wang, S., Nie, Z., Ao, Y., Zhao, Y., Peng, G., Ben Mamoun, C., He, L., Zhao, J.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that, in mammals, the highly expressed genes have shorter gene length and their protein products have relatively lower evolutionary rates. However, the global relationship between genes' expression level and their features such as tissue-specificity, function and protein subcellular localization has not been investigated extensively, especially in mammalian. In order to solve it, we analysed 8,570 genes across 46 human tissues. Our results suggest that widely expressed genes have higher mean expression levels than tissue-specific ones and genes encoding zinc-finger proteins have low expression levels similar to that of DNA-binding proteins. In the analysis of protein subcellular localization, it is shown that nuclear and Golgi apparatus proteins have lower mean expression levels than those of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and membrane proteins, while genes encoding cytoplasm and extracellular components display the highest expression levels. When comparing the gene expression levels and the number of expressed genes in different tissues, we found that some tissues have less active genes while single gene encodes relatively more transcripts. Taken together, gene expression levels are clearly correlated with their tissue-specificity, function and protein subcellular localization, and are highly conserved during evolution.",

        "abstract": "Substrate clogging is the worst operational problem for subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS), nevertheless quantitative understanding of the clogging process is currently very limited. In this study, the developing process of clogging caused by organic particle accumulation and biofilm growth was investigated in two groups of lab-scale SWIS, which were fed with glucose (dissolved organic matter) and starch (particulate organic matter) influent and filled with the same substrate made of 50% brown soil and cinder at a weight of 50%. Results showed that in glucose-fed systems the growth of biofilm in the substrate pores certainly caused remarkable reduction of effective porosity, especially for the high concentration organic wastewater, whereas its influence on infiltration rate was negligible. In comparison with biofilm growth, organic particles accumulation could rapidly reduce infiltration rate and the clogging occurred in the upper layer in starch-fed systems and the most important contribution of biofilm growth to clogging was accelerating the occurrence of clogging.

        "abstract": "Corn starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios were used to explore the effect of rheological behaviors of concentrated system on the graft copolymerization of acrylamide and resultant hydrogels, which sheds a light on their reactive extrusion process. The viscoelastic moduli of starch melts increased with increasing amylose content (AC), leading to a decreased extent of micro-mixing detected by a reduced rheokinetic rate. With increasing AC, the graft efficiency was decreased but with almost similar monomer conversion (about 87.5%) and nearly equivalent graft content. XRD and SAXS spectra revealed that the extent of retrogradation of the starches were increased and two-phase separation was enhanced for hydrogels with increasing AC. Interestingly, microscopic analysis showed the superabsorbent hydrogel from the starch with AC of 50% exhibited a gridding membrane porous structure, resulting in a higher water absorbent capacity of 550 g/g. This was attributed to the moderate crosslinking and the slightly greater graft content.",

Here we report the cloning and characterization of another novel human 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase member AGPAT7 (1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 7) gene, which was mapped to human chromosome 15q14. The AGPAT7 cDNA is 1898 bp in length, encoding a putative protein with 524 amino acid residues, which contains an acyltransferase domain in 123-234 aa. RT PCR amplification in 18 human tissues indicated that human AGPAT7 gene was widely expressed in uterus, thymus, pancreas, skeletal muscle, bladder, stomach, lung and testis. AGPAT7 protein was mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Hela cells.",

Evidence shows that PKB undergoes activation\n in some human tumors and is involved in Ras pathway, which implies that PKB can trigger a pathway to induce oncogenic transformation.\n A nucleotide sequence of mousePkbγ was used as a probe to screen homolog in a human liver cDNA library. A fragment of 1998 bp containing a 1440 bp ORF encoding\n 479 amino acid residues was obtained. Then the 3′-terminal of this fragment was extended to 2788 bp by ‘electronic walking’\n screening, and the extended fragment was confirmed by PCR amplification. The protein deduced by the gene had a high identity\n of 83% and 78% to the human PKBα and β, respectively, and was designated as humanPKBγ. Northern hybridization detected two equally expressed transcripts of 8.5 and 6.5 kb in length in all 16 human tissues tested,\n with the highest expression level in brain, and lower levels with variation in the other tissues. By RH mapping, thePKBγ was placed on chromosome 1q43, between markers D1S304 and D1S2693. It is a valuable clue for cloning the candidate genes\n related to prostate cancer; Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD); Chediak-Higashi, NK cell Deficiency (CHS);\n and Hypoparathyrodism with Short Stature, Mental Retardation and Seizures which have already been mapped in this chromosomal\n region.",

It was found that the gelatinization temperature of starch with excess moisture content (>70%) was at approximately 75 °C. A new endotherm was detected at about 173 °C when the moisture content was lower than required for full gelatinization of the starch. A detailed examination revealed that this endotherm represented the melting of amylose-lipid complexes. Breadfruit starch paste exhibited shear-thinning fluid characteristics, and good thermal and pH stability. The setback viscosity of the breadfruit starch was lower than that of potato and corn starches. The rheological properties of the breadfruit starch paste was well described by the Herschel-Bulkley model at a shear rate of 0 to 100 s(-1), where R(2) is greater than 0.95, and it behaved like a yield-pseudoplastic fluid. Both the storage modulus and loss modulus of the paste initially increased sharply, then dropped after reaching the gelatinization peak. Breadfruit starch gel showed both flexibility and viscosity. Suspension with 6% starch content exhibited very weak gel rigidity; however, this increased significantly at starch contents above 20%.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, a brain abundant member of beta 4-galactosyltransferase gene family with an open reading frame encoding 343 amino acids was cloned and identified from a human leukemia cell cDNA library. The putative protein sequence is about 94.8 and 94.2% identical to the 382-amino-acid mouse and rat beta 4-galactosyltransferase respectively and also contains cysteine residues previously shown to be important for the function of the gene family members. This cDNA (tentatively termed beta 4GalT-VIb) is identical to a recently reported cDNA (tentatively termed beta 4GalT-VIa) of human beta 4-galactosyltransferase except lacking one exon, suggesting that these two cDNAs are two different alternative transcripts of the same gene. Northern hybridization showed that the new alternative transcript, beta 4GalT-VIb, is expressed in all 16 human tissues tested with highest level in brain and rich level in testis, thymus and pancreas, whereas weak expression was detected in lung. The beta 4GalT-VIb gene was located to human chromosome 18q12.1 between markers WI-9180 and SGC35630 by radiation hybrid mapping. The genomic organization and adjacent gene content of beta 4GalT-VIb were identified by comparing its cDNA sequence with three genomic sequences AC017100, AP002474 and AP001336, which showed that beta 4GalT-VIb spans an approximately 58 kb region and is composed of 8 exons. In addition, the most conserved motif composed of 41 residues, LXYX3FGGVSXL(T/S)X2 QFX2INGFPNX(Y/F)WGWGGEDDDX2NR, was defined according to 17 sequences of beta 4GalTs from seven different organisms for the first time.",

        "abstract": "Edible starch film reinforced by laver was developed and characterized. The relationship between processing technologies, microstructures and performances was established. When the laver was added into cold starch suspension, the laver flack (fiber) simply act as reinforcing agent to improve the mechanical properties of the starch matrix, which results in increasing modulus and tensile strength. When the laver was added into hot starch suspension and mixed under shear stress, the protein containing in laver will release out and mix with starch, which results in a starch-protein-laver fiber hybrid composites. In the hybrids system, fiber improves the mechanical properties of the starch-based film about 25%, while the protein reduces the moisture sensitivity and gas permeability about 45%. Scanning electron microscopic observation indicated good compatibility between starch matrix and laver. The cellulose containing in laver kept its semi-crystalline structure after processing, which was used to explain the reinforcing mechanism. Some chemical bounds between starch and protein containing in laver was detected by FTIR. Since all the components used in this work are from food sources, the prepared films are safe for food packaging and application as edible films.",

        "abstract": "A full-length cDNA of 3192 bp isolated from human bone marrow cDNA library was predicted an ORF encoding 298 amino acids. The deduced protein, containing seven putative transmembrane segments and sharing 75.8% amino acid identity with mouse Myadm protein, was named as human MYADM. The results of Northern blot analysis showed that MYADM was ubiquitously expressed in 15 of 16 adult tissues tested, except thymus. To determine whether the novel human gene was involved in hematopoietic differentiation process as mouse Myadm did, we examined the mRNA expressive abundance of this gene between normal bone marrow cells and peripheral blood leukocytes, and detected the expression change in NB4 cells induced by all–trans retinoic acid at different induce time by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that the expression of the novel gene was not only significantly higher in peripheral blood leukocytes than in bone marrow cells, but also significantly up-regulated when the NB4 cells(derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia) were induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 48hr. It is suggested that human MYADM was also associated with the differentiation of hematopoietic cells or acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. In addition, MYADM was mapped to human chromosome 19q13.33-q13.4 by Radiation Hybrid mapping, and it consists of 3 exons and 2 introns and spans a 7.1-Kb genomic region.",

Attention is paid to two types of radiation-induced defects: interstitial dislocation loops and solute rich clusters, which are believed to be the main sources of hardening in Fe-Cr alloys at medium irradiation doses. Both the hardening mechanism and microstructural evolution are investigated by using available experimental data on microstructures, and implementing hardening rules derived from atomistic data. Good agreement with experimental data is achieved for both the yield stress and strain hardening of non-irradiated and irradiated Fe-Cr alloys by treating dislocation loops as strong thermally activated obstacles and solute rich clusters as weak shearable ones.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant cancers. Conventional therapies are limited due to the human liver being such a unique organ and easily showing side-effects. The unclear molecular mechanisms are tough challenges for scientists searching for new and effective anti-HCC targeting drugs. We identified that the nuclear receptor NR4A2 is a novel oncogene in HCC progression. In this study, we show that NR4A2 and the notch recceptor Notch1 were expressed highly in primary HCC tissues and immortal HCC cells by using qPCR, western blot and immuno-histochemistry assays. Both genes were observed to stimulate HCC cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by using cell proliferation assays and FACS assays. We also observed that the four notch receptor subtypes (Notch1-4) displayed different effects on HCC cell growth. The over-expression of Notch1 by transiently transfecting the intracellular domain of Notch1 (ICN1, Notch1 active form) increased the expression of NR4A2, with the knockdown of Notch1 decreasing NR4A2. This indicates that NR4A2 is one of the Notch-mediated downstream genes. Moreover, both NR4A2 and Notch1 suppressed the expression of tumor suppressors p21 and p63. These findings support that Notch1/NR4A2 co-regulate HCC cell functions by playing oncogenic roles and regulating the associated downstream signaling pathways. Novel Notch1/NR4A2-mediated oncogenic signaling may provide us a great opportunity for anti-HCC drug development.",

        "abstract": "In the last 10 years, Aurora kinases have emerged as the key proteins regulating many events during cell mitosis. Despite the wealth of studies on human Aurora A and B, little is known about human Aurora C. Here we report a novel splicing variant of Aurora C, named as Aurora C-SV (Aurora C splicing variant), which encodes a 290-amino-acid protein. By RT-PCR analysis in various tissues, Aurora C-SV, like Aurora C, was found to be expressed at the highest level in human testis. The in vitro kinase assay showed that this Aurora C-SV phosphorylated MBP, and its T179A mutant lost the kinase activity. During cell mitosis, Aurora C-SV-EGFP associated with chromosomes in prophase and metaphase, and then transferred to the central spindle midzone and the cortex where the contract ring formed during the transition from anaphase to telophase. It then remained in the midbody during cytokinesis. Therefore, we speculated that Aurora C-SV might also contribute to the regulation of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis.",

Such modification was realized by grafting with alkanols of different chain lengths (hexanol, dodecanol and octadecanol) on the surface of starch-based films. The grafting of alkanol increased the mobility of glycerol as the plasticizer within the film surface. Also, this grafting increased the mass ratio of carbon to oxygen on the film surface but reduced the mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen. Under the same reaction conditions, there were fewer dodecyl chains grafted onto the film surface than hexyl or octadecyl chains. Furthermore, the results revealed that the surface hydrophobicity of starch-based films could be enhanced by simply increasing the alkyl chain length. Also, fewer alkyl chains tended to reduce the surface hydrophobicity of the films. These results are valuable for the rational design of starch-based materials with demanded hydrophobic properties.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorylation on serine/threonine or tyrosine residues of target proteins is an essential and significant regulatory mechanism in signal transduction during many cellular and life processes, including spermatogenesis, oogenesis and fertilization. In the present work, we reported the isolation and characterization of mouse testis-specific serine/threonine kinase 5 (Tssk5), which contains four alternatively spliced variants including, Tssk5alpha, Tssk5beta, Tssk5gamma and Tssk5delta. Moreover, the locus of Tssk5 is on chromosome 14qC3 and the four variants had a similar high expression in the testis and the heart; however, had a low expression in other tissues, except for Tssk5alpha which also had comparably high expression in the spleen. Each variant of Tssk5 expression began in the testis 16 days after birth. Aside from TSSK5alpha, the other isoforms have an insertion of ten amino acid residues (RLTPSLSAAG) in region VIb (HRD domain) (His-Arg-Asp). Moreover, only TSSK5alpha exhibited kinase activity and consistently, a further Luciferase Reporter Assay demonstrated that TSSK5beta, TSSK5gamma and TSSK5delta cannot be stimulated at the CREB/CRE responsive pathway in cmparison to TSSK5alpha. These findings suggest that TSSK5beta, TSSK5gamma, TSSK5delta may be pseudokinases due to the insertion, which may damage the structure responsible for active kinase activity. Pull-down assay experiments indicated that TSSK5beta, TSSK5gamma and TSSK5delta can directly interact with TSSK5alpha. In summary, these four isoforms with similar expression patterns may be involved in spermatogenesis through a coordinative way in testis.",

        "abstract": "Our current study investigates the prognostic values of genetic variants and mRNA expression of cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase () in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 19 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the exons of  were genotyped using Sanger sequencing from 476 HBV-related HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy between 2003 and 2013. The mRNA expression of  in 212 patients with HBV-related HCC was obtained from GSE14520 dataset. Survival analysis was performed to investigate the association of  variants and mRNA expression with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Nomograms were used to predict the prognosis of HBV-related HCC patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the mechanism of  in HBV-related HCC prognosis. The polymorphism -rs1057868 was significantly associated with HBV-related HCC OS (CT/TT vs. CC, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.54, 0.88],  = 0.003), but not significantly associated with RFS (CT/TT vs. CC,  = 0.378).  mRNA expression was also significantly associated with HBV-related HCC OS (high vs. low, HR = 0.61, 95% CI = [0.38, 0.97],  = 0.036), but not significantly associated with the RFS (high vs. low,  = 0.201). Two nomograms were developed to predict the HBV-related HCC OS. Furthermore, GSEA suggests that multiple gene sets were significantly enriched in liver cancer survival and recurrence, as well as -related target therapy in the liver. In conclusion, our study suggests that -rs1057868 and mRNA expression may serve as a potential postoperative prognosis biomarker in HBV-related HCC.",

It contains a PX (phox homology) domain and two pseudo-kinase domains, and co-localizes with sphingosine kinase-1 on early endosomes. In this study we identified a novel RPK118-binding protein, PRDX3 (peroxiredoxin-3), by yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction between these proteins was confirmed by pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Deletion studies showed that RPK118 interacted with PRDX3 through its pseudokinase domains, and with early endosomes through its PX domain. Double immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that PRDX3 co-localized with RPK118 on early endosomes in COS7 cells. PRDX3 is a member of the antioxidant family of proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm and functioning in mitochondria. Our findings indicate that RPK118 is a PRDX3-binding protein that may be involved in transporting PRDX3 from the cytoplasm to its mitochondrial site of function or to other membrane structures via endosome trafficking.",

ARHT may be involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis. Constitutively active mutants of ARHT1 induced an aggregation of the mitochondrial network and resulted in an increased apoptotic rate of the cells. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel mouse cDNA encoding a putative atypical GTPase protein, Arht2. Mouse Arht2 consists of 19 exons and has been mapped to mouse chromosome 17A3.3. Both human and mouse Arht2 genes are ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues. The results of RT-PCR experiments indicated that the Arht2 gene is expressed in all stages of mouse testis and reached the adult level of transcription at postnatal day 30. In situ hybridization revealed strong hybridization signals of Arht2 in residual bodies. In the mouse testis, Arht2 may be involved in the differentiation of testis and spermiogenesis. The molecular characterization of the mouse Arht2 gene may provide a clue for functional studies of the human ARHT genes.",

Then, the molecular chain structure, crystallinity, hydrophilicity and cell compatibility of the modified scaffolds were investigated by means of FT-IR, XRD, dynamic contact angle measurement and cell compatibility test. The results show that the addition of starch with proper dosage may decrease the crystallinity and improve the hydrophilicity and cell compatibility of the scaffolds, and that the scaffold with a starch dosage of 30% is of the best cell adhesion, proliferation and activity, which promises to be applied to bone tissue engineering.",

The relationship between torque variation and phase transition was used to study the mechanisms of starch gelatinization under shear stress, and to design the optimum extrusion conditions. The results showed that DSC was able to detect a certain degree of gelatinization enthalpy, even after birefringence had disappeared. Crown Copyright © 2007.",

        "abstract": "Human zinc finger protein 191 (ZNF191/ZNF24) was cloned and characterized as a SCAN family member, which shows 94% identity to its mouse homologue zinc finger protein 191 (Zfp191). ZNF191 can specifically interact with an intronic polymorphic TCAT repeat (HUMTH01) in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene. Allelic variations of HUMTH01 have been stated to have a quantitative silencing effect on TH gene expression and to correlate with quantitative and qualitative changes in the binding by ZNF191. Zfp191 is widely expressed during embryonic development and in multiple tissues and organs in adult. To investigate the functions of Zfp191 in vivo, we have used homologous recombination to generate mice that are deficient in Zfp191. Heterozygous Zfp191(+/-) mice are normal and fertile. Homozygous Zfp191(-/-) embryos are severely retarded in development and die at approximately 7.5 days post-fertilization. Unexpectedly, in Zfp191(-/-) and Zfp191(+/-) embryos, TH gene expression is not affected. Blastocyst outgrowth experiments and the RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ZNF191 in cultured cells revealed an essential role for Zfp191 in cell proliferation. In further agreement with this function, no viable Zfp191(-/-) cell lines were obtained by derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells from blastocysts of Zfp191(+/-) intercrosses or by forced homogenotization of heterozygous ES cells at high concentrations of G418. These data show that Zfp191 is indispensable for early embryonic development and cell proliferation.",

Phage SM701 was examined in electron microscope. The genome of SM701 was extracted and the size of its nucleic acid was identified with restriction enzyme analysis. Phage isolated was subjected to plaque forming unit (PFU) assay using double layer agar medium plate method and morphological properties of plaque was observed, and finally optimal MOI multiplicity of infection and one-step growth experiments were carried out.Phage SM701 specific to Serratia marcescens (8039) was isolated successfully from the raw sewage. SM701 had an isometric polyhedral head (about 64 nm in diameter) and a long noncontractile tail (about 143 nm long). The nucleic acid could be cut off by dsDNA restriction enzyme BamH I or HindIII and its complete size was about 57kb. The plaque of SM701 was transparent about 1mm in diameter at the 12th hour. When MOI equaled 10, the number of phage offspring was higher. One-stepgrowth kinetics was determined according to the results of one-step growth experiment, which showed that the latent period was about 30 min, the rise period was about 100 min, and the average bust size was about 63 pfu/cell.Phage SM701 belonged to tailed family: siphoviridae and lytic bacteriophage. It was quite easy to observe and count the plaques due to existing color differences between lytic and nonlytic zone.",

        "abstract": "Reservoir heterogeneity is the main cause of high water production and low oil recovery in oilfields. Extreme heterogeneity results in a serious fingering phenomenon of the displacing fluid in high permeability channels. To enhance total oil recovery, the selective plugging of high permeability zones and the resulting improvement of sweep efficiency of the displacing fluids in low permeability areas are important. Recently, a Branched Preformed Particle Gel (B-PPG) was developed to improve reservoir heterogeneity and enhance oil recovery. In this work, conformance control performance and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) ability of B-PPG in heterogeneous reservoirs were systematically investigated, using heterogeneous dual sandpack flooding experiments. The results show that B-PPG can effectively plug the high permeability sandpacks and cause displacing fluid to divert to the low permeability sandpacks. The water injection profile could be significantly improved by B-PPG treatment. B-PPG exhibits good performance in profile control when the high/low permeability ratio of the heterogeneous dual sandpacks is less than 7 and the injected B-PPG slug size is between 0.25 and 1.0 PV. The oil recovery increment enhanced by B-PPG after initial water flooding increases with the increase in temperature, sandpack heterogeneity and injected B-PPG slug size, and it decreases slightly with the increase of simulated formation brine salinity. Choosing an appropriate B-PPG concentration is important for B-PPG treatments in oilfield applications. B-PPG is an efficient flow diversion agent, it can significantly increase sweep efficiency of displacing fluid in low permeability areas, which is beneficial to enhanced oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs.",

        "abstract": "This article is one of the serial studies on the characteristics of the molecular structure for dystrophin gene in Chinese. By using the entire dystrophin cDNA (14 kb) as a probe, the number and RFLPs of Bgl II exon-containing fragments of the dystrophin gene were analysed. Four new Bgl II fragments were found, two of them (3.7 and 6.2 kb) detected by comparing the hybridization patterns with cDNA1–2a, la and 2a, one (9.3 kb) from the hybridization pattern with cDNA 9 by lengthening migrating distance of DNA fragments in electrophoresis , and another one (4.0 kb) by comparing the patterns with cDNA 11–14, 11a, 11b, 11c-12a and 14. The results indicated that the number of Bgl II exon-containing fragments should be 59 rather than 55 reported previously, which laid the foundation of the Bgl II partial restriction map for dystrophingene. Three of the four RFLPs found in Caucacian appear in the hybridization patterns of three subclones, i.e. cDNA 2b-3, cDNA 4–5, and cDNA 5b-7.The values of expected heterozygote frequency (EHF) were 0.33, 0.33 and 0.40, and the observed heterozygote frequency (OHF) were 0.40, 0.40 and 0.48 respectively. Meanwhile, two new rare allelic fragments (15 kb) were found in RFLPs from Bgl II/2b-3 and Bgl II/4–5a patterns respectively. These Bgl II RFLPs and four XbaI RFLPs documented in our laboratory have been used to detect the carrier in 7 DMD families and 1 BMD family. Of the 69 individuals from the 8 families, 11 females were diagnosed as the carriers with DMD mutation, 4 females as the doubtful carriers, 12 females were defined as normal genotype and 2 females as probably normal. The results suggest that the carrier testing method based on dosage intensity analysis and genotype analysis by using dystrophin cDNA as a probe will be more sensitive and accurate.",

        "abstract": "A cDNA encoding the epsilon subunit of human ATP synthase, ATP5E, was isolated from heart, skeletal muscle and spleen cDNA libraries respectively. Its genome structure was characterized as comprising three exons and two introns within a stretch of 5 kb, according to the genomic sequence AL109840. The gene was mapped to human chromosome 20q13.3 between marker D20S173 and 20qter using the radiation hybrid GB4 panel. Northern blot analysis showed that the ATP5E gene was expressed as a single 0.6 kb transcript in all 16 human tissues tested, with a high level present in heart and skeletal muscle. A new conserved motif composed of 24 residues, termed the ATP5E motif [W(R/K)X(5)YX(2)(Y/F)X(3)(C/A)X(4)RX(3)K], was defined on the basis of sequences of ATP synthase epsilon subunits from ten different organisms. In addition, a pseudogene ATP5EP1 was also identified on the basis of genomic sequence AC004066, localized on human chromosome 4q25. By analysing these results combined with the Southern blot patterns of human DNA hybridized with bovine ATP5E cDNA reported previously [Vinas, Powell, Runswick, Iacobazzi and Walker (1990) Biochem. J. 265, 321-326], we provide evidence of yet further homologous sequences (either gene or pseudogene) of ATP5E, in addition to ATP5E and ATP5EP1 in the human genome.",

The PCR result of each cell line of the panel was scored in a certain way and put into the related internet site of WI/MIT Radiation Hybrid Mapper for RH mapping and comprehensive analysis.The H-RalGDS gene was successfully localized to the framework of chromosome 9. After referring to literature and further integrated mapping analysis of the physical, genetic linkage and cytological mappings, the gene was assigned precisely between the markers SURF5 and RPL7A which had already been assigned to human chromosome 9q34.1.The localization of H-RalGDS not only contributed much to the construction of refined gene map and cytogenetic map within the region of chromosome 9q34, but also made clear that RH mapping of human novel genes is a simple, convenient and reliable method which can provide even more genetic information of genes within chromosomal regions.",

        "abstract": "The Gadd45 family of proteins, which includes alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms, has recently been shown to play a role in the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint in response to DNA damage; however, the mechanisms by which Gadd45 proteins inhibit cell cycle control are not fully understood. Using immunohistochemical analysis, we found that protein expression of Gadd45gamma, but not Gadd45alpha, was down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. We thus investigated possible mechanisms by which Gadd45alpha and Gadd45gamma might differentially induce G2/M arrest in the human hepatoma Hep-G2 cell line. Flow cytometric analysis revealed significant G2/M arrest in cells transfected with either Gadd45alpha or Gadd45gamma. Importantly, we found that expression of either Gadd45alpha or Gadd45gamma activated the P38 and JNK kinase pathways to induce G2/M arrest. Taken together, these findings suggest that the induction of G2/M arrest by Gadd45alpha or Gadd45gamma involves activation of two distinct signaling pathways in Hep-G2 hepatoma cell lines.",

A similar form of copper-associated cirrhosis caused by mutations of the canine copper toxicosis MURR1 gene is also observed in Bedlington terriers. Recent studies indicate that MURR1 might influence human copper metabolism and the clinical presentations of WD. However, the correlation between the MURR1 gene and the Chinese patients with WD has not been reported. In the present study, all three exons of the MURR1 gene including the intron–exon boundaries were directly sequenced in 120 unrelated healthy Chinese and 218 unrelated Chinese patients with WD. No mutations were detected in coding and splice site sequence in the human MURR1 gene. A novel polymorphism 3′+119T→A in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) was identified in three healthy individuals and four patients with two disease-causing mutations in the ATP7B gene and a great diversity of clinical presentations. Of the ATP7B mutations reported here, Gly1268Arg is a novel one. Also, the previously described nucleotide change IVS2+63C→G was detected in 31.66% of normal chromosomes and 26.15% of WD chromosomes. The results have indicated that there is no correlation between MURR1 and WD in the Chinese population.",

        "abstract": "ARF suppresses aberrant cell growth upon c-Myc overexpression by activating p53 responses. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which ARF specifically restrains the oncogenic potential of c-Myc without affecting its normal physiological function is not well understood. Here, we show that low levels of c-Myc expression stimulate cell proliferation, whereas high levels inhibit by activating the ARF/p53 response. Although the mRNA levels of ARF are induced in both scenarios, the accumulation of ARF protein occurs only when ULF-mediated degradation of ARF is inhibited by c-Myc overexpression. Moreover, the levels of ARF are reduced through ULF-mediated ubiquitination upon DNA damage. Blocking ARF degradation by c-Myc overexpression dramatically stimulates the apoptotic responses. Our study reveals that ARF stability control is crucial for differentiating normal (low) versus oncogenic (high) levels of c-Myc expression and suggests that differential effects on ULF- mediated ARF ubiquitination by c-Myc levels act as a barrier in oncogene-induced stress responses.",

Survival analysis was used to confirm underlying prognostic indicators. : In the present study, we constructed a ceRNA network based on 16 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 7 differentially expressed microRNAs and 34 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DELs). Among these dysregulated RNAs, three DELs (AP002478.1, HTR2A-AS1, and ERVMER61-1) and six DEGs (enhancer of zeste homolog 2 [], kinesin family member 23 [], chromobox 2 [], centrosomal protein 55 [], cell division cycle 25A [], and claspin []) were used for construct a prognostic signature for HCC overall survival (OS), and performed well in HCC OS (adjusted <0.0001, adjusted hazard ratio = 2.761, 95% confidence interval = 1.838-4.147). Comprehensive survival analysis demonstrated that this prognostic signature may be act as an independent prognostic indicator of HCC OS. Functional assessment of these dysregulated DEGs in the ceRNA network and gene set enrichment of this prognostic signature suggest that both were enriched in the biological processes and pathways of the cell cycle, cell division and cell proliferation. : Our current study constructed a ceRNA network for HCC, and developed a prognostic signature that may act as an independent indicator for HCC OS.",

In the present study, following clone and location of human GADD45 gamma (MyDL) gene, we have found that its mRNA expression level was down-regulated in 15/23 cases of clinic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by comparing the northern hybridization results between the tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Transient transfection of GADD45 gamma cDNA with intact open reading frame sequence into the human hepatoma cells Hep-G2 resulted in dramatic growth suppression in colony formation assays. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis indicated that GADD45 y caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M transition when transfected into Hep-G2 cells. Therefore, the possible role of GADD45 gamma in cell growth control was further confirmed in this paper.",

For starch-SAPs synthesized by a twin-roll mixer using starches from three botanical origins, a reduced grid size and an increased fractal gel size on nano-scale (i.e., increased stretch of 3D network) contributed to increasing the water absorbing capacity with a reduced absorbing rate and thus improving the slow-release property of fertilizer. The fertilizer particles coated with starch-SAP displayed well slow-release behaviors. In soil, compared to urea particles without and with EC coating, the particles further coated with starch-SAP showed reduced nitrogen release rate, and in particular, those with potato starch-SAP coating exhibited a steady release behavior for a period longer than 96h. Therefore, this work has demonstrated the potential of this new slow-release fertilizer system for improving the effectiveness of fertilizers.",

        "abstract": "PurposeA large, uneven settlement that is unfavourable to dam safety can occur between a concrete cut-off wall and the high-plasticity clay of earth core dam built on alluviums. This issue has been often studied using the small-strain finite element (FE) method in previous research. This paper aims to research the interaction behaviour between a concrete cut-off wall and high-plasticity clay using large-deformation FE analyses.Design/methodology/approachThe re-meshing and interpolation technique with a small-strain (RITSS) method was performed using an independently developed program and adopted for large-deformation FE analyses, and a suitable element size for the high-plasticity clay region was suggested. The layered construction process of an earth core dam built on thick alluviums was simulated using the RITSS method incorporating a hyperbolic model for soil.FindingsThe RITSS method is an effective technique for simulating the soil–structure interaction during dam construction. The RITSS analysis predicted a higher maximum principle stress of the concrete cut-off wall and higher stress levels in the high-plasticity clay region than small-strain FE analysis.Originality/valueA practical method for large-deformation FE analysis was advised and was used for the first time to study the interaction between a concrete cut-off wall and high-plasticity clay in dam engineering. Large deformation in the high-plasticity clay was handled using the RITSS method. Moreover, the penetration process of the concrete cut-off wall into the high-plasticity clay was captured using a favourable element shape and mesh density.",

        "abstract": "Utilizing laser and camera for track geometry inspection, calibration approach for laser photogrammetric transducers is a key issue. The calibration models constructed by the nonlinear least-square method and Gaussian-Newton optimization computational method are presented respectively. The transducer measurement models parameters are acquired by the above-mentioned approaches making use of 200 individual data in the checkerboard plane by the dedicated test platform. Moreover, the other 200 individual data are added for different algorithms calibration errors analysis. The experimental results show that Gaussian-Newton algorithm is more accurate than the nonlinear least-square algorithm in camera calibration. The horizontal and vertical accuracy can improve 1.55 mm and 1.50 mm by use of Gaussian-Newton algorithm. While using laser photogrammetric transducers in track inspection vehicle, Gaussian-Newton calibration algorithm is proposed. Track gauge and bogie tilting angle computational formulations are given by Gaussian-Newton algorithm in the track inspection system. ©2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

        "abstract": "The gelatinization process of waxy corn starch under different pressures up to 10.0 MPa was investigated using a high pressure DSC. Compressed air and carbon dioxide were used as pressure resources. Effect of pressure and annealing under pressure on gelatinization of waxy corn starch was systematically studied, in particular on the gelatinization temperature and enthalpy. The results show that the peak temperature of gelatinization was increased slightly initially then remained stable with increasing pressure. The gelatinization enthalpy was decreased under pressure processing. Annealing the starch under pressure condition, just below its gelatinization temperature, increased gelatinization temperature but kept gelatinized enthalpy constant. Morphologies of starch granules treated under pressure were studied using an optical microscope and SEM. There is no discernable difference of starch granules treated with and without pressure, which indicates the pressures are not high enough to destroy crystalline structure. The intensity of the pressure acts as a key factor to influence the gelatinization of starch rather than the nature of the gas. Effect of pressure on the multi-endotherm detected by DSC for starch with intermediate water is used to study the mechanisms. The effect of pressure can be explained by the enhancement of water diffusion in the amorphous range.",

Complementation analysis showed the Dhm1 gene on a multicopy plasmid can rescue the temperature-sensitivity mutation of dhp1(ts) and the lethality of the dhp1 null mutation. This finding suggests that Dhm1 has a function in mouse similar to that of dhp1(+). The human homologue of this gene, XRN2, has been identified. A 3.6-kb transcript of XRN2 was detected in 16 tissues examined and was more abundant in testis. By radiation hybrid panel mapping, the XRN2 gene was localized to chromosome 20p11.1-p11.2 between markers D20S180 and D20S871.",

Immunofluorescence demonstrated that BRSK2 and VCP/p97 were co-localized and also that knockdown of endogenous BRSK2 induced increased levels of CD3δ, a substrate in ERAD for VCP/p97.

However, the underlying mechanism in tumorigenesis is remain elusive. The present study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism of biological function of HEY2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dysfunction of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway plays a critical role in HCC pathogenesis. Here, we identified HEY2 as a suppressor for TGF-β biological response. We demonstrated that HEY2 protein in tumor cytoplasm was up-regulated in HCC. Further, HEY2 overexpression inhibited TGF-β-induced growth arrest of HCC cells and inhibited TGF-β-induced downregulation of c-Myc, both in mRNA and in protein levels. While knockdown of HEY2, by small interfering RNA, was shown to enhance the TGF-β-mediated biological response of HCC cells. Moreover, HEY2 could form complexes with Smad3 and Smad4 and repress Smad3/Smad4 transcriptional activity. In conclusion, our findings indicate a novel role of HEY2 in mediating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in HCC tumorigenesis.",

        "abstract": "Similar to the translational system in the cell cytoplasm, the initiation, elongation, and termination of protein synthesis in the mitochondria of eukaryotes are catalyzed by several protein factors. These factors, from the viewpoint of evolution, are more closely related to the corresponding prokaryotic factors than to those in the eukaryotic cytoplasm. In this paper, we isolated two cDNAs coding for human and mouse mitochondrial elongation factor G (GFM and Gfm, respectively). The GFM cDNA, which is 3481 bp in length, predicts a protein of 751 amino acids sharing 84 and 42% identity and 88 and 62% similarity to rat EF-G(mt) and Escherichia coli EF-G, respectively, and 24% identity and 39% similarity to human EF-2, the equivalent of EF-G in the cytoplasm. The mouse Gfm cDNA is 2564 bp and contains an intact open reading frame that encodes 751 amino acids showing 89% sequence identity and 94% similarity to human GFM. Northern blot analysis of human GFM revealed three transcripts of 3.8, 3.4, and 2.9 kb. The first two were expressed at high levels in heart, skeletal muscle, and testis, at moderate levels in liver and kidney, and at low levels in other tissues including brain, placenta, and lung, while the last transcript was expressed only in testis. The relative abundance of GFM was consistent with the observations for human EF-Tu(mt) and EF-Ts(mt), the other two mitochondrial elongation factors, indicating that the three factors were expressed at corresponding levels. The expression pattern of mouse Gfm was also determined, which showed that Gfm was expressed as a 3.0-kb transcript, abundantly in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis. In addition, GFM was assigned to human chromosome 3q25.1-q26.2 by the radiation hybrid mapping method. The genomic organization of GFM was also analyzed by comparing this cDNA with a genomic DNA sequence (Accession No. AC010936), which showed that GFM contained 18 exons and spanned at least 40 kb.",

        "abstract": "Members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily have significant roles in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological processes. In our present work, phylogenetic tree analysis showed that human GDF3 (Growth and differentiation factor 3) and human GDF1 formed a subgroup of closely related molecules. Through quantitative real-time PCR analysis in different human tissues, GDF1 and GDF3 expression level had a big difference in brain. GDF3 could activate downstream signaling through associating with ALK7 (Activin receptor-like kinase 7) in a Cripto-dependent fashion. A CHO cell line stably transfected with the encoding sequence of GDF3, named CHO-GDF3, was established. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that GDF3 protein could be secreted into the medium from CHO cells and immunofluorescence experiment showed that GDF3 was mainly distributed in cytoplasm of the stable cell line, the primary hippocampal neurons, and brain tissues. Furthermore, the conditioned medium from CHO-GDF3 could reduce PC12 cell growth and induce cell differentiation. All these findings bring new insights into the functional study of GDF3.",

In this paper, a prediction based dynamic update grid scheduling approach is presented. In this approach, grid scheduler utilizes recent resource performance data, such as computer's load, latency of net communicating to calculate and predict the coming performance of grid resources, then the tasks are submitted to the low load resource. Comparing this dynamic grid scheduling approach with some other research, this approach is more generous than other scheduling approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach diminishes latency and contributes to the overall grid load balancing, and therefore significantly improves resource utilization , response time of tasks and shorten execution time using the performance prediction versus a random selection of resources.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of hepatoma is high in the Chinese population. Searching for genes involved in the functions of the liver, especially genes specifically expressed in the liver, will facilitate an insight into the molecular basis of normal and abnormal liver functions. Based on a differentially displayed cDNA fragment, which was down regulated in hepatoma tissues, we cloned a novel cDNA of 957 bp, TCP10L (T-complex protein 10 like), from the human liver cDNA library. Northern hybridization of this novel gene in 30 adult human tissues was examined. The result revealed that TCP10L expressed specifically in the human liver and testis. The TCP10L contains a 645-bp open reading frame encoding a deduced protein of 215 amino acids. As the deduced protein was analyzed further, a typical leucine zipper motif was found. We firstly examined the transcriptional function of the TCP10L protein by transfecting recombinant pM-TCP10L into mammalian cells. The subsequent analysis based on the dual luciferase assay system showed that TCP10L significantly inhibited the expression of reporter genes. Compared with that of the negative control, the luciferase activity were down regulated in HEK293 and SK-HEP-1, CHO cells by about 2.6, 9.8, and 5.5 folds respectively. A mutated type of TCP10L was also constructed. It showed that the repression of TCP10L to the expression of the reporter gene almost completely decreased, suggesting that the leucine zipper structure is critical for TCP10L to play its role in regulation function. Then we transfected the recombinant TCP10L-EGFP into cells. The results indicated that TCP10L subcellularly located in nuclei, either in HEK 293 or SK-HEP-1 cells. In addition, human TCP10L was found comprised of five exons and four introns, and mapped to chromosome 21q22.11.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lath martensitic steels possess excellent mechanical properties because of the special microstructure, i.e. laths, blocks and packets with particular crystallography in a prior austenite grain. To theoretically analyze the mechanical behavior of lath martensitic steels, a hierarchical model is proposed combining the crystal plasticity theory and micromechanical method. Within the crystal plasticity theory, an interfacial dislocation model is proposed at the block level to physically describe the effect of lath boundary on the deformation behavior. Furthermore, The scale transition among block, prior austenite grain and lath martensitic steel is accomplished by the elastic-viscoplastic self consistent theory. Based on the proposed model, the deformation behavior of lath martensitic steel with hierarchical structures has been theoretically analyzed. It is revealed that the deformation anisotropy of prior austenite grain is weak due to the particular crystallography of microstructures, and the influence of temperature on yield stress is dominated by the thermally related intrinsic lattice friction and elastic modulus. Moreover, the hierarchical model is generalized to study the mechanical behavior of irradiated lath martensitic steel, and it is found that the change of temperature has a limited effect on the irradiation hardening behavior, and the increase of yield stress induced by irradiation-induced defects can accelerate the evolution rate of dislocation density. Numerical results with/without irradiation effect can both match well with corresponding experimental data, indicating the good accuracy and rationality of the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "The present work reported the cloning and characterization of two novel human genes--HN1 (hematopoietic- and neurologic-expressed sequence 1) and HN1L (HN1-like gene) which are proposed to be involved in embryo development. HN1 is mapped on chromosome 17q25.2, with two transcripts (1.0 and 1.6 kb in length, respectively) due to alternative splicing. HN1 is expressed abundantly in testis and skeletal muscle among 16 human tissues, and it is localized in the nucleus indicated by GFP fusion expression. Western blot confirmed that HN1 encodes a 16.5-kDa protein. HN1L is on chromosome 16p13.3, with three splicing in the length of 2.0, 4.0 and 4.2 kb, respectively. HN1L is expressed in a variety of tissues such as liver, kidney, prostate, testis and uterus at varying levels. HN1L gene encodes a 20-kDa protein, which is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Fourteen of HN1 and sixteen of HN1L homologous genes in different species were determined and analyzed by BLAST searches. Silicon analyses of the 14 orthologous proteins of HN1 and 16 orthologous proteins of HN1L revealed that they share great conservation in vertebrate. Additionally, we identified nine pseudogenes of HN1 (six) and HN1L (three) in the genomes of the human, mouse and rat. Based on sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis, all these homologous genes and pseudogenes were defined as a HN1 gene family.",

        "title": "Carbonyl reductase 1 as a novel target of (2)-epigallocatechin gallate against hepatocellular carcinoma",
        "abstract": "Human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) converts the antitumor drug and anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR) into the alcohol metabolite daunorubicinol (DNROL) with significantly reduced antitumor activity and cardiotoxicity, and this limits the clinical use of DNR. Inhibition of CBR1 can thus increase the efficacy and decrease the toxicity of DNR. Here we report that (2)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea is a promising inhibitor of CBR1. EGCG directly interacts with CBR1 and acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to the cofactor reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and the substrate isatin. The inhibition is dependent on the pH, and the gallate moiety of EGCG is required for activity. Molecular modeling has revealed that EGCG occupies the active site of CBR1. Furthermore, EGCG specifically enhanced the antitumor activity of DNR against hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC7721 cells expressing high levels of CBR1 and corresponding xenografts. We also demonstrated that EGCG could overcome the resistance to DNR by Hep3B cells stably expressing CBR1 but not by RNA interference of CBR1-HepG2 cells. The level of the metabolite DNROL was negatively correlated with that of EGCG in the cell extracts. Finally, EGCG decreased the cardiotoxicity of DNR in a human carcinoma xenograft model with both SMMC7721 and Hep3B cells in mice. Conclusion: These results strongly suggest that EGCG can inhibit CBR1 activity and enhance the effectiveness and decrease the cardiotoxicity of the anticancer drug DNR. These findings also indicate that a combination of EGCG and DNR might represent a novel approach for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy or chemoprevention.

Human EFCBP1 encodes a 351 amino acid protein containing two EF-hand motifs and an antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase (ABM) domain, sharing 49.9 and 56.8% global homology with human EFCBP2 and EFCBP3. Northern hybridization revealed that EFCBP1 is specifically expressed in brain and its abundance varies in different brain regions. EFCBP1's abundance in temporal lobe, frontal lobe and occipital pole is about 3.4, 1.9 and 1.5 folds of the average abundance in cerebral cortex, respectively. The expression level of EFCBP1 equals in putamen and cerebral cortex, while no hybridization signal was detected in spinal cord. In addition, we found that EFCBP1, EFCBP2 and EFCBP3 share a similar exon distribution mode, though their chromosomal localizations, genomic sizes and intron sizes are diverse.",

The model is based on the derivation of an average defect density within the formed plasticity affected region, which depends on the distribution of defect density in the irradiated region, indentation depth and distance from the irradiated sample surface. A succinct parameter calibration process is proposed by comparing the theoretical results with experimental data at a given indentation depth. A good agreement with experimental data can be achieved for both the fitted relationship between irradiation hardening and indentation distance from the irradiated sample surface under cross-sectional nanoindentation, and predicted hardness as a function of indentation depth under surface nanoindentation. Therefore, the rationality and accuracy of the proposed model are effectively verified. Based on the analysis of this proposed model, it is available to characterize the property of plasticity affected region and irradiation depth of ion-irradiated materials based on the experimental data measured through cross-sectional nanoindentation.",

Recent studies by different research groups have shown that RLIM acts as an X-encoded, dose-dependent inducer of X chromosome inactivation in mouse embryonic stem cells. However, until now, very little is known about the expression regulation of RLIM gene, and we tried to study the transcriptional regulation of RLIM gene. In the present study, we identified RLIM as a novel target of p53 and demonstrated that p53 repressed both mRNA and protein levels of RLIM. Expression of wild type p53, but not p53 mutants, led to repression of the RLIM promoter activity. We further identified four putative Sp1 elements (S1 to S4) on the RLIM promoter that are essential for p53-mediated repression of RLIM. Although p53 does not directly bind to the RLIM promoter, it physically interacts with and prevents the binding of Sp1 to the RLIM promoter. Thus, RLIM is a novel target of p53, and p53 exerts its inhibitory effect on RLIM expression by interfering with Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation on RLIM. Our results provided data to enlarge the knowledge of transcriptional regulation of RLIM and suggested a new pathway by which physiological and pathological activators of p53 may affect development.",

A single nucleotide polymorphism in murine double minute 2 promoter, SNP309 T>G, has been reported to alter murine double minute 2 protein expression and to accelerate tumor formation in humans. We carried out a meta-analysis to explore the association between this polymorphism and prostate cancer risk.All eligible studies were searched in PubMed. Crude odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were assessed for the association using fixed- and random-effects models.Overall, five case-control studies (872 cases, 1005 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. A significant association between murine double minute 2 SNP309 and prostate cancer risk was observed for homozygote genetic model GG versus TT (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.95, P < 0.05, P = 0.130 for heterogeneity), and for dominant model TG + GG versus TT (odds ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.96, P < 0.05, P = 0.119 for heterogeneity). The stratified analysis based on ethnicity showed a significant effect of the polymorphism on prostate cancer risk in Caucasians for GG versus TT.Findings of the present meta-analysis suggest that the murine double minute 2 309 G allele might be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. The effect of murine double minute 2 309 G allele on tumorigenesis might be influenced by sex and hormonal status.",

In addition,melt strain (detected by velocity) was increased by chain extension,blending with elastomer, and plasticizing, but was decreasedby crosslinking. The molecular weights, thermal propertiesand viscosity of the modified PLAs were also studied toinvestigate the causes of the observed variations in meltstrength. Viscosity results generally corresponded with that ofmelt strength, but not with that of melt strain. With the exceptionof plasticizing and nucleation, the modifications had nosignificant effect on the thermal properties of PLA. The molecularweight (in particular the extremely large molecules representingby Mz) and the polydispersity of PLA were significantlyincreased after crosslinking and chain extension, whichaccounts for the observed increase in melt strength. © Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH and Co.

        "abstract": "Pre-transfer editing pathway in Valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) is a very important process to maintain the high fidelity of protein synthesis. However, molecular basis for this pathway remains unclear. Here we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study two complexes, ValRS·tRNA(val)·Val-AMP (complex V) and ValRS·tRNA(val)·Thr-AMP (complex T), and compared their simulation trajectories, in order to understand how the pre-transfer editing pathway is triggered by the noncognate substrate Thr-AMP. The MD simulations showed that the binding of Thr-AMP to ValRS led to different motions from those in complex V: clockwise rotation of the editing domain along the hinge region, and strong motions in the catalytic domain, especially in KMSKS loop. We found that the changed motion of Trp495 induced by Thr-AMP serves as a signal to discriminate Thr-AMP from Val-AMP, and the rigid (491)ILFL(494) segment then propagates this signal from Trp495 to Asp490 and induces dissociation of the salt-bridge Asp490-Arg346 and formation of the salt-bridge Glu189-Lys533. The change in salt-bridges alters the motion of KMSKS loop and the editing domain, and eventually triggers the pre-transfer editing pathway. This study provides a model for the molecular trigger of the pre-transfer editing pathway in ValRS, and is useful for further exploring this process.",

        "abstract": "The Prolyl hydroxylase 1 (EGLN2) is known to affect tumorigenesis by regulating the degradation of hypoxiainducible factor. Polymorphisms in EGLN2 may facilitate cancer cell survival under hypoxic conditions and directly associate with cancer susceptibility. Here, we examined the contribution of a 4-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs10680577) within the distal promoter of EGLN2 to the risk of hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese populations. The contribution of rs10680577 to HCC risk was investigated in 623 HCC cases and 1,242 controls and replicated in an independent case-control study consisting of 444 HCC cases and 450 controls. Logistic regression analysis showed that the deletion allele of rs10680577 was significantly associated with increased risk for HCC occurrence in both case-control studies [OR = 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-1.66, P < 0.0001; OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.18-1.88, P = 0.0007]. Such positive association was more pronounced in current smokers (OR = 3.49, 95% CI = 2.24-5.45) than nonsmokers (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.03-1.50; heterogeneity P = 0.0002). Genotype-phenotype correlation studies showed that the deletion allele was significantly correlated with higher expression of both EGLN2 and RERT-lncRNA [a long noncoding RNA whose sequence overlaps with Ras-related GTP-binding protein 4b (RAB4B) and EGLN2)] in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, RERT-lncRNA expression was also significantly correlated with EGLN2 expression in vivo, consistent with in vitro gain-offunction study that showed overexpressing RERT-lncRNA upregulated EGLN2. Finally, in silico prediction suggested that the insertion allele could disrupt the structure of RERT-lncRNA. Taken together, our findings provided strong evidence for the hypothesis that rs10680577 contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis, possibly by affecting RERT-lncRNA structure and subsequently EGLN2 expression, making it a promising biomarker for early diagnosis of HCC. ©2012 AACR.",

While much progress has been made assembling nanocrystals into different superlattices, controlling the relative orientations of nanocrystals in those lattices remains a challenge. Here, we combine experiments with computer simulations to study the self-assembly of 'patchy' heterostructural nanocrystals (HNCs), consisting of near-spherical quantum dots decorated with regular arrangements of small gold satellites, into close-packed superlattices with pronounced orientational alignment of HNCs. Our simulations indicate that the orientational alignment is caused by van der Waals interactions between gold patches and is sensitive to the interparticle distance in the superlattice. We demonstrate experimentally that the degree and type of orientational alignment can be controlled by changing ligand populations on HNCs. This study provides guidance for the design and fabrication of nanocrystal superlattices with enhanced structural control.",

        "abstract": "The retinoblastoma gene Rb is a prototype tumor suppressor which is conserved in Drosophila. Although much is known about the roles of Rb in cell proliferation and apoptosis, much less is known about how Rb regulates cell differentiation. Inactivation of Drosophila Rb (rbf) exhibited subtle differentiation defects similar to inactivation of Rb in mice, suggesting the existence of redundant mechanisms in the control of cell differentiation. To test this possibility and to characterize the role of Rbf in cell differentiation during retinal development, we carried out a genetic screen and identified a mutation in rhinoceros (rno), which leads to synergistic differentiation defects in conjunction with rbf inactivation. Characterization of an early differentiation defect, the multiple-R8 phenotype, revealed that this phenotype was caused by limiting amounts of Notch signaling due to reduced expression of the Notch ligand, Delta (Dl). Decreasing the gene dosage of Dl enhanced the multiple-R8 phenotype, while increasing the level of Dl suppressed this phenotype. Interestingly, removal of the transcriptional activation of dE2F1 partially restores Dl expression in rbf,rno mutant clones and suppresses the associated differentiation defects, indicating that this differentiation function of RBF is mediated by its regulation of dE2F1 activity.",

        "abstract": "This work investigates the rheology, structure, and properties of novel thermal/cooling-gel biphasic systems formed by hybridization of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as a thermal gel and hydroxypropyl starch (HPS) as a cooling gel. Due to the different gelation properties, HPS became the dispersed phase in the other continuous phase at low temperatures, and so did HPMC at high temperatures. However, the dispersed phase could play a dominant role in the viscosity, thixotropy, and gel properties of the blends, and subsequently affect the crystalline structure, fractal structure, mechanical properties, oxygen permeability, and thermal stability of the blend films. Moreover, the rheological properties and the film structure and performance could also be varied by the chemical modification of starch. Hydroxypropylation could break the starch intermolecular hydrogen bonding, disrupt its ordered structure, inhibit the molecular rearrangement, and result in a softer gel texture that was more compatible with HPMC. With a higher degree of hydroxypropyl substitution, the resultant blend films were more amorphous and flexible but exhibited decreased mechanical properties and oxygen permeability. The knowledge obtained from this work could provide guidance to further developing various thermal/cooling-gel multi-phasic systems with desired properties and functionality.",

        "abstract": "The human zinc finger protein ZNF191 is a krüppel-like transcription factor, which may be relevant to many diseases such as neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular and liver caner diseases. To elucidate the function of ZNF191 by gene targeting, it is necessary to clone and characterize of the homologous gene in model organisms (mice). The mouse homologous gene (ZF-12) was cloned and sequenced for the first time, the GenBank accession number is AY052495. It contains four exons and three introns; all intronic splice sites exhibited consensus GT/AG sequences. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 2 and the alternative length of 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) have been found. The linkage of the ZF-12 gene and the zinc finger protein gene Zfp-35 has been found, so the ZF-12 gene can be localized to B3 to C or beside of chromosome 18. We assessed approximately 1.2 kb of 5'-flanking region of the ZF-12 gene for basal promoter activity. A series of deletion mutants of 5'-flanking region linked to the luciferase gene was constructed. Basal level expression of these constructs was tested in COS-7 cells, NIH3T3 cells and HeLa cells. By measuring luciferase activity, which was transiently expressed in the transfected cells, we found that regulatory elements sufficient for basal expression lie between -762 and +70 bp relative to the transcription start site and that a negative regulatory region lie between -824 and -762 bp. This research provides a basis for further study on ZF-12 by gene targeting.",

        "abstract": "IL-2 is one of the most important cytokines required for T cell-mediated immune responses. Costimulation of CD28 in T cells up-regulates IL-2 mRNA levels via transcription activation and mRNA stabilization. Upon T cell activation, NF90, an AU-rich element (ARE)-binding protein, translocates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it binds to the ARE-containing 3' untranslated regions of IL-2 mRNA and slows down degradation of IL-2 mRNA. The translocation of NF90 is mediated through a nuclear export signal at its N terminus, but how it is triggered is still unclear. Phosphorylation of ARE-binding proteins has been reported as a signal transduction pathway to stabilize ARE-containing transcripts. In this study, we demonstrate that AKT phosphorylates NF90 on Ser647 upon CD28 costimulation. This phosphorylation is necessary for nuclear export of NF90 and IL-2 mRNA stabilization by this protein, because a mutation at Ser647 abolished both functions. We observed that treatment of cells with CD28 costimulation induced distinct increase in phosphorylation of AKT and NF90 at Ser647 concomitantly. Phosphorylation at Ser647 of NF90 up-regulated IL-2 production in response to CD28 costimulation. In vivo and in vitro data support a model in which CD28 costimulation activates AKT to phosphorylate NF90 at Ser647 and phosphorylation triggers NF90 to relocate to the cytoplasm and stabilize IL-2 mRNA.",

        "abstract": "The rheological properties and phase transition of cornstarch with low moisture content under shear stress was investigated using a mixer with twin-roller rotors by the variation of torque as functions of temperature and time. Cornstarches with different AM/AP ratios (wx: 4:96, maize: 29:71, Gelose 50: 62:38, and Gelose 80: 77:23) were used as model materials in the experimental work. The results showed that, as the AM content increased from 0 to 77%, the maximum torque increased from about 54 to 66 N/m and the final torque increased from about 27 to 47 N/m, respectively, and a longer mixing time was required to achieve a stable state (constant torque value). Microscopic and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies showed that the phase transition reflected by changes of birefringence and endotherms could well be associated with the torque curve measured by the mixer. The higher gelatinization temperatures of the starches with higher AM content, and especially the existence of multi-phase transitions at high temperatures, could explain the rheological behaviors detected by the mixer. The technique can be used to study the starch melting and destructuration under shear stress with low moisture content (<45%), which represents the most of extrusion conditions for starch-based materials.

The classical C2H2 zinc finger proteins were the founding members of this superfamily and were among the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic genomes. C2H2 proteins typically contained several C2H2 fingers that made tandem contacts along the DNA. Here we reported a novel C2H2 type zinc finger gene, ZNF438, which encoded 828 amino acids that formed five zinc finger domains. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the ZNF438 was mapped to human chromosome 10p11.2 and shared 62% identity with rat and mouse homologues. RT-PCR analysis indicated that it was ubiquitously expressed in 18 human adult tissues. With immunofluorescence assay, it was shown that the exogenous Flag-tagged ZNF438 was located in nucleus of COS-7 cells. To further explore the function of ZNF438, we examined the transcriptional activity of ZNF438 protein by transfecting recombinant pM-ZNF438 into mammalian cells. The subsequent analysis based on the duel luciferase assay system showed that ZNF438 was a transcriptional repressor.",

The unique microstructure of starch and its multiphase transitions during thermal processing provide an outstanding model system to illustrate our conceptual approach to understanding the structure–processing–property relationships in polymers. One of the unique characteristics of starch-based polymers is their thermal processing properties, which are much more complex than conventional polymers, since multiple chemical and physical reactions may occur during processing, such as water diffusion, granular expansion, gelatinization, decomposition, melting and crystallization. Among these phase transitions, gelatinization is particularly important because it is closely related to the others, and it is the basis of the conversion of starch to a thermoplastic. Furthermore, the decomposition temperature of starch is higher than its melting temperature before gelatinization. Various conventional processing techniques such as extrusion, injection compression molding, and casting, as well as some new techniques such as reactive extrusion, have been adapted for processing starch-based polymers. The achievements in this area have increased our knowledge of polymer science, in particular that of natural polymers.",

        "abstract": "Type A receptors of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, contain alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and rho subunits. The gamma subunit has four subtypes: gamma1, gamma2, gamma3, andgamma4. GABA(A) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) was previously demonstrated to act as a linker protein between microtubules and the gamma2 subunit of GABA(A) receptors. However, no other linker proteins have been identified as mediating the linkage of microtubules and the remaining subunits of GABA(A) receptors. In this study we identified three human paralogues (GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2, and GABARAPL3) and two mouse orthologues (Gabarapl1 and Gabarapl2) of human GABARAP, all of which encoded 117 amino acids, as does Gabarapl. The expression patterns of GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2, and GABARAP in 16 adult tissues showed that they were expressed ubiquitously. The expression levels of GABARAPL1 as a 2.3-kb transcript were very high in brain, heart, peripheral blood leukocytes, liver, kidney, placenta, and skeletal muscle, very low in thymus and small intestine, and moderate in other tissues tested. The unique 1.35-kb transcript of GABARAPL2 was expressed at high levels in heart, brain, testis, prostate, ovary, spleen, and skeletal muscle, at very low levels in lung, thymus, and small intestine, and moderately in other tissues tested. For GABARAP, a 1.3-kb transcript was abundantly expressed in all tested tissues with small variation. The expression patterns of Gabarapl1 and Gabarapl2 were similar to those of their counterparts in human. In addition, GABARAPL1 was localized to human chromosome 12p12.3 and GABARAPL2 to 16q22.3-q24.1 by RH mapping, while GABARAP and GABARAPL3 were found to be localized at chromosomes 17p13.2 and 15q25.1, respectively, by searching the related databases. Sequence comparison of the cDNAs and their corresponding genomic sequences shows that GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2 are composed of four exons each, while GABARAPL3 is distributed only at one exon.",

Results showed that multi-scale structure of the blends were greatly affected by the plasticizers and therefore caused significant changes in mechanical properties. In the course, blends with glycerol presented lamellar structure rather than self-similar structure. Moreover, crystalline degree was increased with an order of glycerol > PEG > PG, whereas the compactness of amorphous region of all samples was decreased by PEG and PG.",

RalGDS can specifically promote the conversion from an inactive GDP-bound state to an active GTP-bound state for Ral. The cDNA of human RalGDS has been cloned recently. In this paper, by comparison between the gene's genomic and cDNA seqence, we determined the structure of the gene, which showed that the reported human RalGDS transcribed from 18 exons. Furthermore, a novel variant of RalGDS that codes for a protein with a different N-terminus was cloned and identified. Northern hybridization revealed that the novel transcript was of 6.0 kb in length while the transcript previously reported is of 4.0 kb. Both transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in human adult tissues examined, albeit with different amounts. In addition, this novel transcript was proved to be caused by employment of a new exon, designated as exon 1a, instead of the one, designated as exon 1b, in the reported cDNA. Thus, the RalGDS gene consists of at least 19 exons and spanned a 44 kb region. The length between exon 1a and exon 2 was 33 kb, while the length between exon 1b and exon 2 was 8.8 kb.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the proapoptotic function of integrin beta(3) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The expression of integrin beta(3) in 67 HCC specimens paired with corresponding neighboring nontumorous tissue was studied by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. The proapoptotic function of integrin beta(3) in SMMC-7721 human hepatoma cells overexpressing ITGB3 (gene coding integrin beta(3)) was determined through colony formation, serum starvation, and anoikis assay.Compared with neighboring pathologically normal liver tissue, approximately 60% of the HCC specimens showed a significant down-regulated level of integrin beta(3) expression. Transient expression of integrin beta(3) in SMMC-7721 resulted in an enhanced level of apoptosis and suppression of colony formation. Cell growth inhibition on serum/ligand deprivation and incidences of anoikis were remarkably increased in SMMC-7721 with stable expression of integrin beta(3) in comparison with vector control transfectants. In addition, expression of fibrinogen and vitronectin, two native ligands for integrin alpha(v)beta(3) in liver, was inhibited, which was correlated with the decreased integrin beta(3) expression. Replenishing these ligands to the starved SMMC-7721 stable transfectants effectively restored the proapoptotic function of integrin beta(3).Down-regulation of integrin beta(3) and its ligands in liver is related to the aggressive growth of HCC. Thus, reconstitution of integrin beta(3) in HCC may be a potential therapeutic approach to inhibit aggressive growth of liver cancer.",

        "abstract": "The microstructure and thermal and mechanical properties of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) fibers after thermal treatment under both taut and free conditions at different temperatures were studied by differential scanning calorimetry, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, microscopy with polarized light, an acoustic method and tensile testing. In particular, the effects of thermal treatment conditions on crystallinity, molecular orientation, and mechanical properties, as well as their interrelationships, were investigated. Both the crystal orientation and crystallinity of the PLA fibers were higher after thermal treatment under taut conditions, even though the molecular orientation was not higher. Thermal treatment relaxed orientated segments, which resulted in increasing crystallinity; however, it did not indicate that the overall molecular alignment of the chains (molecular orientation) would necessarily be high. Tensile strength and elongation were increased with increasing treatment temperature up to 150°C, which corresponded to crystallinity and chain relaxation. The crystallinity detected by XRD, enthalpy measured by DSC, birefringence, and molecular orientation were compared to distinguish the effects of crystallinity, orientation of polymer chains, and crystals.

To determine the significance of HCR2 in HCC, here we compare the expression levels of HCR2 in carcinoma and in paired non-carcinoma tissues using semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical staining. The expression ratio (ER) of HCR2 between the tumor and paired tumor-free tissues was calculated for each case and the data was clinicopathologically analyzed. The expression of HCR2 mRNA was found to be significantly decreased in HCC tissues compared with paired normal tissues (P < 0.001). HCR2 was downregulated in 58% (n = 22) of 38 HCC patients. The ER of HCR2 was higher in Edmondson's grade I/II carcinomas than that in Edmondson's grade III/IV carcinomas (P < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed HCR2 to be notably depressed in carcinoma tissues in 3 out of 4 HCC patients. Immunohistochemical staining indicated most HCR2 protein accumulated in non-carcinoma cells. These results suggested that altered HCR2 expression might play roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of HCC, and it could be a clinical marker for prognosis, and a molecular target for screening potential anti-HCC drugs.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) is a cytokine that plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation in breast cancer. The -509C/T polymorphism in the TGF-β1 gene has been implicated in breast cancer risk. However, studies on the association between this polymorphism and breast cancer risk have produced conflicting results. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis of the -509C/T polymorphism (5,825 cases and 7,953 controls) from seven published case-control studies was performed. Our analysis suggests that -509C/T has no association with breast cancer risk when using either dominant [odds ratio (OR) = 1.01, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.82-1.24], or recessive models (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.66-1.27), or other genetic models to analyze the data. In ethnic subgroups analysis, -509C/T also did not appear to be a risk factor for breast cancer. However, larger scale primary studies are still required to further evaluate the interaction of TGF-β1 -509C/T polymorphism and breast cancer risk in specific populations.",

This work focuses on the relationship between morphologies and mechanical properties of such systems. To aid understanding of blend morphology, a new technique used to identify the two phases through dying of the HPS by iodine has been developed, which provided a simple and convenient way to clearly distinguish between HPMC and HPS phases. It was found that the blend system is immiscible and there is phase transition point depending on blending ratio and solution concentration. The lower transparency point of the blend and phase transition reign of HPMC from continuous phase to separated phase correspond with the variation of tensile modulus. The modulus and elongation decreased with increased solution concentration, which is correlatable with the morphologies present, where it was found that the HPMC gradually changed from a continuous phase to a distinct phase.

The model proposed introduces the concept of interval kernel to interval type-2 fuzzy membership, and provides an architecure to extract reduced-set vectors for generating interval type-2 fuzzy rules. Thus, the overall RV-based IT2FNN can be represented as series expansion of interval kernel, and it does not have to determine the number of rules in advance. By using a hybrid learning mechanism, the proposed RV-based IT2FNN can construct an input-ouput mapping from the training data in the form of fuzzy rules. At last, simulation results show that the RV-based IT2FNN obtained possesses nice generalization and transparency.",

        "abstract": "Studies of brain-specific kinase 2 (BRSK2), an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related kinase, and its homologs suggest that they are multifunctional regulators of cell-cycle progression. BRSK2, which contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, is polyubiquitinated in cells. However, the regulatory mechanisms and exact biological function of BRSK2 remain unclear. Herein, we show that BRSK2 co-localizes with the centrosomes during mitosis. We also demonstrate that BRSK2 protein levels fluctuate during the cell cycle, peaking during mitosis and declining in G1 phase. Furthermore, Cdh1, rather than Cdc20, promotes the degradation of BRSK2 in vivo. Consistent with this finding, knock-down of endogenous Cdh1 blocks BRSK2 degradation during the G1 phase. The conserved KEN box of BRSK2 is required for anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-Cdh1 (APC/CCdh1)-dependent degradation. Additionally, overexpression of either BRSK2(WT) or BRSK2(ΔKEN) increases the percentage of cells in G2/M. Thus, our results provide the first evidence that BRSK2 regulates cell-cycle progression controlled by APC/CCdh1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. © 2012 Li et al.",

The malfunction of the vesicular traffic system might be a cause of the abnormal biological behavior of cancerous liver cells. The Ras superfamily is known to regulate various steps of vesicular traffic in eukaryotic cells. It would be significant to determine the change of vesicular transport molecules such as the members of Ras superfamily in carcinogenesis of liver cells. In the present study, we have cloned nine novel genes encoding human small GTPases: RAB1B, RAB4B, RAB10, RAB22A, RAB24, RAB25 ARL5, SARA1, and SARA2, among which the former six belong to the RAB family and the latter three belong to the ARF/SAR1 family. The identification of these new genes has greatly enlarged the pool of the Ras superfamily. It is interesting to find that they are upregulated in most of the 11 hepatocellular carcinoma and 1 cholangiohepatoma cases. Furthermore, the expression in 16 normal human adult tissues, the chromosome loci, and the gene structures of the nine genes are also described. The above findings could be valuable for understanding the vesicular transport system and elucidating the molecular basis of liver cancer carcinogenesis.",

The retrogradation of corn starch after initial thermal treatment at different temperatures was studied by DSC; in particular, the effect of thermal treatment before and after each endotherm of gelatinization on retrogradation was determined as a function of annealing time. The effect of thermal treatment at a certain temperature on the residual gelatinization endotherm at a higher temperature is also discussed. It was found that the higher temperature of thermal treatment always removed all the endotherms below that temperature. However, a certain thermal treatment temperature could affect the residual endotherm above this treatment temperature. The time-dependent retrogradation of corn starch is mainly due to G and M1 endotherms. The temperature and enthalpy of the melting of amylose–lipid complexes M2 and nonlipid complex amylose Z were not affected by aging time. The final enthalpy of retrogradation was found to be lower than that of gelatinization.",

This paper summarizes our work on dynamic railway tunnel 3D clearance inspection based on a multi-camera and structured-light vision system (MSVS). First, the configuration of the MSVS is described. Then, the global calibration for the MSVS is discussed in detail. The onboard vision system is mounted on a dedicated vehicle and is expected to suffer from multiple degrees of freedom vibrations brought about by the running vehicle. Any small vibration can result in substantial measurement errors. In order to overcome this problem, a vehicle motion deviation rectifying method is investigated. Experiments using the vision inspection system are conducted with satisfactory online measurement results.",

        "abstract": "We report here the cloning and tissue distribution of the human B3GALT7 gene, a member of the β1,3-Glycosyltransferase family, structurally related to the β1,3-Galactosyltransferase family and\n β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase family, isolated from a human lung cDNA library. B3GALT7 is mapped to chromosome 19q13.2 by browsing the UCSC genomic database. It contains an ORF with length of 1191bp, encoding\n a protein with a signal peptide sequence and galactosyl-T domain, and its molecular weight and isoelectric point is predicted\n to be 43.3 kDa and 8.67 respectively. The molecular weight of the protein when expressed in E. coli corresponded to that expected. Northern blotting showed that B3GALT7 was highly expressed in lung, throat and ileum, whereas the expression level was low in tongue, breast, uteri, testis. In\n addition, it was also demonstrated that B3GALT7 is differentially transcribed in human tumor cell lines. Published in 2003.",

Floating oil storage system was proposed as a new facility for stockpiling of emergency petroleum reserve. Mooring is one of the key technologies to ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of oil storage system by keeping position safely. The concept, analysis, design and reliability of this mooring system were described. Safety assessment of mooring system by using failure probability is one of the most important means for evaluating the reliability of floating oil storage system. A numerical simulation method for calculating failure probability of mooring system considering failure of breakwater was proposed. The moment equation of oil storage vessels was solved by time domain mooring simulation, and the reliability analysis of mooring system was carried out. As a result, it is shown that the mooring system has a reliability of 0.999997 per year, and the present simulation method is effective to evaluate quantitatively the safety of mooring system of the floating oil storage vessels.",

The as-prepared MUA functionalized AuNCs (MUA-AuNCs) have good water solubility, excellent photostability, and strong fluorescence emission at 610 nm with a quantum yield of 7.28% in water. The fluorescence of MUA-AuNCs was first quenched by copper ions through electron transfer, subsequently caused obvious restoration by competitive effect after adding penicillamine, making it a potential fluorescent sensor for penicillamine with a detection limit of 0.08 μM. Furthermore, the newly designed fluorescence \"on-off-on\" assay was explored for the measurement of penicillamine in complex real water and urine samples with satisfactory results.",

Results showed that TP was well dispersed in the starch matrix, which induced a slight influence on the surface and barrier properties of the films. TP addition led to an important improvement in antioxidant capability, as well as inhibition efficiency against the microorganisms of S. aureus and E. coli. However, a decrease in mechanical properties of films was observed.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The well recognized complex issue of compatibility between starch and gelatin was studied based on their interfacial and phase composition using Raman microscopy. Blending films with different ratios of gelatin and starch was used in this work. Raman beam focused on a 1.7 μm × 1.5 μm detection region and the micro-spectroscope scanned across the gelatin–starch interface. The ratio of areas of saccharide bonds (1173-953 cm −1 ) and amide I bands (1750-1550 cm −1 ) was used to monitor the relative distributions of the two components of the blends. The Raman spectral maps confirmed that for all the blends investigated, gelatin formed a continuous matrix in which starch inclusions were dispersed. Intermediate phases consisted of amylose interacted with gelatin, which demonstrated this was an unique and effective method to investigate starch based blend and composite materials.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. To date, many publications have evaluated the association between Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) Val432Leu polymorphism and breast cancer risk. However, the results remain inconclusive. In order to derive a more precise estimation of the association, a meta-analysis was performed in this study. By searching Medline, Pubmed, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, 26 studies including 19,028 cases and 21,275 controls were collected for CYP1B1 Val432Leu polymorphism. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between CYP1B1 Val432Leu polymorphism and breast cancer risk. The pooled ORs were performed for codominant model, dominant model, and recessive model, respectively. Overall, no significant associations between CYP1B1 Val432Leu polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility were found for Val/Val versus Leu/Leu (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.90-1.06), Val/Leu versus Leu/Leu (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.93-1.09), Val/Val + Val/Leu versus Leu/Leu (OR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93-1.08) and Val/Val versus Val/Leu + Leu/Leu (OR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.91-1.01). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, menopausal status and sources of controls, significant associations were still not observed in all genetic models. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides strong evidence that CYP1B1 Val432Leu polymorphism is not associated with breast cancer risk.",

The effects of annealing on the gelatinization and microstructures of the starches were studied using DSC, XRD and a microscope equipped with both normal and polarized light. In addition, a high-pressure DSC pan was used to study the effects of high-temperature annealing on the multiphase transitions of starches with different water contents. The granular size of the starches increased after the annealing process, but the size variation rates were different, with higher amylopectin contents resulting in a higher diameter growth rates and final accretion ratios. DSC results showed that annealing increased the gelatinization enthalpy of the amylose-rich starches. The increased enthalpy was mainly attributed to endotherm G – there were no significant changes to endotherms M1, M2 or Z – indicating that annealing mainly affected the helical length of shorter or sub-optional amylopectins, in particular the amylopectin in amylose-rich starches. The XRD traces of all starches after annealing remained unchanged.",

        "abstract": "Serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-like kinase (SGKL) has been identified as a new integrator that decodes lipid signals produced by the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). SGKL is activated via its lipid-binding domain (phox homology domain) in response to PI3K signaling. However, downstream targets of SGKL as well as the role of SGKL as a mediator in PI3K signaling in human tissues remain to be established. In this study, we identified human glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3beta) as a specific interacting partner with SGKL in a yeast two-hybrid screening of human brain cDNA library. The association between these two proteins is confirmed independently in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the kinase activity of wild-type SGKL was required for the in vitro phosphorylation of a GSK-3 crosstide fusion protein at serine-21/9 as demonstrated with a Phospho-GSK-3alpha/beta (Ser21/9) specific antibody. The present results provide strong evidences that SGKL could utilize GSK-3beta as a direct downstream target by phosphorylating GSK-3beta at serine-9.",

The eukaryotic cytosolic\n chaperonin, CCT-Chaperonin Containing TCP-1 (tailless complex polypeptide-1), is mainly involved in the formation of cytoskeletal\n proteins and is essential for cell viability. Mammalian CCT is commonly a protein complex composed of 7–9 subunit species.\n We have isolated a novel full-length cDNA from human testis cDNA library. This cDNA of 1935 bp contains a 1605 bp open reading\n frame (ORF) encoding 535 amino acids (aa). The deduced protein of the cDNA is highly homologous to the CCTβ subunit ofsaccharomyces cerevisiae,schizosaccharomyces pombe, caenorhabditis elegans and mouse, etc. Especially high homology (97%) is found between the deduced protein and mouse CCTβ. On the basis of such\n high homology, the protein encoded by the new gene was proposed to be a human CCTβ subunit. Northern hybridization showed\n that humanCCTβ gene is expressed as a transcript of about 2.0 kb in various tissues. Overexpression was seen in testis with the expression\n level 3–24 times of those in other tissues. TheCCTβ gene was mapped to human chromosome 12q14 by Radiation Hybrid Mapping.

        "abstract": "The starch granule is a heterogeneous material: specifically, it has both linear (amylose) and branched (amylopectin) structures; and physically, it contains both amorphous and crystalline regions. 1 The gelatinisation of starch has attracted much attention in both food science and processing of the emerging biodegradable starch-based polymers since it acts as an important and unique role in the proper conversion of starch in these applications. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has proven to be an extremely valuable tool to quantify the gelatinisation of starch and has been widely used to study the thermal behaviours of starch. The DSC thermograms give the possibility of analysing transition temperatures as well as transition enthalpies; the enthalpy (ΔH) of a transition was interpreted as corresponding to the amount of crystal order (or double-helical structure) in the starch suspensions that disrupted at a heating scan. Modulated temperature DSC (MTDSC) has become a popular tool in the thermal characterisation of polymers ever since its development in 1993. 2,3 Many researchers have reported the use of MTDSC to study thermal transitions of starch and they claimed that the total heat flow in MTDSC can be separated into heat capacity (reversible thermal events) and kinetic components (irreversible thermal events) and thus the glass transition of starch amorphous regions during gelatinisation is claimed to be observed. 4-8 In the meantime however, there has been reports arguing against the validity of the MTDSC technique itself and its so called 'reversible' and 'non-reversible' heat flow ever since its emergence. 9-11 The gelatinisation of starch is one of its complex thermal transitions; and the DSC measurements of gelatinisation should be treated with much care to avoid incorrect analyses. 12 In this study, the results of waxy starch with 75% moisture content by DSC and MTDSC was compared to discuss the effectiveness of MTDSC in the application of characterising starch",

        "abstract": "Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF)-related proteins (HRPs) comprise a family of six members and are characterised by a conserved HATH domain. Among the family members, HDGF was the first to be identified as a mitogenic factor and shown to play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis. The aim of the present study is to examine the relevance of HDGF-related protein-3 (HRP-3), another member of the HRP family in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).HRP-3 expression in HCC tissues was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. The biological consequences of overexpression and knockdown of HRP-3 in HCC cell lines were studied in vitro and in vivo.Expression of HRP-3 mRNA and protein was shown to be highly upregulated in HCC tissues. While knockdown of HRP-3 by small interference RNAs failed to affect anchorage-dependent growth of HCC cells, it inhibited anchorage-independent growth of HCC cells in vitro and xenograft tumour growth in vivo. Further, knockdown of HRP-3 was shown to sensitise HCC cells to anoikis. Moreover, HRP-3 specifically activated the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway without affecting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Importantly, inhibition of the ERK pathway diminished HRP-3-mediated protection of HCC cells from anoikis. Finally, knockdown of HRP-3 was shown to enhance apoptosis of HCC cells induced by multiple chemotherapeutic drugs.These findings indicate that HRP-3 plays an essential role in HCC pathogenesis and suggest that it may serve as a novel prognostic marker and molecular target for development of drugs for treatment of HCC.",

In addition, we identified death associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK-3/ZIP kinase) as a binding partner for TCP10L by yeast two-hybrid screening, followed with immunoprecipitation and subcellular localization experiments. Mutagenesis study revealed that this interaction was dependant on the leucine zipper motif-containing region.

        "abstract": "Objective: YY1 is a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the regulation of cell growth, development, and differentiation. Although YY1 can regulate human papillomavirusYtype (HPV) viral oncogenes E6 and E7, it remains unknown if YY1 plays a key role in carcinoma progression of HPV-infected cells. Here we sought to determine whether YY1 is upregulated in the cervical cancer tissues and YY1 inhibition contributes to apoptosis of cervical cancer cells, which is at least partly p 53 dependent. Therefore, YY1 can be a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer treatment by arsenic trioxide (As 2O 3). Materials and Methods: The expression level of YY1 was examined and analyzed by Western blot in pathologically confirmed primary cervical cancer samples, in the adjacent normal samples, as well as in normal cervix samples. The effects of YY1 inhibition by specific small interfering RNA in HeLa cells were determined by Western blot analysis of p 53 level, cell growth curve, colony formation assay, and apoptosis. The contribution of YY1 to As 2O 3-induced p 53 activation and apoptosis was also examined by Western blot and cell cycle analysis. Results: Here we report that the expression level of YY1 is significantly elevated in the primary cancer tissues. In HPV-positive HeLa cells, small interfering RNAYmediated YY1 inhibition induced apoptosis and increased the expression of p 53. Treatment of HeLa cells with As 2O 3, a known antiYcervical cancer agent, reduced both protein and mRNA levels of YY1 in HeLa cells. YY1 knockdown significantly further enhanced As 2O 3- induced apoptosis. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that the expression of YY1 is upregulated in cervical carcinomas and that YY1 plays a critical role in the progression of HPV-positive cervical cancer. In addition, YY1 inhibition induces p 53 activation and apoptosis in HPVinfected HeLa cells. Thus, YY1 is an As 2O 3 target and could serve as a potential drug sensitizer for antiYcervical cancer therapy. Copyright © 2011 by IGCS and ESGO.",

Here, we identified four-and-a-half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) as a functional partner of PARP12 through protein affinity purification. Although PARP12 did not mono-ADP-ribosylate FHL2 in vitro and in vivo, PARP12 deficiency decreased the protein level of FHL2 by promoting its ubiquitination and increased the expression level of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1), which is independent of PARP12 enzymatic activity. We also provided evidence that PARP12 deficiency increased the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and promoted HCC metastasis in vivo by regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. These results indicated that PARP12 is a tumor suppressor that plays an important role in HCC metastasis through the regulation of FHL2 stability and TGF-β1 expression.",

Conventional FCM algorithm is sensitive to noise especially in the presence of intensity inhomogeneity in MRI. Main reason is that a single fuzzifier in FCM cannot properly represent pattern memberships for all clusters. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for fuzzy segmentation of MRI data. The algorithm utilizes two fuzzifiers used in interval type-2 FCM and a spatial constraint on the membership functions. Also, in our investigation, validity functions are extended to generalized form for interval type-2 fuzzy clustering. The experimental results on both synthetic and MR images show that the proposed algorithm has better performance on image segmentation than conventional FCM based algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. It is important for HCC cells to resist to apoptosis caused by adverse energy pressure in microenvironment during the HCC tumorigenesis. HRP-3, a member of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF)-related proteins (HRP) family, was shown to be highly up-regulated in HCC tissues and play an important role in HCC pathogenesis based on our previous research. The aim of the study was to investigate the HRP-3's role in HCC cells endurance against energy pressure.The HRP-3 expression level in primary rat hepatocytes and human HCC cell lines were examined when changing the extracellular glucose concentration. To assess biological function of HRP-3 during glucose deprivation, HRP-3 stable knockdown and control clones of SMMC-7721 and SK-hep1 were constructed for further analysis including cellular morphology observation, apoptotic sub G1 peak analysis and the mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 detection in the absence of glucose.Expression level of HRP-3 protein was highly up-regulated both in primary rat hepatocytes and HCC cells as prolonging the stimulation of glucose deprivation. Both morphology and sub-G1 phase analyses indicated that stable knockdown of HRP-3 sensitized HCC cells to glucose deprivation-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, silence of HRP-3 prevented the de-phosphorylation of S6K1 induced by glucose deprivation, which was an essential molecular event for HCC cell survival in energy pressure.We propose that glucose deprivation-induced HRP-3 up-regulation potentially plays a major role in protecting HCC cells against apoptosis caused by energy pressure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is introduced for the investigation of the liquid sloshing in an annular cylindrical container with the coaxial porous structures. The main advantages of the SBFEM for this problem is that only the outer wall of the annular tank is discretized while the inner wall and the porous structures need not be treated, which is not only convenient for the generation of mesh, but also reduces the spatial dimension by one. Meanwhile, the solutions of the velocity potential are analytical in the radical direction of the scaled boundary coordinate system. In this paper, two types of the porous structures, that are, the circular and the arc-shaped porous structures, are taken into account. For the arc-shaped system, a virtual circular by extending the arc-shaped structure porous is introduced and one can set the porous-effect parameter of the virtual section to infinity, so that the whole flow domain can be divided into two sub-domains by the porous structure as the same approach with the circular system. By the assumption of the incompressible, inviscid, and irrotational flow and using the variational principle, the SBFEM governing equations with respect to the radical coordinate of the velocity potential in each sub-domain are obtained. Then, the governing equations can be solved analytically by introducing the Bessel functions and the modified Bessel functions as the base solutions. The excellent efficiency and accuracy of the proposed formulations are demonstrated by comparing the SBFEM numerical results with the analytical solutions. In addition, the effects of the different parameters for sloshing characteristics, such as the porous-effect parameter, radius of porous structure, standing wave number, opening degree and location of the arc-shaped porous structure are further studied.",

        "abstract": "Aurora-A is a centrosome-localized serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in multiple human cancers. Here, we report an intramolecular inhibitory regulation in Aurora-A between its N-terminal regulatory domain (aa 1-128, Nt) and the C-terminal catalytic domain (aa 129-403, Cd). Removal of Nt results in a significant increase in kinase activity. Nt inhibited the activity of the single C-terminal kinase domain, but had little effect on the activity of the full-length of Aurora-A. PP1 is not involved in this regulation, instead, Nt interacts Cd directly in vitro and in vivo. The non-Aurora box (aa 64-128) in the N-terminal negatively regulated the kinase activity of the C-terminal kinase domain by intramolecular interaction with aa 240-300 within the C-terminal.",

        "abstract": "Three novel cDNAs encoding putative protein phosphatase-1 inhibitory protein (PPP1R14A) were isolated from human, mouse and rat. The human, mouse and rat PPP1R14A proteins were all of 147 amino acids sharing about 90% sequence identity to porcine CPI17, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 holoenzyme. The protein sequence 33RHARVTVK40, which is important for the inhibitory potency of porcine CPI17, was conserved in mammalian PPP1R14A. Northern blot analysis showed that human PPP1R14A was highly expressed as a 600 bp transcript in heart, prostate, testis, ovary, colon, small intestine and pancreas, lowly in brain, placenta, skeletal muscle and spleen and lung. The distribution of mouse and rat PPP1R14A was more specific and different from that of human PPP1R14A, abundant in lung, moderate/abundant in testis, moderate in brain and low in heart. In addition, we mapped human PPP1R14A to chromosome 19q13.13-q13.2 by radiation hybrid mapping, and determined that the human PPP1R14A gene spanned a 5.1-kb region and consisted of four exons and three introns.",

        "abstract": "HIV-1 integrase (IN) plays an important role in integrating viral DNA into human genome, which has been considered as the drug target for anti-AIDS therapy. The appearance of drug-resistance mutants urgently requires novel inhibitors that act on non-active site of HIV-1 IN. Nanoparticles have such unique geometrical and chemical properties, which inspires us that nanoparticles like nanotubes may serve as better HIV-1 IN inhibitors than the conventional inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study the binding of a carbon nanotube (CNT) to a full-length HIV-1 IN. The results showed that the CNT could stably bind to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of HIV-1 IN. The CNT also induced a domain-shift which disrupted the binding channel for viral DNA. Further MD simulation showed that a HIV-1 IN inhibitor, 5ClTEP was successfully sealed inside the uncapped CNT. These results indicate that the CNT may serve as a potential dual-functional HIV-1 IN inhibitor, not only inducing conformation change as an allosteric inhibitor but also carrying small-molecular inhibitors as a drug delivery system.",

D-penicillamine is a zwitterionic compound and has different forms depending on specific pH ranges. The thiol group of D-penicillamine has high affinity towards the surface of gold nanoparticles and can replace other surface ligands. When pH values were close to its isoelectrical point (pH(I)), the D-penicillamine capped gold nanoparticles aggregated through hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions, resulting in the releasing of carbon dots from gold nanoparticles. The dual-mode probe consisted of fluorescent carbon dots and gold nanoparticles, and the fluorescence of carbon dots was quenched by the attached gold nanoparticles due to the FRET. Then, the fluorescence can be recovered in presence of D-penicillamine due to the gold nanoparticles aggregation in specific pH range. Under the optimum conditions, the probe has linear response for D-penicillamine in the 0.25-1.5 μM concentration range with a detection limit of 0.085 μM. This method provides a potential application in sensitive detection of D-penicillamine.",

Here we described the characterization of SEPT12, sharing closest homology to SEPT3 and SEPT9. It was revealed that subcellular localization of SEPT12 varied at interphase and mitotic phase. While SEPT12 formed filamentous structures at interphase, it was localized to the central spindle and to midbody during anaphase and cytokinesis, respectively. In addition, we found that SEPT12 can interact with SEPT6 in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction was independent of the coiled coil domain of SEPT6. Further, co-expression of SEPT12 altered the filamentous structure of SEPT6 in Hela cells. Therefore, our result showed that the interaction between different septins may affect the septin filament structure.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common worldwide malignancy with high morbidity and mortality. Hepatitis B viral (HBV)-encoded X protein (HBx) and natural HBx variants play important roles in HBV-associated HCC development. HBx is an unstable protein that can be degraded in vivo. Our previous study found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah-1 could target HBx for poly-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation and attenuate the transcriptional activity of HBx. However, in HCC patients, high expression levels of HBx and HBx variants are frequently observed and are associated with HCC progression. The mechanism underlying their up-regulation is largely unknown. In this study, we screened for Siah-1 mutations in 270 HCC samples and 9 HCC cell lines, and examined Siah-1 mRNA and protein expression in a subset of paired HCC specimens. Our results demonstrate that Siah-1 is highly conserved, as no somatic mutation was identified, with the exception of one synonymous transition from G to A at codon 67. Both the mRNA and protein levels of Siah-1 were significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues compared with their adjacent normal counterparts. We constructed three natural HBx truncates that were identified in our HCC cases. We found that Siah-1 failed to decrease the stability of these HBx variants and was unable to inhibit the transcriptional activity of these HBx truncates at heat shock elements (HSEs). Moreover, Siah-1 had weaker association with three HBx mutants than full length HBx. Therefore, our findings suggest that down-regulation of Siah-1, but not its mutations, and natural HBx variants resistant to Siah-1-induced degradation may be a novel mechanism for HCC development.

Methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) was used as a compatibilizer and was distributed in different phases through controlled processing. The addition of MDI showed a stronger effect on thermal and rheological properties when it was mainly distributed in the polyester phase prior to blending. Starch was shown to increase the shear viscosity of both types of polyesters. The two blends, starch/PCL and starch/PBSA, showed a similar pattern of a power law dependence of viscosity on shear rate. MDI was shown to enhance the effect of starch on the melting and decomposition temperatures, especially when distributed in the polyester phase. © Hanser Publishers, Munich.",

After thermal processing, these materials are predominantly amorphous, however under controlled humidity over time the evolution of B-type (found in high amylose starches) and Vh type (generally induced via processing) crystallinity was observed. These structural changes have been analysed and correlated to final mechanical properties (modulus, tensile strength and break elongation). A “nanostabilization” effect was also observed over time in starch samples containing montmorillonite. It is proposed that in these systems the montmorillonite disrupts the retrogradation process reducing the rate of embrittlement over time. This is of significant importance for improving the shelf life of thermoplastic starches for industrial applications.",

In the past several decades, various genetic variations such as mutations and polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with HCC risk, progression, survival, and recurrence. However, to our knowledge, these genetic variations have not been comprehensively and systematically compiled. In this study we constructed dbHCCvar, a free online database of human genetic variations in HCC. Eligible publications were collected from PubMed, and detailed information and major research data from each eligible study were then extracted and recorded in our database. As a result, dbHCCvar contains almost all human genetic variations reported to be associated or not associated with HCC risk, clinical pathology, drug reaction, survival, or recurrence to date. It is expected that dbHCCvar will function as a useful tool for researchers to facilitate the search and identification of new genetic markers for HCC. dbHCCvar is free for all visitors at http://GenetMed.fudan.edu.cn/dbHCCvar.",

        "abstract": "Natural biopolymer materials have enormous potential in important, rapidly growing applications ranging from green electronics, dye and heavy metal removal, oil/water separation, therapeutic agent delivery, tissue engineering scaffolds, biological devices, optics, and sensing. However, the application of advanced functional biopolymer materials suffers from their poor processability and weak mechanical properties. Regarding this, there are enormous challenges to break the strong intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding) in their native forms, while re-establishing predominant hydrogen bonding in the processed materials in a cost-effective way. Here, we report our breakthrough to prepare biopolymer alloy materials based on chitosan and silk peptide (SP) with outstanding mechanical properties via a facile, dry, melt processing method. The 1:1 (wt./wt.) chitosan-SP film had a toughness of 19.9 J cm, Youngu0027s modulus of 1855 MPa, and tensile strength of 95.9 MPa, which are similar to, or even better than, most engineering polymers. We propose that our method could maximize the molecular interactions between chitosan and SP via a simple and effective thermomechanical mixing, which resulted in considerably enhanced mechanical properties. Moreover, dehydration/rehydration can reversibly adjust the mechanical properties of the new biopolymer alloys, which demonstrates the dominant effect of hydrogen bonding in enabling the mechanical properties of these interesting alloys. Our simple approach to engineering high-performance biopolymer materials without resorting to complex chemistries and 3D-structural construction can be envisioned to bring about a new direction in the design of advanced functional materials where cost effectiveness is the priority.",

        "abstract": "Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a member of peptidyl prolyl isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds on the NH-terminal side of Pro residues in peptide chains. Altered expression of CypA has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the biological functions of CypA in HCC remain unknown. We found that the level of CypA expression correlated with the metastatic capability of two HCC cell lines, MHCC97-L and MHCC97-H. Stable expression of ectopic CypA in SK-Hep1 cells promotes cell adhesion, motility, chemotaxis, and in vivo lung metastasis, without affecting cell proliferation. We further analyzed microarray results to identify target genes controlled by CypA. Twenty-one genes related to metastasis were altered by CypA over-expression. A member of matrix metalloproteinase, MMP3, was identified by microarray analysis. The regulation of MMP3 and its homologue MMP9 by CypA were further confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and zymography assay. Taken together, our data suggest that CypA promotes HCC cell metastasis at least partially through up-regulation of MMP3 and MMP9.",

        "abstract": "Regulated interactions between kinetochores and spindle microtubules are critical for maintaining genomic stability during chromosome segregation. Defects in chromosome segregation are widespread phenomenon in human cancers that are thought to serve as the fuel for tumorigenic progression. Tumor suppressor proteins ASPP1 and ASPP2, two members of the apoptosis stimulating proteins of p53 (ASPP) family, are frequently down-regulated in human cancers. Here we report that ASPP1/2 are required for proper mitotic progression. In ASPP1/2 co-depleted cells, the persistence of unaligned chromosomes and the reduction of tension across sister kinetochores on aligned chromosomes resulted in persistent spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation. Using protein affinity purification methods, we searched for functional partners of ASPP1/2, and found that ASPP1/2 were associated with a subset of kinetochore proteins (Hec1, KNL-1, and CENP-F). It was found that ASPP1/2 act as PP1-targeting subunits to facilitate the interaction between PP1 and Hec1, and catalyze Hec1 (Ser165) dephosphorylation during late mitosis. These observations revealed a previously unrecognized function of ASPP1/2 in chromosome segregation and kinetochore-microtubule attachments that likely contributes to their roles in chromosome stability and tumor suppression.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To improve performance of enhanced recovery processes in heterogeneous oil sands, use of an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion could be an innovative conformance control technology due to its strong plugging ability. In this study, emulsions were firstly characterized by their distributions of droplet size and interfacial tension (IFT). Parallel-sandpack flow tests were used to investigate the performance of conformance control by O/W emulsion injection. In the first set of parallel-sandpack tests with three different IFT emulsions, it was found that a moderate IFT (0.23 mN/m) emulsion performed well for obtaining a fractional flow ratio of 0.5:0.5. With this moderate IFT, three additional sets of tests were conducted to investigate the impacts of emulsion quality (i.e., oil content), droplet size, and oil viscosity on performance of conformance control. To investigate the conformance control performance in more severely heterogeneous models, more tests were carried out in parallel-sandpack models with permeability ratios of 4:1 and 5:1. Experimental results indicate that a carefully designed O/W emulsion can not only be strong enough to provide sufficient capillary resistance in the high permeability sandpack, but can also be flexible to deform and pass through the pore throats in the low permeability sandpack. Therefore, the droplets can deform and migrate deeply into both the high permeability sandpack and the low permeability sandpack, leading to an ideal fractional flow ratio (0.5:0.5) and achieving a good conformance control in the parallel-sandpack model. A procedure of developing an optimal emulsion system for conformance control has been also proposed for a specific emulsion injection conditions with desired injection rate and emulsion volume.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a robust interval type-2 possibilistic C-means (IT2PCM) clustering algorithm which is actually alternating cluster estimation, but membership functions are selected with interval type-2 fuzzy sets by the users. The cluster prototypes are calculated by type reduction combined with defuzzification; consequently they could be directly extracted to generate interval type-2 fuzzy rules that can be used to obtain a first approximation to the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS). The proposed clustering algorithm is robust to uncertain inliers and outliers, at the same time provides a good initial structure of IT2FLS for further tuning in a subsequent process. Excellent simulation results are obtained for the problem of classification and forecasting.",

Recently, correlations of CypA with tumor pathogenesis have been studied.

The exogeneous CypA protein can substantially stimulate H446 cell growth in dependence on its PPIase activity. We also showed that CypA protein can stimulate ERK1/2 signal in dose and time dependent manners and almost has no effect to p38 and JNK signals. Elucidation of the precise role of CypA in these pathways may lead to new targeted therapies for small cell lung cancer.",

It is well known that LPAAT is involved in lipid biosynthesis, while its role in tumour progression has been of emerging interest in the last few years. To date, seven members of the LPAAT gene family have been found in human. Here we report a novel LPAAT member, designated as LPAAT-theta, which was 2728 base pairs in length and contained an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 434 amino acids. The LPAAT-theta gene consisted of 12 exons and 11 introns, and mapped to chromosome 4q21.23. LPAAT-theta was ubiquitously expressed in 18 human tissues by RT-PCR analysis. Subcellular localization of LPAAT-theta-EGFP fusion protein revealed that LPAAT-theta was distributed primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of COS-7 cells. Furthermore, we found that the overexpression of LPAAT-theta can induce mTOR-dependent p70S6K phosphorylation on Thr389 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation on Ser65 in HEK293T cells.",

HBx can be ubiquitinated and degraded through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating HBx ubiquitin-dependent degradation is still unknown. In this study, we identified Siah-1 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for HBx, which interacted with HBx and facilitated HBx poly-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Co-expression of Siah-1 attenuated the transcriptional transactivation of HBx on glucocorticoid response element (GRE), heat shock response element (HSE) and cAMP response element (CRE) signal pathways. Moreover, Siah-1 participated in p53-mediated HBx degradation. Therefore, Siah-1 may play important roles in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HBx and may be involved in suppressing the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study presents a semi-analytical solution with the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) for the sloshing of liquid in vertical cylinders with the coaxial dual circular or arc-shaped porous structures in the context of the linear potential theory. Firstly, the whole flow domain can be divided into three sub-domains with the porous structures and the wall of tank, in which the arc-shaped porous structure should be extended to the whole circle and the perforated coefficient of the extension section is set to infinite. Then the velocity potential of flow in each sub-domain is determined by utilizing the SBFEM for solving the Helmholtz equation or the modified Helmholtz equations, and the fundamental equations and the solution process of the SBFEM for this sloshing problem have been derived in detail. In the SBFEM, one of the superior features is that only the circumferential boundary of the computational domain needs to be discretized with the same form of the finite element. As a result, the spatial dimension of the problem can be reduced by one. As a key point, although there are the dual circular or arc-shaped porous structures, only the wall of tank should be discretized. Meanwhile, the governing equations can be solved analytically in the radial direction by using the Bessel functions or the modified Bessel functions. Numerical examples show that only a small quantity of the discretized elements over the cylindrical boundary can achieve an excellent agreement between the numerical results obtained by the proposed method and the analytical solutions, which demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this formulation. Finally, several numerical examples are further studied to investigate the effects of the radius of the porous structures, the porous-effect parameter, the nondimensional wave number, and the opening degree together with the distribution of the centre of the arc-shaped porous structures on the sloshing characteristics of liquid in the cylindrical container with the porous structures.",

In the proposed method, the cluster prototype update equation is calculated by type reduction combined with defuzzification. It is robust to uncertain inliers and outliers on the basis of its φ function analysis in the framework of robust statistics. Simulation results of comparing IT2PCM with existing methods show the nice robust properties of IT2PCM.",

It is composed of seven exons and is localized on chromosome 2p14. Western blot showed that the molecular weight of PNO1 is about 35kDa. RT-PCR results in 16 human tissues indicated that PNO1 is expressed mainly in liver, lung, spleen and kidney, slightly in thymus, testis, ovary, respectively, but not in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, placenta, pancreas, prostate, small intestine, colon and peripheral blood leukocytes. GFP fusion expression in mammalian cells exhibited its localization in the nucleus, especially in nucleoli. Subcellular localization of thirteen GFP fusion PNO1 deletion proteins showed that the region of 92-230 aa is solely responsible for its nucleolar retention, and KH domain alone is not sufficient for nucleolar retention. The PNO1 family shows significant conservation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.",

Although RLIM was reported to play important roles in some biological processes such as imprinted X-chromosome inactivation and regulation of TGF-β pathway etc., other functions of RLIM are largely unknown. Here, we identified RLIM as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for c-Myc, one of the most frequently deregulated oncoproteins in human cancers. RLIM associates with c-Myc in vivo and in vitro independently of the E3 ligase activity of RLIM. Moreover, RLIM promotes the polyubiquitination of c-Myc protein independently of Ser62 and Thr58 phosphorylation of c-Myc. However, RLIM-mediated ubiquitination does not affect c-Myc stability. Instead, RLIM inhibits the transcriptional activity of c-Myc through which RLIM restrains cell proliferation. Our results suggest that RLIM may function as a tumor suppressor by controlling the activity of c-Myc oncoprotein.",

An oven and a sieving machine were used instead of hot CFB facility to test the ash formation character of coal in CFB boiler. A cold CFB test rig was also built, whose results were used to compare with that from the suggested method. The theoretical basis of the simple method was also discussed. The result shows that the sieving method is quite similar to the fluidizing method in the investigation of the ash size distribution and its attrition.

        "abstract": "To analyze the present situation and influencing factors of discrimination against hepatitis B patients and carriers among rural adults in three eastern provinces in China.By using the method of probability proportionate to size (PPS), we involved a sample of 9 269 rural adults aged above 18 years old from 22 villages of 7 counties in Beijing, Hebei, Shandong in 2011 and 2012. We used a self-designed interview questionnaire with questions about the individual and household characteristics, attitudes toward hepatitis B patients and carriers, individual HBV vaccination history, etc. We analyzed the hepatitis B discrimination score and its distribution, and we also created a multinomial logistic regression model to analyze the influencing factors of discrimination.Of all the participants, 51.15% (4 741) were afraid of being infected with HBV when getting on with hepatitis B patients or carriers; 51.29% (4 754), 61.14% (5 667) and 52.22% (4 841) of them were not willing to accept gifts from hepatitis B patients or carriers, have dinner with them, or hug and shake hands with them, respectively; 73.92% (6 852) were unwilling to their children's playing with kids whose parents were hepatitis B patients or carriers, and 86.68% (8 034) were unwilling to their children's marrying hepatitis B patients or carriers. Of all the participants, only 0.88% (82) were totally discrimination-free (discrimination score = 0); mild or without discrimination (< 0 discrimination score ≤ 5) accounted for 23.70% (2 197/9 269); severe discrimination (discrimination score ≥ 6) accounted for 76.30% (7 072). The multiple multinomial logistic regression showed that migratory workers, other occupations like technician, civil servants and village doctors were less likely to show severe HBV-related discrimination compared with farmers, with OR (95% CI) 0.86 (0.75-0.98), 0.77 (0.67-0.87), 0.57 (0.41-0.79), respectively. Compared with the lowest income group (< 10 000 RMB/year per person), and the highest income group (> 40 000 RMB/year per person) had an OR (95% CI) of 0.57 (0.46-0.70). People with higher education tended to show less severe discrimination. The high education group had an OR (95% CI) of 0.64 (0.51-0.80) based on the low education group. And compared with people whose self-assessment of health status was very good, those who assessed their health status as very poor showed less severe discrimination, with an OR (95% CI) of 0.41 (0.25-0.67).The situation of discrimination against hepatitis B patients and carriers among rural adults in three eastern provinces was serious. It is of great urgency to eliminate the discrimination. Work on eliminating hepatitis B discrimination should focus on farmers, people with low incomes, and people with low educational level.",

        "abstract": "There are increasing evidences that HSD17B1 plays a significant role in the development of breast cancer. However, published data on the association between HSD17B1 Ser312Gly polymorphism and breast cancer risk are inconclusive. In order to derive a more precise estimation of this relationship, a meta-analysis including 9 studies with 31,053 subjects was performed in this study. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between HSD17B1 Ser312Gly polymorphism and breast cancer risk. The pooled ORs were performed for codominant model (Gly/Gly versus Ser/Ser, Gly/Ser versus Ser/Ser), dominant model (Gly/Gly + Gly/Ser versus Ser/Ser), and recessive model (Gly/Gly versus Gly/Ser + Ser/Ser), respectively. Overall, no significant associations were detected between HSD17B1 Ser312Gly polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility. However, in the stratified analysis by ethnicity, significant associations were observed in Caucasians for Gly/Gly versus Ser/Ser (OR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.83-1.00), Gly/Ser versus Ser/Ser (OR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99), and Gly/Gly + Gly/Ser versus Ser/Ser (OR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.86-0.98). In conclusion, this study suggests that HSD17B1 312Gly allele may be a protective factor for breast cancer development in Caucasians. However, large sample and representative population-based studies with homogeneous breast cancer patients and well-matched controls are warranted to confirm this finding.",

So far, the experience and performance evaluation of the boilers with such large capacity are very limited. A series of cold and hot tests were carried out on the boiler in order to optimize the operation and provide more information to the future design. The influence of coal properties, bed material fluidization, air distribution, bed temperature and pressure drop on the boiler performance such as carbon content in fly ash was assessed and discussed. Some problems of the boiler, including the bottom ash system, milling system, abrasion of the heating surface in the furnace, refractory stability, and exhaust fuel gas temperature are reported and suggestions are given for the future improvement and design.",

PR was used, for the first time, as an antimicrobial compound and was incorporated directly in PCL matrix, without the extraction of any active compound from the fruit rind. The PCL-based antimicrobial films were fabricated using extrusion technique. It was observed that PCL/PR films demonstrated reasonably good antimicrobial activity at higher concentration of active compound. Addition of starch not only lowered the cost but also improved the rigidity of PCL matrix. Adding to this, starch enhanced the antimicrobial activity of PR, and provided a releasing channel for the delivery of polyphenols by attenuating the interactions between PCL and PR. Since all the materials used in this work are biodegradable and food contactable, it is expected that the developed material can be employed as food-grade antimicrobial packaging material.",

In order to derive a more precise conclusion, a meta-analysis was performed in this study by searching Medline, PubMed, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases. Finally, 17 studies including 12,019 cases and 10,747 controls were collected for this meta-analysis. The strength of association between ERCC2 Asp312Asn polymorphism and breast cancer risk was assessed by calculating crude ORs with 95% CIs. Overall, no significant associations between ERCC2 Asp312Asn polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility were found. In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, significant associations were observed for Asn/Asn versus Asp/Asp (OR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.32-0.96) and Asn/Asn versus Asn/Asp + Asp/Asp (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.90) in Asians. In the stratified analysis by study design, significant associations were found for Asn/Asn versus Asp/Asp (OR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.64-0.98) and Asn/Asn versus Asn/Asp + Asp/Asp (OR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.68-0.99) in population-based studies. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides an evidence that ERCC2 312Asn allele may have a protective effect for breast cancer development in Asians.",

        "abstract": "The Rho proteins are a class of small molecular GTPases that regulate multiple fundamental cellular processes by mediating the G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. Rhotekin, which is one of the downstream target molecules of Rho with a Rho binding motif class I domain, can inhibit endogenous or RhoGAP-stimulating Rho GTPase activity to regulate the signaling pathway. Here, a novel human cDNA containing an intact open reading frame that encodes 544 amino acids has been identified. As this putative protein shares 84. 6% amino acid identity with mouse Rhotekin, and has a tandem Rho binding domain class 1 and Pleckstrin homology domain, it was regarded as a human homologue of the mouse Rhotekin and assigned a symbol of RTKN. With the human Rhotekin cDNA as a probe, Northern hybridization revealed that a 4.0-kb transcript was expressed at a high level in prostate and at a middle level in 13 of 16 tissues examined, but it cannot be detected in liver and lung tissues. Meanwhile, a 2.4-kb transcript was expressed at a middle level in prostate and another 3.0-kb transcript in kidney. In addition, the RTKN gene was localized to chromosome 2p13 between markers D2S145 at 6.94 cR (LOD > 12) and D2S286 at 8.12 cR (LOD > 9.7) by radiation hybrid panel mapping. Compared with BAC clone AC005041 sequence, there were 12 exons for the RTKN gene and it spanned a 16.5-kb genomic region.",

        "abstract": "The Zipingpu Concrete Faced Rockfill Dam (CFRD) was obviously damaged during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. A wide range of dislocations occurred along the horizontal construction joints at EL. 845m, between the face slabs constructed in the second and third stages. The maximum displacement of the dislocations reached 17cm. In this study, the slab dislocations were investigated using finite element (FE) analysis. The method based on strain potential was applied to compute the permanent deformation of the Zipingpu Dam during the Wenchuan earthquake. The calculated magnitude of the slab dislocation showed good agreements with the field measurements. The dislocation mechanism was discussed. The results show that the dislocation of the concrete slab is a subsequent damage after the permanent deformation of the rockfill materials. The effects of the shear strength and the direction of the construction joints, the reservoir water level and the seismic waves were studied. The shear strength and the direction of the construction joints, reservoir water level and have a significant effect on the dislocation displacement. The dislocation can be effectively reduced by measures such as changing the direction of the construction joints or improving the shear strength at the horizontal joints.",

Human tumor cells treated with S7 showed dose-dependent inhibition of auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B on Thr232 and another widely-used marker specific for Aurora B kinase, the phosphorylation of Histone H3 (Ser 10), demonstrating endogenous Aurora B kinase activity were inhibited at cellular level.

        "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a pleiotropic cytokine which can regulate a wide variety of cellular responses. Low concentrations\n of TNFα seem to increase tumor growth and progression. The −308 G/A polymorphism in TNFα has been implicated in breast cancer\n risk but the published data remain inconclusive. In order to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis\n was performed by searching PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, CNKI, and Chinese Biomedicine Database. 11 studies\n including 10,184 cases and 12,911 controls were collected for TNFα −308 G/A polymorphism. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used\n to assess the strength of association between the TNFα −308 G/A polymorphism and breast cancer risk. The pooled ORs were performed\n for codominant model (GG versus AA; GA versus AA), dominant model (GG + GA versus AA), recessive model (GG versus GA + AA),\n and G allele versus A allele, respectively. Overall, significantly elevated breast cancer risk was found for recessive model\n (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.04–1.17) and for G allele versus A allele (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02–1.14). In the subgroup analysis\n by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were also found among Caucasians for recessive model and for G allele versus A\n allele (for recessive model: OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.04–1.17; for G allele versus A allele: OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.03–1.14).\n However, no significant associations were found among Asians for all genetic models. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests\n that the TNFα −308 G allele is a risk factor for developing breast cancer, especially for Caucasians.",

We demonstrated that expressions of CCT3 mRNA and protein are highly up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and high level of CCT3 is correlated with poor survival in cancer patients. In HCC cell lines, CCT3 depletion suppresses cell proliferation by inducing mitotic arrest at prometaphase and apoptosis eventually. We also identified CCT3 as a novel regulator of spindle integrity and as a requirement for proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment during mitosis. Moreover, we found that CCT3 depletion sensitizes HCC cells to microtubule destabilizing drug Vincristine. Collectively, our study suggests that CCT3 is indispensible for HCC cell proliferation, and provides a potential drug target for treatment of HCC.",

        "abstract": "Obesity and β-cell dysfunction due to oxidative stress impact the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We co-cultured 3T3L1 adipocytes and islet cells in the presence or absence of the antioxidant α-lipoic acid (LA) and assayed the effects of the adipocytes and LA on the secretion of insulin by the islet cells and on the activities of factors involved in secretion and oxidative stress. At low glucose concentrations (2.8 mmol/l), the presence of adipocytes (co-culture) increased insulin secretion compared with islet cells cultured alone (control) and this increase was diminished by LA (co-culture plus LA). At high glucose concentrations (22 mmol/l), insulin secretion levels were similar for all islet groups, resulting in a restoration of the stimulation index in the presence of LA. The mRNA levels of the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) genes glucokinase, glucose transporter 2 and Kir6.2 were downregulated under co-culture and co-culture plus LA conditions. Protein and tyrosine phosphorylation levels of insulin receptor-β and insulin receptor substrate-1 were decreased under co-culture conditions and were restored by LA treatment. Cellular malondialdehyde levels increased in the co-cultured islets and this increase was blocked by LA. The mRNA levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase were reduced under co-culture conditions and these reductions were eliminated by the addition of LA. In conclusion, 3T3L1 adipocytes disturb insulin secretion and induce islet dysfunction. The effects may be mediated by multiple pathways, which include downregulation of GSIS gene expression, suppression of islet cell insulin signaling and the induction of oxidative stress. LA may protect islet cells via activation of islet cell insulin signaling and the mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes.",

Here we reported the identification of a novel splicing variant of human 14-3-3 epsilon (14-3-3 epsilon sv), which is derived from a novel exon 1' insertion. The insertion contains a stop codon and leads to a truncated splicing variant of 14-3-3 epsilon. The splicing variant is translated from the exon 2 and results in the deletion of an N-terminal alpha-helix which is crucial for the dimerization. Therefore, the 14-3-3 epsilon sv could not form a dimer with 14-3-3 zeta. However, after UV irradiation 14-3-3 epsilon sv could also support cell survival, suggesting monomer of 14-3-3 epsilon is sufficient to protect cell from apoptosis.",

In our present work, we found that there exists a splicing variant of HMBOX1, designated HMBOX1b. Compared to HMBOX1, HMBOX1b encodes a 304 amino acids protein that shares the N-terminal region but has no homeodomain and the C-terminal region because\n of an alternative exon 7 which results in reading frame shifting. Unlike the highly pancreatic expression of HMBOX1, HMBOX1b was ubiquitous expressed in all human tissues detected by RT-PCR. Immunofluorescence staining showed that HMBOX1b accumulated\n in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and transcriptional reporter assays indicated that HMBOX1b only retained faint transcriptional\n repressive activity. Taken together, our findings suggest a distinct role of HMBOX1b, and the control of mRNA splicing might be involved in homeobox genes regulation.",

        "title": "Experimental study on the effect of interfacial tension on the conformance control of oil-in-water emulsions in heterogeneous oil sands reservoirs",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Reservoir heterogeneity is a serious problem for many mature oilfields. Due to heterogeneity, much of the displacing fluid may flow into the high permeability zones in the formation, leaving most of the low permeability areas un-swept, which leads to high water production and low oil recovery. In this work, oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions were used as conformance control agents to reduce fluid flow of the high permeability zones in heterogeneous oil sands reservoirs. As well, for the first time, interfacial tension (IFT) effect on emulsion conformance control performance was studied. Emulsification tests were first performed to screen suitable emulsifiers which could be used to prepare stable O/W emulsions with different IFTs. Physiochemical properties of the emulsions were investigated by characterization tests in terms of their stability behavior, droplet size distribution and rheological properties.  A series of heterogeneous parallel, dual-sandpack flow experiments were carried out to evaluate the profile control ability of emulsions with different IFTs of 0.04, 0.15, 0.92 and 5.20 mN/m in heterogeneous oil sands reservoirs. The results show that for the dual-sandpack models used in this study, emulsion conformance control performance gets better as IFT decreases from 5.20 mN/m to 0.15 mN/m, but it becomes worse as IFT further decreases to 0.04 mN/m. The fractional flow of the heterogeneous dual-sandpack diverts only once when flooded by an emulsion with an IFT of 5.20 mN/m. Emulsion with an IFT of 0.92 mN/m causes several flow diversions in the emulsion injection process, but the profile control ability could be destroyed by the flood of water. Emulsion with an IFT of 0.15 mN/m has good conformance control performance both at the emulsion flooding and subsequent water flooding stages, while emulsion with the least IFT of 0.04 mN/m shows very little profile control effect. The effect of emulsion slug size and sandpack permeability ratio on emulsion conformance control ability are also discussed in this paper.",

        "title": "The ancient function of RB-E2F pathway: insights from its evolutionary history.",
        "abstract": "The RB-E2F pathway is conserved in most eukaryotic lineages, including animals and plants. E2F and RB family proteins perform crucial functions in cycle controlling, differentiation, development and apoptosis. However, there are two kinds of E2Fs (repressive E2Fs and active E2Fs) and three RB family members in human. Till now, the detail evolutionary history of these protein families and how RB-E2F pathway evolved in different organisms remain poorly explored.We performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of E2F, RB and DP (dimerization partners of E2Fs) protein family in representative eukaryotic organisms. Several interesting facts were revealed. First, orthologues of RB, E2F, and DP family are present in several representative unicellular organisms and all multicellular organisms we checked. Second, ancestral E2F, RB genes duplicated before placozoans and bilaterians diverged, thus E2F family was divided into E2F4/5 subgroup (including repressive E2Fs: E2F4 and E2F5) and E2F1/2/3 subgroup (including active E2Fs: E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3), RB family was divided into RB1 subgroup (including RB1) and RBL subgroup (including RBL1 and RBL2). Third, E2F4 and E2F5 share more sequence similarity with the predicted E2F ancestral sequence than E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3; E2F4 and E2F5 also possess lower evolutionary rates and higher purification selection pressures than E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3. Fourth, for RB family, the RBL subgroup proteins possess lower evolutionary rates and higher purification selection pressures compared with RB subgroup proteins in vertebrates,Protein evolutionary rates and purification selection pressures are usually linked with protein functions. We speculated that function conducted by E2F4/5 subgroup and RBL subgroup proteins might mainly represent the ancient function of RB-E2F pathway, and the E2F1/2/3 subgroup proteins and RB1 protein might contribute more to functional diversification in RB-E2F pathway. Our results will enhance the current understanding of RB-E2F pathway and will also be useful to further functional studies in human and other model organisms.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant tumors worldwide, especially in Eastern China where HBV infection confirmed as the most important pathological element. HBV X gene, extremely easy to mutate and integrate into hepatocytes, plays a significant role in HBV infection and HCC development. We deduced that mutations of integrated HBx gene make transformation more malignant. The aim of the study was to investigate whether there were different mutation patterns between the HCC tissues and the pericarcinoma liver tissues (PCLT) from patients with HCC in Eastern China.HBx genes extracted from 287 HCC tissue samples and 195 PCLT tissue samples were analyzed by sequence alignment and stratified analysis with the matched medical records.Mutations occurred complicated and changeable in both HCC and PCLT. COOH-terminal truncation is more frequently found in HCC than PCLT (P < 0.05). There is no single site mutation of nucleic acid or amino acid makes distribution discrepancy between HCC and PCLT. Hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of amino acid of site 43, 47, 127, 131, 132 make distribution discrepancy between HCC and PCLT in men when stratified for gender (P < 0.05). Hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of amino acid of site 40 makes distribution discrepancy between HCC and PCLT in both male and female (P < 0.05). Hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of amino acid of site 47 and 127 make significant discrepancy among clinical stage I, II, III (P < 0.05).During the infection and replication of HBV, HBx mutates to adjust itself to the hepatocyte and increase the carcinogenesis. COOH-terminal truncated HBX may play a stimulative role in HBV-related HCC carcinogenesis as well as hydrophobic/hydrophilic character changes in some specific amino acid sites.",

        "title": "Phase transitions of maize starches with different amylose contents in glycerol–water systems",
        "abstract": "The phase transitions of maize starches with different amylose contents (3.4–82.9%) were systematically studied by DSC with stainless steel high-pressure pan under temperature scanning from 30 up to 200 °C. The results show that the distinct pattern of multiphase transitions of maize starch was not only determined by the amylose content, but also by glycerol–water mixture content (50 and 70%) and glycerol/water ratio (0/100, 10/90, 50/50, 90/10, and 100/0). Moreover, a big exothermic transition could be observed within the range of about 95–135 °C for all four maize starches mixed with pure glycerol, which was mainly due to the glycerol–starch –OH binding reaction and was greatly affected by the granular structure and molecular characteristics of maize starch (starch type). It has been shown that high temperature, adequacy of glycerol, and long storage time all favour the reaction of glycerol with starch molecules. Abbreviations T o onset temperature T p peak temperature T c conclusion temperature Δ T temperature range, i.e. T c − T o Δ H enthalpy Keywords Maize starch Thermal analysis Phase transitions DSC Amylose/amylopectin ratio Glycerol–water system 1 Introduction Starch is a natural polymer with particular properties unlike those of traditional polymers. As a heterogeneous material: it has macromolecular structures bound in a granular superstructure; it normally has both linear (amylose) and branched (amylopectin) molecules; and it contains both amorphous and crystalline regions within its granules ( French, 1984 ). When raw starch granules are heated in water, their semi-crystalline nature is gradually eliminated, resulting in structural breakdown and starch polymer dispersion in solution. This heat induced starch granular breakdown or the phase transition from an ordered granular structure into a disordered state in water is known as “gelatinisation” ( Ratnayake & Jackson, 2008 ). The gelatinisation process is essential in that it determines the proper conversion of starch in the processing of foods and emerging biodegradable starch-based materials. Since Stevens and Elton (1971) first utilised differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to measure gelatinisation and retrogradation of starch in 1971, it has become widely accepted as one of the most suitable techniques for the evaluation of starch thermal behaviours ( Liu, Xie, Yu, Chen, & Li, 2009 ). Many studies have shown that starch with water could experience complex multiphase transitions during DSC temperature scanning. For starch with excess water, a single gelatinisation endotherm (usually denoted G) can be usually observed in the low temperature range (54–73 °C) ( Donovan, 1979; Evans & Haisman, 1982; Russell, 1987; Wootton & Bamunuarachchi, 1979; Zobel, 1984 ). By reducing the water content (<64%) in starch, another endotherm, M1, which occurs at higher temperature and overlaps with G transition, can be observed ( Donovan, 1979; Russell, 1987 ). Based on the assumption that amylopectin molecules have a structure similar to that of a branched side-chain liquid-crystalline polymer of a smectic or nematic type, Waigh, Gidley, Komanshek, and Donald (2000) proposed that the first stage of gelatinisation (G) is related to the transition from smectic to nematic phase for B-type starches, and from smectic to isotropic phase for A-type starches. Swelling of the starch granules begins after completion of the first stage of gelatinisation. Further heating leads to the helix–coil transition associated with the unwinding of amylopectin double helices and loss of the starch granular birefringence, which is reflected as M1 endotherm in DSC results. However, at excess water conditions, both transitions involved in the two-stage mechanism occur either at the same temperature range, or the first stage of gelatinisation is a slow process that overlaps with the fast helix–coil transition. As a result, a single endothermic effect was observed on the calorimetrical traces. Besides G and M1, more endothermic peaks have also been observed at even higher temperature: M2, considered to be the phase transition within an amylose–lipid complex ( Biladeris, Page, Slade, & Sirett, 1985; Jovanovich & Añón, 1999; Raphaelides & Karkalas, 1988 ) and Z, attributed to the annealing of amylopectin crystallites during heating ( Maurice, Slade, Sirett, & Page, 1985; Russell, 1987 ). Furthermore, a weak exothermic process has been reported between two endothermic peaks at low temperature scanning rates ( Randzio, Flis-Kabulska, & Grolier, 2002; Vermeylen et al., 2006 ). This exothermic effect has been associated with the formation of novel hydrogen bonds with added water between unwounded amylopectin helices ( Waigh et al., 2000 ) or between amylose and outer branches of unwounded amylopectin helices ( Vermeylen et al., 2006 ). Among a variety of starch cultivars, maize starch has been of particular scientific interest since this kind of starch with different amylose/amylopectin ratios can be directly provided by the nature/agriculture. Much work has been done on the thermal transitions of various maize starches and it has been found that the endothermic pattern can be greatly affected by the amylose content ( Russell, 1987; Shogren, 1992; Stevens & Elton, 1971; Takahashi, Shiraai, & Wada, 1982; Von Eberstein, Hopcke, Konieczny-Janda, & Stute, 1980 ). By utilising a new DSC technique using high pressure stainless-steel pans, which allows temperature scanning of starch with high water content (∼75%) and at high temperature (∼360 °C) without loss of moisture, Liu, Yu, Xie, and Chen (2006) in our group systematically studied the phase transitions of maize starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios. They found that the number of endotherms and enthalpies depended on the amylose/amylopectin ratio and the moisture and lipid contents, and the gelatinisation enthalpy of the amylopectin-rich starch was higher than that of the amylose-rich starch. During the processing of starch-based foods and the preparation of thermoplastic starch (TPS), glycerol is frequently utilised with water or alone as a plasticiser due to its abilities of lowering mass viscosity during melting and improving the strength and flexibility of final products ( Liu et al., 2009 ). Besides, the low vapour pressure of glycerol makes the processing of starch more stable than pure water. There have been limited reports dealing with the thermal behaviours of maize starch in the presence of glycerol. For example, using simultaneous SAXS and WAXS and DSC to study the gelatinisation of waxy starch, Perry and Donald (2000, 2002) concluded that the glycerol concentration will not change the temperature range and enthalpy of gelatinisation peak although the endotherm is systematically shifted upwards; only the properties of the solution as a whole are of importance in determining gelatinisation behaviour. However, in a study of the gelatinisation of maize starches with different amylose contents over a range of water–glycerol concentrations, Tan, Wee, Sopade, and Halley (2004) revealed that the addition of glycerol increased the gelatinisation onset temperature with an extent that depended on the water content in the system; besides, the addition of glycerol promoted starch gelatinisation at low water content (0.4 g water/g dry starch) and the enthalpy of gelatinisation varied with glycerol concentration (0.73–19.61 J/g dry starch) depending on the water content and starch type. All of the past studies, however, concentrated on the single gelatinisation transition (G) with scanning temperature up to 150 °C at most. Since various, especially high-amylose, maize starches were widely used in the preparation of biodegradable starch-based materials in the presence of glycerol using various processing techniques at high temperature (∼200 °C) ( Liu et al., 2009 ), the understanding of the thermal multiphase transitions of maize starches under such conditions is of obvious interest. The present work aimed to systematically study the phase transitions of maize starches with different amylose contents during scanning up to 200 °C as functions of glycerol–water mixture content and glycerol/water ratio using DSC. The effect of storage time on the thermal behaviours of maize starches in pure glycerol was also investigated. The role of glycerol in the phase transitions of starch will be discussed here. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Four commercial maize starches with different amylose contents (waxy, 3.4%; regular, 24.4%; Gelose 50, 56.6%; and Gelose 80, 82.9%) were obtained from Penford Australia Limited (Lane Cove, NSW, Australia) and were used as model materials in the experimental work. Their amylose contents were determined previously ( Tan, Flanagan, Halley, Whittaker, & Gidley, 2007 ). The original moisture contents of these starches were 9–11%. Before use, starch samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for first 24 h and then at 110 °C for another 24 h to the moisture content level less than 1% (as determined by the weight loss). Glycerol, purchased from Taishan Yueqiao Reagent Plastic Co., Ltd. (China), was analytical grade at 99.5% purity. 2.2 Sample preparation Glycerol was mixed with distilled water in various ratios: 0/100, 10/90, 50/50, 90/10, and 100/0 (glycerol/water, w/w). Then, dried starch samples were mixed with the glycerol–water mixture at specific percentages (70% and 50%, dry basis) in a glass vial, and sealed and stored for at least 24 h for the equilibrium of the solvents. After that, the samples (about 7 mg, dry basis) were accurately weighed in high-pressure stainless steel pans (PerkinElmer No.: B0182901) for DSC measurements. 2.3 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) A PerkinElmer Diamond DSC with an internal coolant (Intercooler IP) and nitrogen purge gas was used in the experimental work. Melting point and enthalpies of indium and zinc were used for temperature and heat capacity calibration. The slow heating rate of 5 °C/min was used to minimise any temperature lag due to the large mass of the steel pan ( Yu & Christie, 2001 ). Samples were subjected to a heating scan from 30 °C to 200 °C at 5 °C/min. Each run was repeated at least twice to ensure the repetition of the results. 2.4 Microscopy A polarisation microscope (Axioskop 40 Pol/40 A Pol, ZEISS) was used to observe phase transition of starch samples with pure glycerol. After DSC scanning to specific temperatures, the starch samples were rapidly cooled to room temperature by DSC program to stop further changes. The starch sample was taken out of DSC pan and then dispersed using water. Then, starch suspension was sealed between two microscope glass slides using silicon adhesive. The same field was photographed under both normal and polarised lights. The magnification was 500 (50 × 10). At least three replicates were performed for each sample to ensure the consistent results. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Endothermic phase transitions of maize starches in glycerol–water systems Waxy maize starch is especially interesting since it contains mainly amylopectin molecules. The knowledge of thermal behaviours of waxy starch in the presence of glycerol can help us understand the phase transitions of other maize starches with high content of amylose in the same environment. Fig. 1 shows the DSC results of waxy starch with both 70% and 50% glycerol–water mixture contents. For each fixed mixture content, the glycerol/water ratio was varied in order to understand its effect on the thermal behaviour of waxy starch. It can be observed in Fig. 1 a that there was a single endothermic peak (G), attributed to the gelatinisation of amylopectin ( Liu et al., 2006; Perry & Donald, 2000, 2002; Tan et al., 2004 ), for waxy starch with 70% mixture content, with its position moving towards higher temperature with increasing glycerol concentration. When the glycerol concentration increased to 100% (glycerol/water ratio: 100/0), there was only an exothermic peak observed instead, which will be discussed in detail later. When the glycerol–water mixture content was lower (50%), the gelatinisation endothermic peak was split into two overlapping with each other (see Fig. 1 b). In this case, the G endotherm reflects the smectic-isotropic phase transition, and the additional endotherm (M1) at higher temperature reflecting the helix–coil transformation ( Waigh et al., 2000 ). Table 1 lists the detailed data describing the endothermic transitions in Fig. 1 . It can be noted in Table 1 that, when the mixture content was 70%, with glycerol/water ratio varying from 0:100 to 90:10, the onset ( T o ), peak ( T p1 ), and conclusion ( T c ) temperatures and the enthalpy (Δ H ) all moved to higher values. In addition, the thermal transition temperature range (Δ T = T c − T o ) also had an increasing trend, although the increments were small for 0/100, 10/90, and 50/50 (glycerol/water, w/w) samples. When the mixture content was 50%, T o , T p1 (G), T p2 (M1), T c , and Δ T also increased to higher values with increasing glycerol/water ratio. However, the maximum value of Δ H (G + M1) emerged at 10/90 glycerol/water ratio (see Table 1 ). Though the effect of glycerol concentration on the gelatinisation parameters has been studied before, the results were not consistent. Some researchers ( Evans & Haisman, 1982; Perry & Donald, 2000, 2002; van Soest, Bezemer, de Wit, & Vliegenthart, 1996 ) reported that increasing the concentration of glycerol solution only shift the gelatinisation endotherm upwards to higher temperature without affecting Δ T and Δ H . However, an increase of Δ H with increasing glycerol concentration was observed in another study ( Gunaratne, Ranaweera, & Corke, 2007 ). Moreover, others ( Habitante, Sobral, Carvalho, Solorza-Feria, & Bergo, 2008 ) reported a decreased Δ H with increased glycerol concentration measured by micro-DSC. On the other hand, there have also been discrepancies over the explanations of the effect of glycerol on starch gelatinisation. The main theories are: (1) glycerol has an “anti-plasticiser” behaviour and it hinders the gelatinisation process by diminishing the effectiveness of moisture contents of the starch to aid gelatinisation ( Evans & Haisman, 1982; Nashed, Rutgers, & Sopade, 2003 ); (2) glycerol–water solution as a whole affect the gelatinisation behaviour—lower molecular weight, lower viscosity and higher hydroxyl group density of the solution can improve starch gelatinisation ( Li, Sarazin, & Favis, 2008; Perry & Donald, 2000, 2002 ); and (3) glycerol increases the gelatinisation temperature by increasing the stability of starch amorphous regions ( Gunaratne et al., 2007 ) or the activation energy ( van Soest et al., 1996 ). It can be noticed in Fig. 1 that, with 70% mixture content, only one endothermic peak (G) was observed regardless of the glycerol/water ratio, while the starch with 50% mixture content showed separated but partially overlapped transitions (G and M1) irrespective of the glycerol/water ratio. If water is the sole gelatinisation agent, and glycerol has an “anti-plasticiser” behaviour acting preferentially to bind water and reducing the amount of water available to starch for gelatinisation, M1 transition should appeared at high glycerol/water ratio with 70% mixture content. This phenomenon, however, was not observed in Fig. 1 ; thus, glycerol should behave as a co-agent for starch gelatinisation. Besides, it can be noticed in Fig. 1 that, at each glycerol/water ratio (0/100; 10/90; 50/50; or 90/10), T o and T p1 showed little changes with varying mixture contents (70% and 50%). Similar phenomenon was observed in the study of starch gelatinisation with pure water, where the endotherm of G was shift to higher temperature only when the water content was at least below 52% ( Liu et al., 2006 ). As a result, both 70% and 50% mixture content can be considered to be “abundant” for the smectic-isotropic phase transition of amylopectin double helices (G) in the current study. As mentioned before, with 70% mixture content, T o , T p1 , T c , and Δ T all increased to higher values with increasing glycerol/water ratio. Thus, glycerol is considered not as effective as water for the G transition of starch due to its higher molecular weight and viscosity. However, higher temperature can enable glycerol to facilitate helix–coil transition and unwinding of amylopectin double helices to a greater extent, as evidenced by the increase of Δ H with higher glycerol/water ratio. However, for waxy starch with 50% mixture content, the higher glycerol/water ratios (50:50 and 90:10) resulted in broader Δ T and lower Δ H , suggesting the impediment and limitation of the helix–coil transition (M2). Fig. 2 shows the DSC results of regular maize starch with 70% and 50% glycerol–water mixture contents. With 70% mixture content, there were two endothermic peaks at 0/100 glycerol/water ratio, which were designated as G and M2 ( Liu et al., 2006 ). M2 has been considered as the phase transition within amylose–lipid complex ( Biladeris et al., 1985; Jovanovich & Añón, 1999; Liu et al., 2006; Raphaelides & Karkalas, 1988 ). When the glycerol/water ratio increased until 50/50, the G and M2 endotherms were shifted to higher temperatures, while Δ T was not changed. For enthalpy, the total Δ H (G + M2) was also increased, which was due to greater ability of glycerol at higher temperature to facilitate such transitions. When the glycerol/water ratio was further increased to 90:10, the G and M2 endotherms were considered to be merged as indicated by the broader Δ T (data not shown). Moreover, the enthalpy of M2 was increased with increasing glycerol/water ratio, suggesting that higher glycerol concentration was favourable for the phase transition within amylose–lipid complex. On the other hand, with 50% mixture content, there was an additional endotherm at 146 °C at 0/100 glycerol/water ratio, which was resulted from the annealing of the amylopectin crystallites during heating ( Liu et al., 2006; Maurice et al., 1985; Russell, 1987 ). When the glycerol/water ratio was increased to 50/50, G, M1, M2, and Z were shifted upwards and the Δ T value was increased; when the glycerol/water ratio was further increased to 90/10, G, M1 and M2 were merged as indicated by the broader Δ T , and Z disappeared in the experimental temperature range. Regarding to the enthalpy, the maximum value of Δ H (G + M1 + M2) occurred at 10/90 glycerol/water ratio, suggesting greater phase transitions at this level. Besides, the enthalpy of Z also increased with increasing glycerol/water ratio, suggesting that glycerol favours the annealing of amylopectin crystallites during heating. In both cases, the greatest enthalpy of G endotherm was observed at 90/10 glycerol/water ratio. In all, the distinct pattern of thermal transitions of regular maize starch was determined by the glycerol–water mixture content. Higher glycerol/water ratio tended to shift upwards and even merge the multiple thermal transitions. Fig. 3 demonstrates the DSC results of Gelose 80 with 70% and 50% glycerol–water mixture contents. With 70% mixture content, there was a broad endotherm, which was composed of the G and M2 transitions ( Liu et al., 2006 ). Higher glycerol/water ratio (up to 50/50 glycerol/water ratio) moved this shoulder upwards to higher temperature, but total Δ H (G + M2) and Δ T was stable. Finally the G and M2 endotherms were merged at 90/10 glycerol/water ratio. On the other hand, for Gelose 80 with 50% mixture content, Z transition emerged. Besides, G, M2, and Z were shifted to higher temperatures with the increase of glycerol/water ratio, but Δ T and Δ H were stable. When the glycerol/water ratio was increased to 90/10, only a weak G endotherm remained. For Gelose 80, higher glycerol/water ratio could not only shift the multiple thermal transitions upwards to higher temperature, but also suppress various thermal transitions. Similar thermal behaviours were observed for Gelose 50. 3.2 Exothermic phenomena of maize starches with pure glycerol As mentioned before, the DSC results of maize starches with pure glycerol (100/0 glycerol/water ratio) show a big exothermic peak (see Figs. 1–3 ). This exothermic phenomenon has also been observed in previous studies of starch with high concentration of glycerol ( Habitante et al., 2008; Perry & Donald, 2000; van Soest et al., 1996 ). van Soest et al. (1996) proposed that this exothermic peak was due to the starch–glycerol “interaction”. Perry and Donald (2000) suggested that self-assembly upon solvation of plasticiser like glycerol transforms the disordered structure of dry starch into an ordered smectic-like lamellar system with pronounced crystallinity, which is an exothermic reaction and can be greatly accelerated by increasing temperature; with water acting as the solvent, lamellar assembly and crystallisation can occur effectively and instantaneously at room temperature since water can easily penetrate the starch granules and effectively increase the free volume of amorphous regions. In this study, considering the exothermic peak is much bigger than the endothermic transitions (gelatinisation process), it could be proposed that the exothermic phenomenon for starch with high glycerol concentration is a combined result from both the starch–glycerol interaction and the solvation-assembly process in amylopectin structure. The former happens by the formation of –OH bonds between free –OH groups (which is not involved in the formation of starch–starch –OH binding) in starch molecules (both amylose and amylopectin) and –OH groups in glycerol molecules, releasing much more heat that the latter. The former could be the prerequisite of the latter and takes place during “solvation of plasticiser”. In order to understand if there was any gelatinisation process during the exothermic transitions for maize starches with pure glycerol, the samples were heated until the exothermic peak was concluded (but before, if any, following endothermic transitions) and then immediately cooled down to room temperature by DSC program, followed by microscopic observation. The results were shown in Fig. 4 . It is clearly demonstrated that, in all cases except regular maize starch with 70% glycerol content, the granular morphology were basically not changed and the Maltese crosses were still maintained, which means gelatinisation process did not happen during the exothermic transition. For regular maize starch with 70% glycerol content, the granules partially swelled and the Maltese crosses disappeared, which means regular maize starch could be gelatinised simultaneously with the exothermic transition. Fig. 5 illustrates the characteristic data of the exothermic peak of maize starches with different amylose contents with both 70% and 50% glycerol contents. It can be noticed in Fig. 5 that, the starch with 70% glycerol content generally showed an exothermic peak at higher temperature but a smaller enthalpy than that with 50% glycerol content. The reason could be that higher glycerol content (70%) could benefit starch–glycerol interaction (and subsequent self-assembly of starch crystallites) at room temperature during sample equilibrium (24 h storage); however, with more –OH group in the starch molecules bound with the –OH groups of glycerol, the remaining –OH binding reaction in the starch molecules should be more difficult due to the steric hindrance, and could only be initiated at higher temperature with such glycerol content level. On the other hand, with more limited content of glycerol (50%), small proportion of starch–glycerol –OH binding reaction happened before DSC temperature scanning, with remaining large proportion of reaction that required lower temperature to be started. These results demonstrate that both temperature and adequacy determine the activity of glycerol in the reaction with starch molecules. Fig. 5 also shows that the starch type (amylose content) had some effect on the temperature (onset and peak) and the enthalpy of the exothermic peak. With the increase of amylose content, the exothermic peak was shifted to higher temperature. Generally, the high-amylose maize starch granules have a more compact microstructure than that of low-amylose maize starches, which makes the former more solvent-resistant and thermally stable ( Chen, Yu, Kealy, Chen, & Li, 2007; Liu et al., 2006 ). It has also been revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) ( Chen et al., 2009 ) that there are many large channels connecting the border and the cavities at the hilum in low-amylose maize starch (waxy and regular maize starch) granules, while such channels do not exist for high-amylose maize starch (Gelose 50 and Gelose 80) granules. These could result in the less permeability of high-amylose maize starch that makes glycerol molecules less easy to penetrate into starch granules for starch–glycerol interaction. On the other hand, the change of exothermic enthalpy with amylose content did not see a simple trend. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the exothermic enthalpy of Gelose 50 was higher than both those of waxy maize starch Gelose 80. According to the data reported by Tan et al. (2007) , Gelose 50 has less double helix and crystallinity and more amorphous region than waxy maize starch, thus it contains more free –OH groups available for starch–glycerol –OH binding reaction. Besides, as discussed before, the more permeability of waxy maize starch made it easy for starch–glycerol –OH binding reaction; thus, more starch–glycerol interaction took place for waxy maize starch at room temperature before DSC measurement. However, compared with those of Gelose 50, Gelose 80 has relative larger proportion of V-type polymorph and lower proportion of amorphous regions ( Tan et al., 2007 ), which results in less free –OH groups of Gelose 80 available for starch–glycerol –OH binding reaction. The equilibrium of starch with plasticiser like glycerol after blending is a common practice in the production of starch-based foods and thermoplastics. Considering that the storage time may also affect the starch–glycerol –OH binding reaction and self-assembly of amylopectin crystallites, the effect of time on the thermal transitions of maize starches was also investigated in this study. The typical results are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen in Fig. 6 that the longer the storage time was, the lower both the temperature and the enthalpy of the exotherm were. For waxy starch samples with 70% and 50% glycerol contents, the exothermic peak still existed even after 4 weeks’ storage. Besides, a small gelatinisation transition was developed with time for waxy starch samples with 70% glycerol content, which was due to the self-assembly of crystallites. This result demonstrates again that the exothermic transition was mainly due to the starch–glycerol –OH binding reaction. On the other hand, for Gelose 80 with 50% glycerol content stored for the same period of time, the exothermic peak disappeared. This could mean that the starch–glycerol –OH binding reaction could be completed for Gelose 80 sample with 50% glycerol content after 4 weeks’ storage; for Gelose 80 sample with more glycerol content, more starch–glycerol –OH binding reaction could take place even after the same period of time. 4 Conclusion Each maize starch with different amylose content showed distinct pattern of multiphase transitions, which could be greatly affected by glycerol–water mixture content and glycerol/water ratio. Higher glycerol/water ratio tended to shift upwards and even merge the multiple thermal transitions. Glycerol behaved as a co-agent with water for starch gelatinisation. Higher temperature enabled glycerol to facilitate phase transitions of maize starch to a greater extent if abundant plasticiser was present. For maize starch with higher amylose content, this “abundant” level of plasticiser content could be higher. For all maize starches mixed with pure glycerol, a big exothermic transition could be observed within the range of about 95–135 °C, which was mainly due to the glycerol–starch –OH binding reaction and was greatly affected by the inherent granular structure and molecular characteristics of maize starch. The higher the amylose content of maize starch, the higher temperature was required to initiate the bulk starch–glycerol interaction. During the exothermic transition, gelatinisation process had not started for all four maize starches except regular maize starch with 70% glycerol content. Besides, both temperature and glycerol content determine the activity of glycerol in the reaction with starch molecules. This exothermic peak could also be affected by storage time, with its temperature and enthalpy of Gelose 80 decreased to a greater extent than those of any other maize starches. The results from this work have confirmed some previously reported results, and also addressed some earlier confusion. The better understanding of the phase transition of starch could be instructive to the thermal processing of starch-based foods and thermoplastics. References Biladeris et al., 1985 C.G.

The DSH locus was mapped to chromosome 1q21 and subsequently pathogenic mutations were identified in the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) gene in 2003.In this study, we performed a mutation analysis of the ADAR1 gene in eight Chinese families and one sporadic patient with typical DSH.PCR and direct sequencing of the ADAR1 gene were performed to identify and confirm the mutations in the eight families and the sporadic patient.Six novel and one known mutations were identified, including four missense mutations (p.K1105N, p.G1047R, p.F1099L, p.G1068R), two frameshift mutations (p.Q779fs-792x, p.P441fs-463x) and one nonsense mutation (p.R1096x).Six novel mutations were found in five unrelated families and one sporadic case, which have further improved our understanding on the role of ADAR1 in DSH. Interestingly, we failed to detect any mutations of ADAR1 in two families.",

        "abstract": "IL-2 is an important cytokine produced in T cells in response to Ag or mitogen stimulation. It is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. One of the key regulators of IL-2 mRNA stability is NF90. Upon T cell activation, NF90 translocates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it binds to the AU-rich element-containing 3′ untranslated regions of IL-2 mRNA and stabilizes it. Our previous work showed that CD28 costimulation of T cells activated AKT to phosphorylate NF90 at Ser647 and caused NF90 to undergo nuclear export and stabilize IL-2 mRNA. Phorbol ester (PMA) is a protein kinase C (PKC) activator. Through transcription activation and mRNA stabilization, IL-2 mRNA levels increase promptly when T cells are stimulated with PMA. However, how PMA stabilizes IL-2 mRNA was still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that PMA stimulation led to phosphorylation of NF90 at Ser647 via PKCβI. This phosphorylation was necessary for nuclear export of NF90 in response to PMA and for IL-2 mRNA stabilization. We show that phosphorylation at NF90-Ser 647 upregulated IL-2 production in response to PMA stimulation. Our results support a model in which PMA stimulation activates PKCβI to phosphorylate NF90-Ser647, and this phosphorylation triggers NF90 relocation to the cytoplasm and stabilize IL-2 mRNA. Thus, our study elucidates the mechanism by which PMA activates and stabilizes IL-2 expression in T cells. Copyright © 2010 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.",

        "abstract": "To provide genetic counseling and presymptomatic diagnosis to family members by investigating the genetic cause of a large primary juvenile open angle glaucoma (JOAG) pedigree with an autosomal dominant pattern.Ocular examinations were performed on all members of the pedigree in order to determine their disease status. Subjects were labeled as affected individuals, unaffected individuals, and suspects. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of the family members. Three exons of MYOC, 12 coding exons of OPTN, and two coding exons of CYP1B1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Direct DNA sequencing was used to identify mutations in MYOC, OPTN, and CYP1B1. Presymptomatic diagnoses were made for the consulters based on the results of both clinical examination and genetic analysis.One heterozygous mutation in the MYOC gene was identified in all patients of the pedigree. It was a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide 1,109, which corresponded to an amino acid residue change from proline to leucine at codon 370. The Pro370Leu mutation correlated with a severe JOAG phenotype as previously reported. Two adolescents, who were labeled as suspects, were detected to carry the same mutation and thus had a high risk of developing glaucoma. Close follow-up at regular intervals was recommended. In addition, no pathogenic mutations of OPTN and CYP1B1 were detected.The Pro370Leu mutation of the MYOC gene contributed to JOAG in this pedigree. Early onset, rapid development, poor response to medicine and high penetrance are characteristics of this mutation. Genetic analysis is valuable for providing genetic counseling and presymptomatic diagnosis to members in typical autosomal inheritance pedigrees with JOAG.",

Biodegradation was evaluated by composting under controlled conditions in accordance with AS ISO 14855. Thermal decomposition was studied by thermogravimetry (TGA). Morphological variations during biodegradation were investigated by SEM examination. It was found that biodegradation rates of PLA/starch blends and PLA/wood-flour composites were lower than that of pure cellulose but higher than that of pure PLA. The biodegradation rate was increased from about 60% to 80% when the starch content was increased from 10% to 40% after 80 days. Both starch and wood-flour accelerated thermal decomposition of PLA, and starch exhibited a relatively stronger affect then wood-flour. The decomposition temperature of PLA was decreased about 40 °C when the filler content was increased to 40%. Small polar molecules released during thermal decomposition of starch and wood-flour were attributed to the thermal decomposition behaviours of the PLA based blends and composites and their role is further discussed in this paper.",

Distributions of naphthalene vapor concentration and velocity in the spherical cluster are numerically predicted. The computed results indicate that the mass transfer of air to particles in the cluster is reduced due to the particle clustering and increments of particle size and temperature. Influences of the porosity of the cluster, inlet gas velocity and temperature on mass transfer of air to the cluster are analyzed. The mass transfer coefficients of gas to cluster increase with the increase of porosity of the cluster and inlet air velocity, but decrease with the particle diameter. The down-moving cluster gives higher mass transfer than that of the upward moving cluster. The computed Sherwood numbers are compared with the estimated values from empirical equations reported in literature.",

        "abstract": "SEPT2 plays an important role in cell division through its effect on cytoskeletons. It is a GTP-binding protein and can also form filament with SEPT6 and SEPT7. Knockdown of SEPT2, 6, and 7 causes stress fibers to disintegrate and then cells lose polarity and divide abnormally. Increasing evidence has shown that septins are related to the regulation of cell proliferation. In this study, the expression of SEPT2 was first identified to be up-regulated in human hepatoma carcinoma cells (HCC). In addition, SEPT2 was found to be phosphorylated on Ser218 by casein kinase 2 (CK2), which was also overexpressed in HCC. By overexpressing SEPT2 and its S218A mutant in SMMC7721 and L02 cell lines, we confirmed that the phosphorylation of SEPT2 on Ser218 by CK2 was crucial to the proliferation of HCC. These results suggest that SEPT2 might be a promising target for liver cancer therapy.",

The linear structure of amylose provides a modal material to understand how the starch microstructure affects on the decomposition mechanisms. Kinetics of the thermal oxidation has been studied using different methods. It is found that the thermal oxidation degradation is more complex than thermal degradation, thermal oxidation degradation kinetics of the starch can be interpreted in terms of multi-step degradation mechanism, the activation energies obtain from Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (F-W-O) method and modified Coats-Redfern method are in good agreement.

Studies investigating the association between TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and bladder cancer risk have reported conflicting results.All eligible studies were searched in PubMed. The quality of the studies was evaluated according to a predefined scale. Crude odds ratios, with the 95% confidence intervals, were assessed for the association using fixed- and random-effects models.We identified 10 case-control studies involving 3549 subjects for the present meta-analysis. Overall, no evidence of an association was observed between the TP53 genotypes and bladder cancer susceptibility when all the studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. However, a significantly decreased risk of bladder cancer was associated with TP53 genotypes for Arg/Arg versus Pro/Pro (odds ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.99) and Arg/Arg plus Arg/Pro versus Pro/Pro (odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.59-1.00) in Asians. In contrast, no effect of this polymorphism on bladder cancer in whites, Africans, or other population was observed when only high-quality scored studies were considered.The results of the present meta-analysis suggest that the TP53 Arg72 allele is a protective factor and that the Pro/Pro genotype might increase the susceptibility to bladder cancer in Asians. The conflicting findings among studies might have resulted from variations in the allele frequencies among the different races, as well as the methodologic quality of the studies.",

        "abstract": "Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1 (ALDH1L1) is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors, and its decreased expression is associated with the poor prognosis of HCC patients. We, therefore, evaluated the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ALDH1L1, and its mRNA expression on the survival of hepatitis B virus (HBV)‑related HCC patients and the association with tumor protein p53 (TP53) expression. ALDH1L1 SNPs in 415 HBV-related HCC patients were genotyped via direct sequencing. Expression profile chip datasets and survival information were obtained from GSE14520. The C allele (CT/CC) carriers of rs2276724 were significantly associated with a favorable prognosis [adjusted P=0.040; adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=0.725; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.533-0.986]. Joint-effect analyses suggested that the CT/CC genotype of rs2276724 in TP53-negative patients was significantly associated with a decreased risk of death, compared to the TT genotype of rs2276724 in TP53-positive patients (adjusted P=0.037; adjusted HR=0.621; 95% CI=0.396-0.973). Furthermore, low expression of ALDH1L1 predicted a poor prognosis for the HBV-related HCC patients (adjusted P=0.04 for disease-free survival; adjusted P=0.001 for overall survival). Patients with high ALDH1L1 expression and low TP53 expression were significantly associated with a decreased risk of recurrence and death, and patients with a high TP53 expression were also significantly associated with a decreased risk of death in HBV-related HCC, compared with low ALDH1L1 and low TP53 expression. Our results suggest that ALDH1L1 may be a biomarker for predicting postoperative clinical outcomes. Moreover, ALDH1L1-rs2276724 and mRNA expression were associated with TP53 expression in HBV-related HCC patients.",

The tensile strength of PLA/wood-flour micro-composites is almost independent of wood-flour content, suggesting\n only weak adhesion exists between the PLA matrix and the wood-flour particles. The addition of wood-flour resulted in an increase\n of up to 95% in the tensile modulus, in comparison with pure PLA, which showed a more resilient matrix. The addition of a\n coupling agent, methylenediphenyl-diisocyanate (MDI) to the composition resulted in an increase in tensile strength and tensile\n modulus of the micro-composites, of 10 and 135%, respectively, indicating enhanced matrix–particle interfacial adhesion. SEM\n and electron probe microanalysis provided evidence of improved interfacial adhesion between PLA and wood-flour particles from\n the addition of MDI. In contrast, addition of PEAA resulted in a micro-composite displaying substantially reduced tensile\n strength, up to 35% and a slightly increased in impact strength, up to 15%, consistent with the introduction of the rubbery\n PEAA component into the polymeric matrix. No evidence for increased matrix–particle adhesion was found for the PLA/wood-flour\n micro-composites containing PEAA.",

        "abstract": "Dicarbonyl/l-xylulose reductase (DCXR), mainly catalysing the reduction of α-dicarbonyl compounds and l-xylulose, belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Its enzyme activity can be inhibited by short-chain fatty acids. In this study, a novel DCXR inhibitor named (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was reported. First, we overexpressed recombinant human DCXR in Escherichia coli, purified the enzyme by affinity chromatography and measured its activity. The inhibition effects of EGCG and its analogues on DCXR were determined subsequently, and EGCG showed the strongest inhibition with 50% inhibition concentration value of 78.8 μM. The surface plasmon resonance analysis also indicated that the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) reached to 7.11 × 10(-8) M, which implied a high affinity between EGCG and DCXR. From enzyme kinetic analysis, EGCG acted as a mixed inhibitor against its forward and reverse substrates and the coenzyme, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). However, the inhibition is pH dependent. The molecular docking finally showed that EGCG formed several hydrogen bonds with the Thr190 residue of DCXR, and the model was further verified by site-directed mutagenesis. Therefore, EGCG is a potential inhibitor to human DCXR.",

The effects of pre-gelatinization and cross-linking on the swelling and enzymatic degradation of maize starch as well as the release rate of drug from the matrix tablets were examined. Cross-linked pre-gelatinized maize starches were prepared by double modification of pre-gelatinization and cross-linked with POCl(3), and bovine serum albumin was used as a model drug. For in vitro drug release assays, the resistant starch matrix tablets were incubated in simulated gastric fluid, simulated intestinal fluid and simulated colonic fluid, respectively. The content of resistant starch and swelling property of maize starch were increased by pre-gelatinization and cross-linking, which retarded its enzymatic degradation. Drug release studies have shown that the matrix tablets of cross-linked pre-gelatinized maize starch could delivery the drug to the colon. These results indicate that the resistant starch carrier prepared by pre-gelatinization and cross-linking can be used for a potential drug delivery carrier for colon-targeting drug matrix delivery system.",

In this paper, we reported the cloning of human SGKL, which encodes a protein sharing 67 and 66% amino acid identity with rat sgk and human SGK, respectively. A 4.4-kb transcript of human SGKL was detected in 16 human tissues examined and was found to be most abundant in lung.

Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), which catalyzes the condensation reaction between farnesyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate, is the key enzyme for synthesizing GGPP. We report the isolation of a gene transcript showing high homology withDrosophila GGPPS cDNA. The transcript is 1 466 bp in length and contains an intact open reading frame (ORF) ranging from nt 239 to 1 138. This ORF encodes a deduced protein of 300 residues with calculated molecular weight of 35 ku. The deduced protein shows 57.5% identity and 75% similarity withDrosophila GGPPS, and contains five characteristic domains of prenyltransferases. Northern hybridization revealed that humanGGPPS was expressed highest in heart, and moderately in spleen, testis, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas. No obvious bands were detected in other examined tissues. TheGGPPS gene was located on human chromosome 1q43 by Radiation Hybrid mapping method. It was proved that there was a putative predisposing gene for prostate cancer in this region, and that analogs of GGPP can inhibit the geranylgeranylation of p21rap protein in PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. These facts suggest thatGGPPS may be one of the candidate genes for prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) protein inhibitors are emerging as promising anticancer therapies. The gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-binding adaptor speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is the most frequently mutated in primary prostate cancer. Here we demonstrate that wild-type SPOP binds to and induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4) by recognizing a degron motif common among them. In contrast, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants show impaired binding to BET proteins, resulting in decreased proteasomal degradation and accumulation of these proteins in prostate cancer cell lines and patient specimens and causing resistance to BET inhibitors. Transcriptome and BRD4 cistrome analyses reveal enhanced expression of the GTPase RAC1 and cholesterol-biosynthesis-associated genes together with activation of AKT-mTORC1 signaling as a consequence of BRD4 stabilization. Our data show that resistance to BET inhibitors in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer can be overcome by combination with AKT inhibitors and further support the evaluation of SPOP mutations as biomarkers to guide BET-inhibitor-oriented therapy in patients with prostate cancer.",

Six and 5 alleles were found in Chinese Han people for D21S215 and D21S120, respectively, with observed heterozigosities of 0.68 and polymorphic information content PIC, 0.67 and 0.65. For 17 Down syndromes whose parental origin of the extra chromosome 21 were known, meiotic origin of the extra chromosome 21 were determined in 16 cases, with 7 and 4 maternal meiosis I and II nondisjunction, 2 and 3 paternal meiosis I and II, respectively. The possible biological significance of the study on origin of the extra chromosome 21 has been discussed.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy is a conserved cellular process that degrades and recycles cytoplasmic components via a lysosomal pathway. The phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-conjugation of the Atg8 protein plays an important role in the yeast autophagy process. In humans, six Atg8 homologs, including MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B, MAP1LC3C (refer to LC3A, LC3B, and LC3C hereafter), GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2 have been reported. All of them can be conjugated to PE through a ubiquitin-like conjugation system, and be located to autophagosomes.In this study, we found 3 new alternative splicing isoforms in LC3B, GABARAP, and GABARAPL1, (designated as LC3B-a, GABARAP-a and GABARAPL1-a, respectively). None of them can go through the PE-conjugation process and be located to autophagosomes. Interestingly, compared with LC3B, LC3B-a has a single amino acid (Arg68) deletion due to the NAGNAG alternative splicing in intron 3. Through structural simulations, we found that the C-terminal tail of LC3B-a is less mobile than that of LC3B, thus affecting its C-terminal cleavage by human ATG4 family proteins. Furthermore, we found that Arg68 is an essential residue facilitating the interaction between human Atg8 family proteins and ATG4B by forming a salt bridge with Asp171 of ATG4B. Depletion of this salt bridge reduces autophagosomes formation and autophagic flux under both normal and nutrition starvation conditions.These results suggest Arg68 is an essential residue for the C-terminal cleavage of Atg8 family proteins during the autophagy process.",

        "abstract": "This work investigated the effect of shear on the starch degradation, with a particular focus on the changes in molecular and lamellar structures. Corn starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios (waxy corn starch, or WCS: 1:99; normal corn starch, or NCS: 25:75; and Gelose 80 starch, or G80: 80:20) were used as model materials to be processed using a Haake twin-rotor mixer for different times. Molecular and lamellar structural analysis was performed using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The degree of damage of starch at the granule level was evaluated by an assay kit. The results showed that amylose molecules in starch granules did not change significantly, while amylopectin molecules degraded to a stable size caused by the shear treatment. The average thickness of semi-crystalline lamellae disappeared rapidly during processing. A typical positive deviation from Porod’s law at a high q region was observed, attributed to the presence of thermal density fluctuations or mixing within phases. Nonetheless, the degree of mixing within phases for the processed samples was lower than the native starch. The study of the mass fractal structure indicated that the scattering objects of the processed starches were more compact than those of the native counterparts. Furthermore, waxy corn starch (containing mostly amylopectin) experienced the greatest granule damage than the other starches. All the results showed that the rigid crystal structure in amylopectin is more sensitive to the shear treatment than the flexible amorphous structure in amylose. This mechanistic understanding at the microstructure level is helpful in designing the processing of starch-based foods or plastics with desired functional properties.",

        "abstract": "The interfacial microcracks in the resin matrix composites are difficult to be detected and repaired. However, the self-healing concept provides opportunities to fabricate composites with unusual properties. In the present study, photothermal conversion Ag-Cu2S nanoparticles were immobilized onto poly(p‑phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers via a polydopamine chemistry. Benefit from the photothermal effects of Ag-Cu2S, the obtained PBO fibers (Ag-Cu2S-PBO) efficiently converted the light energy into heat under a Xenon lamp irradiation. Then, single PBO fiber composites were prepared using thermoplastic polyurethane as matrix. It was found that the interfacial damage caused by single fiber pull-out was simply self-healed by Xe light irradiation. This wonderful interfacial damage self-healing property was mainly attributed to the in-situ heating generation via photothermal effect of Ag-Cu2S in the composite interface. This paper reports a novel strategy to construct advanced composites with light-triggered self-healing properties, which will provide inspiration for preparing high performance composite materials.",

        "title": "Codon 249 mutation in exon 7 of p53 gene in plasma DNA: maybe a new early diagnostic marker of hepatocellular carcinoma in Qidong risk area, China.",
        "abstract": "One of the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Qidong area is the selective mutation resulting in a serine substitution at codon 249 of the p53 gene (1, 20), and it has been identified as a \"hotspot\" mutation in heptocellular carcinomas occurring in populations exposed to aflatoxin and with high prevalence of hepatitis B virus carriers (2,3,9, 10,16,24). We evaluated in this paper whether this \"hotspot\" mutation could be detected in cell-free DNA circulating in plasma of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis in Qidong, China, and tried to illustrate the significance of the detection of this molecular biomarker.We collected blood samples from 25 hepatocellular carcinoma patients, 20 cirrhotic patients and 30 healthy controls in Qidong area. DNA was extracted and purified from 200 microl of plasma from each sample. The 249(Ser) p53 mutation was detected by restriction digestion analysis and direct sequencing of exon-7 PCR products.We found in exon 7 of p53 gene G-T transversion at the third base of codon 249 resulting 249(Arg) - 249(Ser) mutation in 10/25 (40 %) hepatocellular carcinoma cases, 4/20 (20 %) cirrhotics, and 2/30 (7 %) healthy controls. The adjusted odds ratio for having the mutation was 22.1(95 % CI, 3.2-91.7) for HCC cases compared to controls.These data show that the 249(Ser) p53 mutation in plasma is strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in Qidong patients. We found this mutation was also detected, although it was at a much lower frequency, in plasma DNA of Qidong cirrhotics and healthy controls; We consider that these findings, together with the usual method of HCC diagnosis, will give more information in early diagnosis of HCC, and 249(Ser) p53 mutation should be developed to a new early diagnostic marker for HCC.",

        "abstract": "The discovery and optimization of a series of 2-N-aryl-substituted benzenesulfonamidoacetamides as novel tubulin polymerization inhibitors are described. Pharmacophore exploration of hit compound AH-487 identified the optimal structure of N-heteroaryl-2-(4-methoxy-N-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)phenylsulfonamido)acetamide as a potent antimitotic agent. Subsequent lead compounds 4b and 4c, with N-4-aminophenyl and N-1H-indol-5-yl substitutions at the acetamide position, respectively, were shown to induce cell-cycle arrest at the G(2) /M phase and lead to an accumulation of HeLa cells in the sub-G(1) phase. More significantly, these lead compounds (3c, 4b, and 4c) exhibit impressive cytotoxicity against a panel of cancer cells including P-glycoprotein-overexpressing MDR-positive cells, with potency greater than or equal to clinically studied benzenesulfonamide E7010. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that derivatives of AH-487 disrupt mitotic spindles by inhibiting microtubule polymerization and induce apoptosis via induction of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in tumor cells. The optimized leads 4b and 4c strongly inhibited the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a mouse xenograft model.",

The membrane wall's metal temperature was measured at different heights, of 3 circulating fluidized bed boilers, of different capacity, and with different working medium temperatures within the pipes. The heat transfer through the water walls was then analyzed by the finite element method, wherewith the distribution of the coefficients of heat transfer from gas, in the combustion chamber, to the water wall was then obtained.

A transcription experiment revealed that TCP10L was a transcription factor with transcription inhibition activity. In this study, the human MAD4 was identified to interact with TCP10L by a yeast two-hybrid screen. This finding was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and subcellular localization experiments. As MAD4 is a member of the MAD family, which antagonizes the functions of MYC and promotes cell differentiation, the biological function of the interaction between TCP10L and MAD4 may be to maintain the differentiation state in liver cells. Also, we propose that the up-regulation of Myc is caused by the down-regulation of TCP10L in human hepatocarcinomas.",

After the stable cell lines were screened, we compared the secretion rate between native fusion protein and modified fusion protein, purified fusion protein through Protein A+G affinity chromatography column and investigated the bioactivity of fusion protein. The results showed that recombinant vectors encoding fusion protein hK-Fc and hK'-Fc were constructed successfully; CHO cell lines stably secreting fusion protein were obtained, the yield is higher than 11 mg/L; Secretion rate was enhanced by 5-10 times after the signal peptide of fusion protein was modified; Fusion protein has enzymatic activity in vitro. The above results could promote the following researches on serum half-life of the fusion protein and develop a new stroke medicine with better clinical efficacy.",

        "abstract": "P73 is a structural and functional homologue of p53, and plays an important role in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis. A potentially functional polymorphism (designated as p73 G4C14-to-A4T14) has been identified in a region in exon 2 of the p73 gene, which may theoretically form a stem-loop structure and thereby affect p73 expression. Several investigations have reported the correlation between p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism and cancer risk. However, the results are inconclusive. To further assess the association between p73 polymorphism and cancer risk, we performed meta-analysis of the data sets obtained from 26 individual studies involving 8,148 cancer patients and 8,150 controls. The association between p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism and cancer risk was determined by crude odd ratios (OR) with 95% CI (confidential interval). AT-allele carriers were found to have a significantly increased risk of cervical cancer (AT/GC vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.14-2.33; AT/AT + AT/GC vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.05-2.10), colorectal cancer (AT/AT vs. AT/GC + GC/GC, OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.25-3.12), head and neck cancer (AT/AT + AT/GC vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.06-1.96) and other cancers (AT/AT vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.24-2.57; AT/AT vs. AT/GC + GC/GC, OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.26-2.56). In the stratified analysis of ethnicity, a significantly elevated cancer risk was found in Caucasians (AT/AT + AT/GC vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.08-1.30; allele AT vs. allele GC, OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.24). No significant association of p73 polymorphism with the cancer risk of smoking was detected by stratified analysis by smoking status. Together, our data suggest that the p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 may be a risk factor of cancer especially in Caucasians.",

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel human GDPD domain-containing gene, GDPD5, isolated from human testis cDNA library, and mapped to 11q13.4-13.5 by searching the UCSC genomic database. The GDPD5 cDNA sequence of 3442 base pairs contains an open reading frame encoding 605 amino acids. The GDPD5 gene consists of 17 exons and encodes a putative protein with six transmembrane regions and a GDPD motif. Subcellular localization of GDPD5 demonstrated that the protein was localized in the cytoplasm when overexpressed in COS-7 cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that GDPD5 was widely expressed in human tissues and the expression levels in kidney and prostate were relatively low.",

Interestingly, present work indicated that GDF3/Gdf3 genes were expressed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus as well as in cerebellum, as revealed by RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunostaining. Results of RT-PCR in 10 human tissues and 12 rat tissues indicated that GDF3/Gdf3 genes were abundantly transcribed in both human and murine brain, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry results revealed that in cerebral cortex, GDF3 was evenly distributed. In hippocampus, it was expressed in most of the neurons in CA2 and DG region, especially only in a restricted number of neurons in the regions of CA1 and CA3 and in Purkinje cells in cerebellum. Present data suggested that GDF3 might play important roles in the central nervous system (CNS), especially in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, and it shed new light on further research of GDF3 in the central nervous system.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of tumor‑related mortalities worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs have been reported to be associated with tumor initiation, progression and prognosis. The present study aimed to explore the association between long noncoding RNA LINC00668 and its co‑expression correlated protein‑coding genes (PCGs) in HCC. Data of 370 HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were used for analysis. LINC00668 and its top 10 PCGs were selected to determine their diagnostic and prognostic value. Molecular mechanisms were explored to identify metabolic processes that LINC00668 and its PCGs are involved in. Prognosis‑related clinical factors and PCGs were used to construct a nomogram for predicting prognosis in HCC. A Connectivity Map was constructed to identify candidate target drugs for HCC. The top 10 PCGs identified were: Pyrimidineregic receptor P2Y4 (P2RY4), signal peptidase complex subunit 2 (SPCS2), family with sequence similarity 86 member C1 (FAM86C1), tudor domain containing 5 (TDRD5), ferritin light chain (FTL), stratifin (SFN), nucleolar complex associated 2 homolog (NOC2L), peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), cancer/testis antigen 2 CTAG2 and leucine zipper and CTNNBIP1 domain containing (LZIC). FAM86C1, CTAG2 and SFN had significant diagnostic value for HCC (total area under the curve ≥0.7, P≤0.05); LINC00668, FAM86C1, TDRD5, FTL and SFN were of significant prognostic value for HCC (all P≤0.05). Investigation into the molecular mechanism indicated that LINC00668 affects cell division, cell cycle, mitotic nuclear division, and drug metabolism cytochrome P450 (all P≤0.05). The Connectivity Map identified seven candidate target drugs for the treatment of HCC, which were: Indolylheptylamine, mimosine, disopyramide, lidocaine, NU‑1025, bumetanide, and DQNLAOWBTJPFKL‑PKZXCIMASA‑N (all P≤0.05). Our findings indicated that LINC00668 may function as an oncogene and its overexpression indicates poor prognosis of HCC. FAM86C1, CTAG2 and SFN are of diagnostic significance, while FAM86C1, TDRD5, FTL and SFN are of prognostic significance for HCC.",

In\n this study, we identified a novel human gene named RAP2C, isolated from human testis cDNA library, and mapped to Xq26.2 by searching the UCSC genomic database. The RAP2C cDNA contains an open reading frame of 552 bp, encoding a putative protein of 183 amino acid residues. The predicted protein\n contains a RAS domain. By RT-PCR analysis in various tissues, RAP2C was found to be principally expressed in the liver, skeletal muscle, prostate, uterus, rectum, stomach, and bladder and to\n a less extent in brain, kidney, pancreas, and bone marrow. RAP2C protein was located in cytoplasm when overexpressed in COS-7\n cells. Reporter gene assays showed that overexpression of RAP2C in HEK293T cells activated the transcriptional activities\n of serum response element (SRE). These results indicate that RAP2C is a novel member of the Ras family, belonging to the Rap\n branch of small GTPase proteins and may be involved in SRE-mediated gene transcription.",

Firstly, a novel concept, interval kernel, is proposed. It establishes a relationship between interval type-2 fuzzy membership and hybrid kernel. According to it, a particular interval type-2 fuzzy inference system is built, which abandons traditional type reduction procedure and utilizes directly defuzzification after inference. Subsequently, the model optimization is realized via a hybrid learning mechanism involving two sub-algorithms: bottom-up simplification algorithm and quadratic programming combined with back propagation algorithm. At last, simulation results show that the interval type-2 fuzzy model obtained possesses nice generalization and transparency.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies and a major cause of cancer involved death worldwide. Prognosis remains poor because of high recurrence rates and lack of effective relapse prevention strategies. Notch pathway plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis, and it is associated with the prognosis of cancer. A total of 465 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients who underwent surgery were enrolled. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of Notch pathway receptors were genotyped using Sanger DNA sequencing. Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazards regression model were adopted to analyze the association of polymorphisms and mRNA expression with clinical and pathological features, respectively. Four SNPs (rs1043996 in Notch3 and rs422951, rs520692, rs3830041 in Notch4) were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) (P = 0.023, P = 0.042, P = 0.028, and P = 0.001 respectively). Patients carrying the AA genotype in rs1043996 and TT/TC genotypes in rs422951 and rs520692 significantly decreased risks of death, compared to those carrying the AG/GG genotype in rs1043996 and CC genotype in rs422951 and rs520692, respectively. Patients carrying the TT genotype in rs3830041 showed poorer OS, compared with those carrying the TC/CC genotype. A haplotype block (rs422951 was in strong LD with rs520692, r  = 0.843) was identified in Notch4. Notch3 mRNA expression significantly increased in tumor tissue, compared with nontumor normal tissue (P < 0.0001). Moreover, higher expression of Notch3 was associated with poorer OS (HR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.32-3.37, P = 0.002) and shorter recurrence time of HBV-related HCC (HR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.31-2.93, P = 0.001). Our findings collectively indicate that Notch receptors variants (rs1043996 in Notch3 and rs422951, rs520692, rs3830041 in Notch4) are independent predictive targets for OS in HBV-related HCC patients. Notch3 expression is a potential prognostic biomarker of OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) prediction in HBV-related HCC patients following surgical treatment.",

        "abstract": "several reports of studies of the degradation pattern of starch from different sources based on the differential thermal analysis. 3-5 Dehydration and decomposition have generally been considered as the main two processes associated with the degradation mechanisms of starch in an open system. 2,6,7 The study of starch degradation with different water contents in a sealed system is very important because water is the most important additive during the thermal processing of starch in many cases, such as extrusion. However, it is difficult to monitor the degradation of starch with higher moisture content in an open system, especially its decomposition at higher temperature because the moisture will evaporate without a sealed system. Recently we developed a new technique to study the thermal degradation of starch using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in a sealed system with a stainless steel high pressure pan and a gold-plated copper seal. 8 In this work, the thermal decomposition of cornstarches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios (waxy: 0:100; maize: 23:77; Gelose 50: 50:50; Gelose 80: 80:20) were studied by DSC in a sealed system with varying water contents (9-75%). Glucose was used to confirm the mechanisms of starches.",

        "abstract": "We have performed a homozygous deletion screen on 268 candidate genes in 90 human tumor cell lines derived from multiple types of cancers. Most of the candidate genes investigated have been proposed to be involved in cellular processes that are germane to cancer progression, such as cell cycle control, genome maintenance, chromatin remodeling, cell adhesion, and apoptosis. We have detected novel homozygous deletions affecting four independent loci: Brahma-related gene (SMARCA4) on chromosome 19p in the TSU-Pr1 prostate and A427 lung carcinoma lines, Map Kinase Kinase 3 (MAP2K3) on 17q in the NCI-H774 lung tumor cell line, TMPRSS2 on 21q in the Bx PC-3 pancreatic carcinoma line, and Cadherin 6 (CDH6) on 5p in the SK-LU-1 lung carcinoma line. Subsequent analyses of the coding sequences of these four genes using cDNAs from a panel of tumor cell lines revealed multiple sequence variants. The results of this mutation study serve to demonstrate the feasibility of performing high-throughput screens of candidate genes in tumor cell lines to identify genes that may be targeted for mutation during the development of cancer. © 2001 Academic Press.",

S39 is a novel potent inhibitor of Aurora B kinase with the IC50 90.07 nM in the biochemical assay in an ATP competitive manner. S39 treatment on human tumor cells can inhibit the phosphorylation of Histone H3 (Ser10), a direct downstream substrate of Aurora B kinase, indicating S39 inhibits endogenous Aurora B kinase activity in cell-based level. Furthermore, S39 treatment blocks cell proliferation, inhibits colony formation and induces apoptosis in a wide range of human tumor cell lines. These results indicate that S39 is a potential lead compound to be an Aurora B inhibitor.",

That is, Linking the annealed UP-Linker to the YAC DNA digested with Alu I after isolation by pulse field gel electrophresis (PFGE), then amplifying and labelling the YAC DNA by PCR using universal primer (UP). Because the restriction sites of Alu I are very frequent in the human genome and UP (25nt) is much longer than Linker (11nt), the probes generated by UP PCR can cover the full length of inserted DNA and PCR amplification itself can achieve changes from extensiveness to specificity. FISH on lymphocytes using human chromosome 21 probes prepared by UP PCR gives bright hybridization signals and correct numbers of chromosome 21 in more than 98.4% of interphase nuclei and 99.6% of metaphases, respectively.",

It is used as a molecular marker for the regional specification of the neocortex. In this study, a cDNA was isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The cDNA (LXN) contains an open reading frame encoding 222 amino acids. The comparison between the deduced amino acid sequences of LXN and latexins of rat and mouse revealed high sequence identity (84.2 and 84.7%, respectively). Northern blot analysis showed that LXN was expressed as a transcript of 1.3 kb in 15 out of 16 tissues examined, except in peripheral blood leukocyte. The expression levels were high in heart, prostate, ovary, kidney, pancreas, and colon, moderate or low in other tissues including brain. It is noteworthy that the tissue distribution of human LXN differs greatly to that of its homologue in the model animal, rat latexin. In addition, the LXN gene contains at least 6 exons and spans 5.9 kb according to the genomic sequence of the clone RP11-79M21 and the gap sequence cloned in this paper. LXN was assigned to 3q25-q26.2 according to the position of the marker SHGC-35682 found adjacent to LXN gene.",

Eighteen Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were inoculated intrapleurally with 1×10(6) MSCs-DAPI. The distribution of the fluorescent cells was observed using fluorescent microscopy for the following 30 d. Another 12 rats inoculated intrapleurally with 1×10(6) MSCs-GFP were observed for 14 d.The isolated cells were typical MSC phenotypes and could differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondroblasts in vitro. Microscopic analysis revealed that the labeled cells adhered to the surface of the pleural cavity. The highest number of the labeled cells was found to be adhered to all specimens from the mediastinal pleura, but no labeled cells were detected in the lung parenchyma or other tissues/organs, such as the liver, kidney, spleen, and mesenterium. Incidentally, stomas were found in the mediastinal pleura. The recovered MSCs-GFP from the pleural cavity retained their ability to adhere and proliferate.We have established a novel method for intrapleural delivery of MSCs. The distribution of intrapleurally delivered MSCs was found to be limited to the pleurae and the pleural cavity, thereby providing us with a new approach to further investigation of the therapeutic roles of MSCs in pleural diseases.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the main factor, which induces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Qidong high-risk area, China. To prevent HBV infection is the most important strategy to inhibit the HCC carcinogenesis. A large project was performed in Qidong area to protect newborn babies from the HBV infection that 80,000 children born between 1984 and 1990 were vaccinated. After three times of follow-up studies, 15 screened children were found to have symptoms of illness showing persistent elevation of serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT). From these previously collected data, we found that the ALT levels of five vaccinees with negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were significantly higher than those of 10 vaccinees with positive HBsAg. Furthermore, with the passage of time, the difference of ALT levels between the two groups (HBsAg negative and positive groups) diminishes. After cloning and sequencing of the HBsAg \"a\" epitope coding sequences, we found that mutations in \"a\" epitope were correlated with the absence of detectable anti-HBsAg, while no mutations were seen in the anti-HBsAg positive infections. We also found that majority of point mutations were occurred in the coding sequences of the first loop structure in \"a\" epitope. The structure of double loop conformation in \"a\" epitope was conservative, and important for HBV antigenicity. These changes in a double loop conformation would escape neutralization by vaccine-induced antibody.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the relationship between primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) in the Chinese Han population and its candidate locus GLC3C. 152 nuclear families (patients with normal parents) without carrying the CYP1B1 mutation were enrolled. Fluorescence Labeled Multiplex-PCR was used to genotype 12 short tandem repeats (STRs) within GLC3C region and transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to analyze the association between PCG and these STR markers. Sixteen haplotype tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) were chosen from the location where the TDT tests showed positive results. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to perform SNP genotyping Haplotypes constructed from these SNPs were analyzed. The TDT results of STRs in the GLC3C area indicated that D14S279, D14S555 and D14S74 have significant transmission disequilibrium signals (p=0.0210, 0.0096 and 0.0034), with a genetic distance of 0.006 cM among them. Significant transmission disequilibrium (P=0.0010) occurred between the haplotype TAACG of rs2111701- rs4020123- rs4903696- rs11159318- rs177216 and the disease. Detection of disease causing genes within this region needs further study.",

        "abstract": "We have previously studied mouse Cdv (carnitine deficiency-associated gene expressed in ventricle)-1 related gene Cdv-1R and its human counterpart CDV-1R, and revealed that mouse Cdv-1R was predominantly expressed in testis by multiple tissue northern analysis. To further localize the Cdv-1R mRNA in mouse testis and epididymis tissue, in situ hybridization study was reported in this article. In the adult mice, the Cdv-1R expression was intensively found in the epithelial cells of the caput and corpus epididymis, whereas it was moderately detected in the initial segment, and weakly in the cauda epididymis. In the seminiferous tubles of the testis, no obvious hybridization signals were observed above the background level. This Cdv-1R region-specific expression pattern in the epididimis suggests Cdv-1R may play an important role in sperm maturation. Moreover, considering the Cdv-1R has a similar expression distribution in epididymis to the OCTN2, it would appear that Cdv-1R might be involved in the carnitine pathway in the epididimis. © 2005 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",

Therefore, quick detection for ozone of part per million (ppm) levels is significant for living environment and an excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) compound has been synthesized. Due to an intrinsic excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process, this “off-on” probe can fluoresce in the solid-state. This intrinsic fluorescent property makes it easy to detect lower concentration of ozone since the reaction product of probe can avoid being affected by pH and solubility through luminescence in the solid-state. The limit of gaseous ozone detection can be as low as 0.28 ppm for obviously distinguishable fluorescence colour from blue to cyan, showing that the probe can be useful for detecting ozone without the need of elaborate equipment.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorylation of protein kinases (PKs) plays a central role in the signal transduction of cells by transferring a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the side chains of particular serine, threonine or tyrosine residues of substrates. Previous studies have shown that Mg 2+ ions are crucial for the formation of transition state of phosphoryl transfer reaction. However, the roles of Mg2+ ions in other steps of phosphorylation remain poorly understood. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of ATP with PKs in the presence and the absence of Mg2+ ions in the active sites, respectively. Affinity analysis showed that the binding-free energies of ATP to the PK active sites in the presence of Mg2+ ions are lower than those in the absence of Mg2+ ions, suggesting that Mg2+ ions in the active sites could enhance the binding affinities of ATP to the PKs. This enhancement is mainly attributed to the electrostatic interactions induced by Mg2+ ions. Thus, this study shows that Mg2+ ions also play a very important role in the binding of ATP to PKs, and thereby gains a better understanding of how Mg2+ ions function in protein phosphorylation. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

Breast cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of recombinant human GDF3 protein. Using lentivirus containing sh-RNA, we knocked down the expression of GDF3. Soft agar assay was performed to explore the effects of GDF3 on colony formation. Different anti-tumor drugs dealt with MCF-7 cells stably expressing GDF3.We found that GDF3 expression level was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues compared to the surrounding nontumorous tissues. GDF3 proteins could inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells. We also found that the knockdown of GDF3 resulted in the promotion of colony formation and enhanced the ability of anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar. Furthermore, overexpression of GDF3 could promote the apoptosis induced by Taxol.Our data indicated that GDF3 expression is significantly decreased in human breast cancer tissues, and reconstitution of GDF3 in breast cancer may be a potential therapeutic approach to inhibit aggressive growth of breast cancer.",

The locus of GLYCTK gene is mapped to 3p21. PCR amplification in seventeen human tissue cDNAs revealed that both GLYCTK1 and GLYCTK2 are expressed widely almost in all these tissues. The expression of mouse Glyctk in various tissues was demonstrated by in situ hybridization. Both GLYCTK1 and GLYCTK2 proteins are localized in cytosol, and GLYCTK2 proteins are specifically localized in mitochondria.

        "abstract": "Cholecystokinin modulates the release of dopamine and dopamine-related behaviours in the mesolimbic pathway, where cholecystokinin and dopamine coexist in dopaminergic neurones. Because cholecystokinin and its receptors (A and B) have a functional interaction with dopaminergic neurotransmission, alterations in them may constitute a predisposition for Parkinson's disease. We performed a case-control study to investigate the association between the cholecystokinin system and Parkinson's disease using genetic markers for three genes: cholecystokinin and its two receptors (A and B). One hundred and sixty patients with Parkinson's disease and 160 controls, matched for age, gender, ethnic origin and area of residence, were recruited. Cholecystokinin -45C>T, cholecystokinin-A receptor 779T>C and cholecystokinin-B receptor 1550G>A gene polymorphisms were studied using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. These three gene polymorphisms showed no correlation with risk of Parkinson's disease; however, the cholecystokinin CT/TT genotype was associated with a 4.429-fold increased risk for visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease. Cholecystokinin-A receptor and B receptor polymorphisms, considered alone, showed no correlation with hallucinations in Parkinson's disease; however, a combined effect was found in patients with hallucinations harboring both the cholecystokinin CT/TT and cholecystokinin-A receptor TC/CC genotypes. Parkinson's disease patients harboring this genotype have a 5.922-fold increased risk for developing visual hallucinations. These results suggest that, in Chinese, visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease are associated with cholecystokinin -45C>T polymorphism, and this association was still observed in the presence of the cholecystokinin-A receptor TC/CC genotype, indicating a possible interaction of these two genes in the visual hallucinogenesis in Parkinson's disease.",

Based on the reduced set-vector, we present a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model (RVTSFM) which alternatively extracts reduced set-vectors for generating fuzzy rules. The product-type multidimensional fuzzy membership functions of rule-antecedents can be directly generated by Mercer kernels; and the nonlinear functions represent the rule-consequents. By utilizing the bottom-up simplification algorithm and insensitive learning, we can effectively identify the model structure and parameters. The final model derived provides a desirable accuracy and generalization performance, as well as a highly transparent rule base. Finally, the proposed fuzzy model is successfully applied to the approximation of a two-dimensional sinc function, and the fuzzy control of a ball-and-beam system.",

A spot was detected from human tears using 2D gel electrophoresis and was identified as HLysG2 using MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and a MASCOT search with a matching score of 140 and 27% sequence coverage of the whole amino acid sequence. To gain insight into the in vitro antimicrobial activities of HLysG2, the mature peptide-coding region was cloned into Pichia pastoris for heterogeneous expression. Recombinant HLysG2, had an optimal at pH 6.0 and 30 °C, reached the peak activity of 1.2 × 10(4)U/mg at the sodium ion concentration of 75 mM and showed a higher salt tolerance than human c-type lysozyme (HLysC).

The results show that PBSA and PLA are immiscible, but their interface can be improved by processing conditions. In particular, their interface and the resulting mechanical properties strongly depend on processing temperature. When the temperature is below 120 °C, the bound between PBSA and PLA fiber is weak, which results in lower tensile modulus and strength. When the processing temperature is higher (greater than 160 °C), the relaxation of polymer chain destroyed the molecular orientation microstructure of the PLA fiber, which results in weakening mechanical properties of the fiber then weakening reinforcement function. Both tensile modulus and strength of the composites increased significantly, in particular for the materials reinforced by long fiber. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

        "abstract": "Cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) plays a role in the vertebrate visual process as a substrate-routing protein. It belongs to a widespread lipid-binding SEC14-like protein family. All the members of the family have the lipid-binding domain called CRAL-TRIO. Here we have isolated a new human CRAL-TRIO domain containing a CRALBP-like (CRALBPL) gene from the cDNA library of human adult brain. The CRALBPL gene consisted of 1,694 bp and had an ORF encoding putatively 354 amino acids with a CRAL-TRIO domain from 118 to 279 aa. The expression pattern in 18 human tissues indicated that CRALBPL gene was mainly expressed in brain. The alignment of CRAL-TRIO domain showed that CRALBPL had 45% identity with human CRALBP. Subcellular location revealed that CRALBPL protein was located in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Western blotting indicated that the CRALBPL had a molecular weight of about 40 kDa.",

The elastomer foam has closed and uniform cell structure with density about 90 g/L. Narrow size distribution with average cell diameter 32 μm were obtained. The foamed balls show rubbery properties and can recover well (u003e90%) to their original shape quickly after releasing press stress. Cell growth needs to take place at melting state where the migration and orientation of polymer chains are permanently kept without remained force of springback. Some unique phenomena were observed during foaming the elastomer: post-expansion (about 40%) was obtained after removing the foamed samples from a cylinder mold, which results in forming a ball rather than a cylinder like the mold. This phenomenon was explained by the lower glass transition temperature of the elastomer, in which residual CO2 foam continuously in the room temperature; and “memory” of internal strength. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To seek candidate compounds that inhibit the growth of liver cancer, components of Chloranthus serratus were tested. Here, we report that shizukaol D, a dimeric sesquiterpene from Chloranthus serratus, exerted a growth inhibition effect on liver cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We demonstrated that shizukaol D induced cells to undergo apoptosis. More importantly, shizukaol D attenuated Wnt signalling and reduced the expression of endogenous Wnt target genes, which resulted in decreased expression of β-catenin. Collectively, this study demonstrated that shizukaol D inhibited the growth of liver cancer cells by modulating Wnt pathway.",

Combustion in CFB is a complicated process, which is connected with the gas-solid flow and its heat and mass transfer. A simplified model of single char particle combustion was suggested in this paper, where the particle was assumed shrank. The collection efficiency of cyclone, oxygen concentration distribution, and mass transfer resistance were all considered. The numerical simulation results of carbon content in fly ash for different particle size for varies char agreed well the measurement from the CFB boiler for the same coal, which proves the reliability of the model. This model can explain the peak in carbon content in fly ash distribution vs. particle size. With this model, it can be indicated that there is a peak in the carbon content in fly ash distribution for varies particle size, where the diameter ranges from 20 to 50 micron, increasing the bed temperature or excess air ratio in the outlet of the furnace, the carbon content in fly ash could be decreased. While increasing the collection efficiency of the cyclone, the carbon content increases very little. This proposed us the limitation of the fly ash recirculation.",

        "abstract": "Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant cancer. It is a challenge to develop anti-HCC drugs due to HCC's extreme aggressiveness and with the sensitivity of the liver to show severe adverse effects. More importantly, the precise mechanisms causing HCC pathogenicity are not known. Our previous study disclosed Nogo-B as a reticulon 4 (Rtn4) family member. In the present study, we first identified that Nogo-B played a critical role in HCC progression. We found, via in vitro and in vivo assays, that Nogo-B was expressed aberrantly in primary HCC tumor tissues and immortal HCC cells but was relatively scarce in the normal liver tissues or cells. Nogo-B knockout, via the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, resulted in significant suppression of HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Next-generation sequencing analysis showed that Nogo-B knockout have effects on interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathway. Furthermore, we observed that IL-6 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) in wild-type HCC cells, but Nogo-B knockout could reduce IL-6-induced increase of pSTAT3, supporting that Nogo-B affects HCC tumor progression possibly via regulating the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, Nogo-B is expressed aberrantly in HCCs and plays an oncogenic role. These findings support that Nogo-B may be a novel anti-HCC therapeutic target.",

The crosstalk between ubiquitination and acetylation of p53 prompts us to examine whether acidic domain is essential for MDM2 to regulate the acetylation of p53. We find that the acidic domain of MDM2 is necessary to inhibit p300-mediated acetylation of p53 as well as to mediate the deacetylation of p53. Our results indicate that acidic domain of MDM2 provides essential information for acetyltransferase p300 and deacetylase HDAC1 and is indispensable for MDM2 to negatively regulate the acetylation of p53.",

With the recent advances in the field, the functions of these proteins become diverse in many organisms. In particular, the number of known mammalian septin family members has increased dramatically. They are now known to have many cellular roles such as cytokinesis, polarity determination, vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics. Recently, more and more data suggest that some septin family members participate in the pathogenesis of different diseases including neoplasia, neurodegeneration and infections. These make the research of septins a hallmark in cell biology and pathology. In this review, we will summarize the major research progresses about septins in their classification, structure, biological function and the relationship with human diseases.",

Many evidences have indicated that some septins were abnormally expressed in certain kinds of tumors and the altered expressions were related to the process of carcinogenesis. To better understand the relationship between septins and cancer, we compared the expression of 14 human septin family members in 35 kinds of tumor types with their normal counterparts using the publicly available ONCOMINE microarray database. We found altered expression of most septin members in many kinds of tumors. Significantly, SEPT2, SEPT8, SEPT9, SEPT11 were consistently up-regulated, and SEPT4, SEPT10 were down-regulated in most cancer types investigated. Furthermore, the abnormal expressions were also in accordance with the tumor malignancies or prognosis of corresponding cancer patients. These findings have contributed to the view that septins may belong to a kind of cancer critical genes. More septins might act as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in cancer development.",

CYPA has been implicated in several pathological processes, including cancer, inflammatory diseases, and HIV-1 infection. Up-regulation of CYPA has been found to be a common phenomenon in several tumor types, including in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of CYPA in tumor cells remains unknown. We generated a stable SK-Hep1 cell line and studied the CYPA regulated genes at the transcriptome level. The microarray results reveal that CYPA can up-regulate the expression of many cytokine and drug resistance related genes. Furthermore, we showed that the elevated CYPA expression contributes to drug resistance. We postulate that the over-expression of CYPA in tumors may play a role in clinical resistance to chemotherapy.",

MDMX, the MDM2 homologous protein, inhibits p53-mediated transcription activity. The interplay between MDM2, MDMX, Pirh2 and COP1 has not been reported, except the interaction between MDM2 and MDMX. Here, we reported that there were interactions between these four proteins independently of p53. The protein levels of MDM2, MDMX, Pirh2 and COP1 changed when any two of them were co-transfected. Our data also showed that the integrity of MDM2 RING finger domain was crucial for its ability to elevate the protein levels of COP1 and Pirh2. Any two of these four proteins could inhibit p53-mediated transcriptional activity synergistically. Furthermore, COP1 inhibited MDM2 self-ubiquitination and interfered with MDMX ubiquitination by MDM2. Our results suggest that MDM2, MDMX, Pirh2 and COP1 might inhibit p53 activity synergistically in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Septins, a conserved family of cytoskeletal GTP-binding proteins, were presented in diverse eukaryotes. Here, a comprehensive phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis for septin proteins in metazoan was carried out. First, we demonstrated that all septin proteins in metazoan could be clustered into four subgroups, and the representative homologue of every subgroup was presented in the non-vertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis, indicating that the emergence of the four septin subgroups should have occurred prior to divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates, and the expansion of the septin gene number in vertebrates was mainly by the duplication of pre-existing genes rather than by the appearance of new septin subgroup. Second, the direct orthologues of most human septins existed in zebrafish, which suggested that human septin gene repertoire was mainly formed by as far as before the split between fishes and land vertebrates. Third, we found that the evolutionary rate within septin family in mammalian lineage varies significantly, human SEPT1, SEPT 10, SEPT 12, and SEPT 14 displayed a relative elevated evolutionary rate compared with other septin members. Our data will provide new insights for the further function study of this protein family.",

        "abstract": "An investigation into the effects of starch on both, UV photo-oxidative degradation and biodegradation, of HDPE was focused on the interface between HDPE and starch using Synchrotron-FTIR microscope (SFTIR-M) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Carbonyl group detection by FTIR was conducted to evaluate the effect of degradation following exposure to UV photo-oxidative degradation. The results showed that the concentration of carbonyl groups on the interface were higher, suggesting the role of starch in accelerating the UV photo-oxidative degradation of HDPE. The interface between HDPE and starch was further observed under SEM to study the morphological changes after UV photo-oxidative degradation and biodegradation. Micro-cracking was observed on the interface between starch and HDPE after UV photo-oxidative degradation. Tensile testing after UV exposure showed that the variation rate of elongation was higher for the samples containing starch. Starch, an easily biodegradable material, can also act as initial source of nutrients for micro-organisms (bacteria, fungi, and algae) in the blend materials thus enhancing their biodegradability. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with the initiation and progression of human tumors. DNA microarrays are widely used to explore the expression patterns of miRNAs. Because of the limited sample size and experimental expense, the statistical power of individual research projects is not sufficient to yield a robust conclusion. However, collected microarray datasets of expression profiles provide opportunities to compile the information of individual studies. Our study carried out a comprehensive meta-analysis of miRNA expression microarray datasets from 28 published tumor studies; it comprises 33 comparisons and nearly 4,000 tumor and corresponding nontumorous samples. This work reports 52 miRNAs as common signatures that are dysregulated in tumors. In addition to the commonly altered miRNAs, five solid cancers displayed specific tissue patterns of altered miRNAs as well. The meta-analysis also revealed some novel tumor-related miRNAs such as hsa-miR-144, hsa-miR-130b, hsa-miR-132, hsa-miR-154, hsa-miR-192 and hsa-miR-345. We further validated the expression pattern of hsa-miR-154 in human hepatocellular carcinoma by RT-PCR. Restoration of intracellular miR-154 inhibited tumor cell malignance and the G(1)/S transition in cancer cells. Both bioinformatic prediction and western blotting demonstrated that miR-154 could target CCND2. In addition, expression patterns of miR-154 were inversely correlated with those of CCND2 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, this study used a large-scale data analysis to identify a qualified list of miRNAs that are consistently changed in tumors, which could lead to a better understanding of human tumor etiology.",

Although progress has been made recently, the biological function of ZNF191 remains largely unidentified. The aim of this study was to establish a ZNF 191 transgenic mouse model, which would promote the functional study of ZNF191.Transgene fragments were microinjected into fertilized eggs of mice. The manipulated embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant female mice. The offsprings were identified by PCR and Southern blot analysis. ZNF 191 gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. Transgenic founder mice were used to establish transgenic mouse lineages. The first generation (F1) and the second generation (F2) mice were identified by PCR analysis. Ten-week transgenic mice were used for pathological examination.Four mice were identified as carrying copies of ZNF191 gene. The results of RT-PCR showed that ZNF 191 gene was expressed in the liver, testis and brain in one of the transgenic mouse lineages. Genetic analysis of transgenic mice demonstrated that ZNF 191 gene was integrated into the chromosome at a single site and could be transmitted stably. Pathological analysis showed that the expression of ZNF 191 did not cause obvious pathological changes in multiple tissues of transgenic mice.ZNF 191 transgenic mouse model would facilitate the investigation of biological functions of ZNF191 in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Fluorescent quantum dots of carbon and semiconductor have superior optical properties and show great potential in sensing applications. This paper reports a novel method for rapid detection of uranyl ions via ratiomedtric fluorescence signals by employing the two types of quantum dots as the key materials. As the most soluble and stable toxic uranium species, uranyl has been recognized as an important index for nuclear industrial wastewater. However, its on-site, rapid and sensitive determination remains challenging. This work uses the ratiometric fluorescent signal of quantum dots and combines a smartphone-based handheld device for on-site and rapid detection of uranyl. The ratiometric fluorescent probe is achieved by integrating carbon dots (C-dots) and CdTe quantum dots (MPA@CdTe QDs) through chemical hybridization. The presence of uranyl ions greatly quenches the red ﬂuorescence of the CdTe QDs, whereas the green ﬂuorescence keeps constant, leading to obvious color change. An App and a 3D-printed accessory have been developed on a smartphone to analyze and calculate the content of uranyl on the basis of captured fluorescence signals from a test strip with immobilized probe. This new designed mobile detection system displays good analytical performance for urnayl ions in wide concentration range from 1 μM to 150 μM, which shows great potential application in controlling the nuclear industrial pollution.",

Through data mining, a novel human gene, CAGLP (calglandulin-like protein) was predicted and subsequently isolated from human skeleton muscle. The open reading frame of CAGLP is 543 bp in length, coding a putative Ca2+ binding protein with four EF-hand motifs. The deduced amino acid sequence of CAGLP displays high similarity with Bothrops insularis snake protein calglandulin (80%). The results of PCR amplification using cDNA from 17 human tissues indicated that human CAGLP is expressed in prostate, thymus, heart, skeleton muscle, bone marrow and ovary. Functional CAGLP::EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) fusion protein revealed that CAGLP accumulated through-out Hela cells. Western blot using anti-EGFP antibodies indicated that the CAGLP protein has a molecular weight of about 19 kD. A phylogenetic tree showed that CAGLP and calglandulin may be orthologous proteins representing a distinct group in the EF-hand proteins.",

The influence of the amylose/amylopectin ratio on the internal structures and morphologies could be revealed by these techniques. Sharp growth ring structures could be clearly identified for high-amylopectin starches by CLSM and SEM following acid treatment. CLSM allowed the visualization of cross-sections of starch granules without the need for sectioning techniques that lead to destruction of the microstructure of sample, allowing exploration of the gelatinization mechanism. Three-dimensional images of starch granules during gelatinization could be constructed to further explore phase transition mechanisms. It was found that the granules of waxy maize and normal maize starch subsequently break through at their cavity and channels, when the granules became swollen during gelatinization, whilst the granules of G50 and G80 remain granular and break down to smaller pieces.",

NATs might play important roles in gene expression and translation regulation. Present work investigated the presence of NATs of Alzheimer's disease associated genes including PRESENILIN1, PRESENILIN2, BACE1, BACE2, APP, APOE, TAU (MAPT), PRION, alpha-SYNUCLEIN (SNCA), NICASTRIN, PEN2, APH1A, APH1B as well as CD147 (BASIGIN), and the results revealed that APP, BACE2, APH1A, TAU, CD147 and alpha-SYNUCLEIN contain natural antisense transcripts. These NATs were characterized according to the sense-antisense overlapping information and potential functional mechanisms were proposed. Present findings provide preliminary but important information about transcription regulation of AD associated genes, which would further our understanding of the gene expression regulation of AD, and also suggest a novel potential strategy for the therapy of AD.",

The temperature-induced changes of the cornstarch granules in excess of water were also studied under CLSM. Acid hybridization of starch by HCl was used to enhance the difference between amorphous and crystalline ranges. It was found that the high-amylose starches (G50 and G80) were brighter than those of low-amylopectin starches (waxy and maize) under confocal laser light, and the average (decreasing) fluorescence intensity sequence of the granules was G80 > G50 > maize > waxy. Waxy and maize starches showed clear internal cavities and channels, whilst G50 and G80 had bright cores. Sharp growth ring structures can be clearly observed for low-amylose starches (waxy and maize) after acid hydrolysis. Gelatinization of all starches starts at the hilum and the adjacent of the channels, and spreads rapidly to the periphery. This work is the first time that three-dimensional images of partly gelatinized granules have been constructed and presented from different confocal images, which allows further exploration of the mechanisms of gelatinization.

        "abstract": " is one of the important pathogens causing severe incurable canine babesiosis, suggesting the necessity to develop a sensitive, specific, and highly automated diagnostic method for clinical application. Surface proteins are ideal candidates for diagnostic targets because they are the primary targets for host immune responses during host-parasite interactions. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are abundant on the surface of parasites and play an important role in parasite diagnosis. In this study, a GPI-anchored protein named BgGPI47-WH was obtained and mouse anti-rBgGPI47-WH polyclonal antibody was produced by immunizing mice with the purified protein and Freund's adjuvant. Western blot was used to identify the native form and immunogenicity of BgGPI47-WH. An ELISA method was established by using recombinant BgGPI47-WH protein to evaluate its potential as a diagnostic antigen and the established method exhibited high specificity. The antibody response was evaluated by using the -infected sera collected from different experimental dogs and the established ELISA could recognize antibodies at day 6 until day 101 post infection, indicating the potential use of BgGPI47-WH for early stage diagnosis. The specificity of the established ELISA was further evaluated by using 147 clinical samples collected from animal hospitals and 17.0% (25/147) of the samples were tested positive, with an overall proportion agreement of 86.39% between the results from BgGPI47-WH and BgSA1. Our results indicated that BgGPI47-WH could be used as a reliable diagnostic antigen and this study has proposed a practical method for early diagnosis of .",

Most small-molecule PARP inhibitors developed to date have been against PARP1, a poly-ADP-ribose transferase, and suffer from poor selectivity. PARP16, a mono-ADP-ribose transferase, has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic target, but its inhibitor development has trailed behind. Here we newly characterized epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as a potential inhibitor of PARP16. We found that EGCG was associated with PARP16 and dramatically inhibited its activity . Moreover, EGCG suppressed the ER stress-induced phosphorylation of PERK and the transcription of unfolded protein response-related genes, leading to dramatically increase of cancer cells apoptosis under ER stress conditions, which was dependent on PARP16. These findings newly characterized EGCG as a potential inhibitor of PARP16, which can enhance the ER stress-induced cancer cell apoptosis, suggesting that a combination of EGCG and ER stress-induced agents might represent a novel approach for cancer therapy or chemoprevention.",

Then sandpack flow experiments were conducted, and permeability reduction tests were used to quantify the plugging performance of each of the different emulsions flowing at different flow rates through sandpacks. The results showed that the plugging effect of an oil-in-water emulsion was primarily due to the special flow behaviors of emulsion droplets in porous media; that is, the bulk viscosity of an emulsion contributed very little to the plugging effect. This paper has shown, for the first time, a correlation of emulsion plugging ability and interfacial tension. Permeability reduction of oil-in-water emulsions in sandpacks increased with an increase in interfacial tension and droplet size.

The cornstarches with different amylose contents (waxy 0; maize 23, G50 50 and G80 80) were used as model materials. The high heating speed (up to 300 °C/min) allows the weak T g of starch to be visible and the true T g was calculated by applying linear regression to the results from different heating rates. It is confirmed for the first time, that the higher the amylose content is, the higher the T g is for the same kind of starch. The sequence of true T g of cornstarch is G80 > G50 > maize > waxy when samples contain the same moisture content, which corresponds to their amylose/amylopectin ratio. It was found that T g was increased from about 52 to 60 °C with increasing amylose content from 0 to 80 for the samples containing about 13% moisture. The microstructure and phase transition were used to explain this phenomenon, in particular the multiphase transitions that occur in high-amylose starches at higher temperatures, and the gel-ball structure of gelatinized amylopectin.",

        "abstract": "Cassava starch-based superabsorbent polymer was successfully synthesized using a new technology that based on modification of a Haake twin-roll mixer as reactor. The cassava starch was first gelatinized then modified by grafting under external shear stress in the reactor. The torque and temperature curves as a function of time can reflect the variations in the reactor and also offer some information about the copolymerization reaction. The advantages of this system include starch modification can be carried out (1) with high starch concentration, (2) under controlled time and (3) smaller amount of sample (60 g) required. The technology provides useful guides for reactive extrusion. The starch grafted composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA was also used for determining the percentage of grafting ratio. The results show that the cassava starch has been successfully grafted with acrylamide then crosslinked by ,′-methylene-bisacrylamide using this reactor. The ultimate water absorbent capacity of the cassava-based superabsorbent polymer impacted by various pH values illustrated that the acid and basic solutions inhibit the ability of imbibing water. Additionally, gel properties of the cassava-based superabsorbent polymer were investigated. It can be concluded that the structure of cassava gel is stable, while the three dimensional network of cassava-based superabsorbent polymer is rigid but its structure could not resist external force effectively and everlastingly since ′ was decreased with increasing amplitude.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one the most common malignancies and has poor prognosis in patients. The aim of the present study is to explore the clinical significance of the main genes involved in the Janus kinase (JAK)‑signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in HCC. GSE14520, a training cohort containing 212 hepatitis B virus‑infected HCC patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas as a validation cohort containing 370 HCC patients, were used to analyze the diagnostic and prognostic significance for HCC. Joint‑effect analyses were performed to determine diagnostic and prognostic significance. Nomograms and risk score models were constructed to predict HCC prognosis using the two cohorts. Additionally, molecular mechanism analysis was performed for the two cohorts. Prognosis‑associated genes in the two cohorts were further validated for differential expression using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction of 21 pairs of hepatitis B virus‑infected HCC samples. JAK2, TYK2, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5B had diagnostic significance in the two cohorts (all area under curves >0.5; P≤0.05). In addition, JAK2, STAT5A, STAT6 exhibited prognostic significance in both cohorts (all adjusted P≤0.05). Furthermore, joint‑effect analysis had advantages over using one gene alone. Molecular mechanism analyses confirmed that STAT6 was enriched in pathways and terms associated with the cell cycle, cell division and lipid metabolism. Nomograms and risk score models had advantages for HCC prognosis prediction. When validated in 21 pairs of HCC and non‑tumor tissue, STAT6 was differentially expressed, whereas JAK2 was not differentially expressed. In conclusion, JAK2, STAT5A and STAT6 may be potential prognostic biomarkers for HCC. JAK2, TYK2, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5B may be potential diagnostic biomarkers for HCC. STAT6 has a role in HCC that may be mediated via effects on the cell cycle, cell division and lipid metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Protein kinases (PKs) have emerged as the largest family of signaling proteins in eukaryotic cells and are involved in every aspect of cellular regulation. Great progresses have been made in understanding the mechanisms of PKs phosphorylating their substrates, but the detailed mechanisms, by which PKs ensure their substrate specificity with their structurally conserved catalytic domains, still have not been adequately understood. Correlated mutation analysis based on large sets of diverse sequence data may provide new insights into this question.Statistical coupling, residue correlation and mutual information analyses along with clustering were applied to analyze the structure-based multiple sequence alignment of the catalytic domains of the Ser/Thr PK family. Two clusters of highly coupled sites were identified. Mapping these positions onto the 3D structure of PK catalytic domain showed that these two groups of positions form two physically close networks. We named these two networks as theta-shaped and gamma-shaped networks, respectively.The theta-shaped network links the active site cleft and the substrate binding regions, and might participate in PKs recognizing and interacting with their substrates. The gamma-shaped network is mainly situated in one side of substrate binding regions, linking the activation loop and the substrate binding regions. It might play a role in supporting the activation loop and substrate binding regions before catalysis, and participate in product releasing after phosphoryl transfer. Our results exhibit significant correlations with experimental observations, and can be used as a guide to further experimental and theoretical studies on the mechanisms of PKs interacting with their substrates.",

        "abstract": "A new technique for studying starch gelatinization under shear stress using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) with shear sandwich mode is reported. Rice starch was used as the model material in the experimental work. The physical meaning of storage modulus G ′ , loss modulus G ′′ and tangent of the phase angle tan δ , measured during starch gelatinization, is discussed. The effects of various factors, such as sample preparation and measurement conditions, on the measured results are discussed. A sharp peak of tan δ was detected during heating starch, which well represents the starch gelatinization process under shear stress. Comparison between the results detected by DMA and differential scanning calorimetry was used to interpret the processes and mechanisms of starch gelatinization. Results showed that variations in physical properties occurred both before thermal transition started and after thermal transition was complete. DMA has proved to be a convenient technique to study starch gelatinization under shear stress. One of the important advantages of this technique is it can be used to study starch gelatinization at low moisture contents (⩽50%) under shear stress. Keywords Gelatinization Shear Starch Rice DMA",

        "abstract": "Neuronal calcium sensors (NCS) are important constituents in the intracellular signaling pathways. A novel human gene, NCS-1, was identified in the present study. Among the 16 human tissues examined, NCS-1 is expressed most abundantly in the brain. Among the brain regions, the expression level of NCS-1 in cerebral cortex is the highest, which is about six times higher than the average level of the whole brain and a hundred times higher than the spinal cord. In the 12 different anatomical regions of human brain, the expression level of NCS-1 is very high in the temporal lobe, occipital pole, frontal lobe, thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus; moderate in cerebellum, putamen, caudate nucleus; low in the medulla, substantia nigra and the lowest in corpus callosum. Our results suggest that NCS-1 in human brain might be involved in a variety of brain functions such as sensory processing, motor control, emotional control, learning and memory.",

        "abstract": "The aim of our study was to determine the impact of genetic polymorphisms in the caspase (CASP) genes on prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We genotyped 7 potentially functional polymorphisms in CASP3, CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, CASP10 genes in 362 HCC patients of receiving surgical resection of HCC tumor. The associations of genotype and haplotype with overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were analyzed by using the Cox proportional hazards model. We found that the CASP9 rs4645981 C allele was significantly associated with positive effect on DFS (P = 0.011 and 0.016 for CT+CC vs. TT in univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively), CT genotype was associated with a better OS of HCC than the TT genotype both in univariate and multivariate analysis (P = 0.048 and 0.041, respectively). Moreover, the CASP3 rs2705897 GT genotype showed marginally significant association with decreased OS and DFS, compared with the GG genotype. One haplotype TT/TG in CASP3 (constructed by rs12108497 T>C and rs2705897 T>G) was significantly associated with decreased OS and DFS, compared to the common haplotype TT/TT both in univariate analysis (P = 0.021 and 0.026, respectively) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.025 and 0.030, respectively). The haplotype GT/GT in CASP9 (constructed by rs4645978 A>G and rs4645981 C>T) was significantly associated with decreased DFS both in univariate and multivariate analysis (P = 0.012 and 0.010, respectively). In conclusion, the CASP9 rs4645981 polymorphism, CASP3 and CASP9 haplotypes may be useful prognosis markers for HCC patients with surgical resection of tumor.",

The ZNF449 cDNA consists of 4035 nucleotides and has a 518-amino acids open reading frame. The predicted protein contains a leucine-rich\n region (LER or SCAN domain) at the N-terminus. At the C-terminus of the protein, there are 7 C2H2 (Cys2–His2) zinc-finger motifs. The expression pattern of ZNF449 showed that it was ubiquitously expressed in 18 human adult tissues.

However, this increase in usage has also created many challenges associated with disposal and their impact on the environment. This is because polyolefins do not easily degrade in the natural environment and hence the need for degradable polyolefins has become a major topic of research. Degradable polyolefins are designed to retain functionality as a commodity plastic for the required service life but degrade to non-toxic end products in a disposal environment. They are typically designed to oxo-degrade while undergoing changes in chemical structure as a result of oxidation in air, thus causing the breakdown of the molecules into small fragments that are then bioassimilated. This article presents (i) a comprehensive review of the chemistry of additives for the degradation of polyolefins, (ii) a patent and scientific literature summary of technologies including commercially available systems, (iii) the mechanisms of degradation and biodegradation, (iv) testing methods and (v) toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Cyclophilin A acts as protein folding chaperones and intracellular transports in many cellular processes. Previous studies have shown that cyclophilin A can interact with HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) gag protein and enhance viral infectivity. Many cyclophilin A inhibitors such as cyclosporin A can inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro. Here, we report a structure-based identification of novel non-peptidic cyclophilin A inhibitors as anti-HIV lead compounds. Following a computer-aided virtual screening and subsequent surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, 12 low molecular weight cyclophilin A ligands were selected for further evaluation of their in vitro inhibition of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity of cyclophilin A and HIV-1 replication. Five of these compounds (FD5, FD8, FD9, FD10 and FD12) exhibited inhibition against both PPIase activity and HIV-1 infection. These active compounds will be used as leads for structure and activity relationship (SAR) and optimization studies in order to design more effective anti-HIV-1 therapeutics, and as probes for investigating the effect of cyclophilins on HIV-1 replication.",

Characterization of novel pathways that act in parallel with the VEGF/VEGFR axis to promote tumor angiogenesis may provide insights into novel anti-angiogenic therapeutic targets. We found that the expression level of Nogo-B is positively correlated with tumor vessel density in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While Nogo-B depletion inhibited tumor angiogenesis, Nogo-B overexpression promoted tumor angiogenesis in a tumor xenograft subcutaneous model of the human HCC cell line. Mechanically, Nogo-B regulates tumor angiogenesis based on its association with integrin α β , and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Moreover, Nogo-B antibody successfully abolished the function of Nogo-B in tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that Nogo-B is an important tumor angiogenic factor and blocking Nogo-B selectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis. This article is protected by copyright.

Aurora-B is an important serine/threonine kinase required for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Identification of Aurora-B substrates will help to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of mitosis. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found a novel partner of Aurora-B, Septin1, belonging to a conserved family of GTPase proteins that localize to the cleavage furrow and are involved in cytokinesis. We confirmed this interaction using Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells and GST-pull-down analysis in vitro. Moreover, Aurora-B can phosphorylate Septin1 in vitro. We identified that Ser248, Ser307, and Ser315 are the main phosphorylation sites in Septin1. These two proteins partially co-localize to the midbody during cytokinesis. So, it is possible that Septin1's role in the regulation of cytokinesis is related to its phosphorylation by Aurora-B. Unlike previous reports that Septins function in cytokinesis and localize to the cleavage furrow, we found that Septin1 localizes to the spindle pole throughout mitosis, indicating that Septin1 may function in chromosome segregation as well.",

        "abstract": "How to further sweep residual oil from unswept areas is crucial to enhance oil recovery after polymer flooding, which is widely used. Branched-preformed particle gel (B-PPG) is a newly developed chemical agent for enhanced oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs. In this paper, B-PPG/HPAM/surfactant mixed solutions were investigated to further enhance oil recovery after polymer flooding in parallel-sandpack models by core flood test. First of all, laboratory experiments about fractional flow and enhanced oil recovery were performed to determine the optimal composition and concentration of B-PPG and HPAM mixed solutions. The results show that B-PPG/HPAM mixed solutions have higher abilities to adjust fractional flow in parallel-sandpack models than HPAM alone when the mass percentage of B-PPG is larger than 50%. Moreover, B-PPG/HPAM mixed solutions can displace more oil in low permeability sandpacks and the total oil recovery is the highest when the mass percentage of B-PPG is 50%. The concentration also has a great effect on fractional flow and oil recovery of B-PPG/HPAM mixed solutions. The ability of adjusting fractional flow and enhancing oil recovery increases with increase in concentration. Furthermore, the presence of surfactant in the flooding solutions can further enhance total oil recovery, especially that in high permeability sandpacks, and has no obvious effect on the ability to adjust fractional flow. When the permeability ratio of the parallel sandpacks becomes 1 : 9, the B-PPG/HPAM/surfactant mixed solutions still have strong abilities to adjust fractional flow and enhance the oil recovery. This is because the presence of a surfactant can improve displacement efficiency, while B-PPG and HPAM can enhance sweep efficiency.",

The granule appearance, the crystal structure and the digestion rate in the upper gastrointestinal tract of kneaded starches were investigated by using the technique of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction and In-Vitro enzymatic digestion test. The results indicate that the surface of the sample granule becomes rougher as the digestion resistance ability decreased, and that the crystal structure changes from B-type to V-type, and that the degradability of kneaded starch carrier materials is increased indicating the different enzyme-responsive of kneaded starch carriers. Furthermore, Starch-based matrix tablets for macromolecular drugs were designed using pancreatic enzyme as drug model. The pancreatic enzyme release in simulated gastric fluid and in simulated intestinal fluid from matrix tablets was investigated. It is found that the kneaded starches with different digestion resistivity can be used as drug carriers for different gastrointestinal tract target drug delivery.",

It was shown that overexpressed CUTA isoform2 sensitized HeLa cells to copper toxicity by promoting copper-induced apoptosis.

        "abstract": "PIDD1 (P53-induced death domain) is a pro-apoptotic gene which can be induced by p53. So far, three alternative splicing products of human PIDD gene have been identified. Here we report a new splicing variant of this gene and named it PIDD4. The coding sequence of PIDD4 contains intron 3 and a 60 bp insert at the 5' of exon 3. Each insertion has an in-frame stop codon, which makes PIDD4 get translated from exon 5 then. Therefore, PIDD4 protein lacks the 32 KD N-terminal peptide, missing the LRR domain found in the other three isoforms. In this study, we have shown that the expression of PIDD4 is also regulated by p53, and as PIDD2, it is not expressed in heart either. Moreover, PIDD4 is the only isoform which is expressed in skeletal muscle. This isoform mainly localizes in the cytoplasm, and produces a relatively higher proportion of PIDD-CC fragment. Overexpression of PIDD4 independently promotes apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of serine/threonine kinases, playing an essential role in regulating cell-cycle\n progression. In our present work, human CDK5 and a novel CDK5 splicing variant, named as CDK5-SV, were cloned from the cDNA library of human testis. CDK5-SV lacking the exon 7 of CDK5 encodes a protein of 260 amino acids. Through RT-PCR analysis in different human tissues, CDK5-SV was found to be expressed in testis, skeletal muscle, colon, bone marrow and ovary, while CDK5 was ubiquitously expressed. Immunofluorescence experiment in HeLa cells showed that the subcellular localizations of CDK5-SV\n and CDK5 were totally different. CDK5 mainly located in the cytoplasm, while CDK5-SV accumulated in nucleus. Reporter gene\n assay showed that when co-transfected with β-catenin, CDK5 and CDK5-SV could both strongly inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Consistently, CDK5-SV could also interact with β-catenin\n as CDK5 does. Taken together, our findings suggest that CDK5-SV might also be a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling\n pathway.",

The films were based on a high-amylose corn starch that was chemically modified in different ways. Hydroxypropylation was used to decrease gelatinization temperature and improve processability. The reinforcing component consisted of cross-linked starch granules, where the crosslinking increased granule thermal stability and moisture resistance. Distribution of the cross-linked starch was imaged by CLSM, and the matrix/particle interface was studied by SEM. Modulus and tensile properties of the starch film were increased by about 30 and 20%, respectively, after addition of rigid cross-linked starch particles. A perfect interface between matrix and reinforce agent was obtained. Biodegradable starch-based self-reinforced composites were designed and prepared using a high-amylose corn starch. Modulus and tensile properties of the film increased by 30% after addition of 20 wt.-% rigid cross-linked starch particles with no significant loss in failure strain. CLSM demonstrates a homogeneous distribution of the particles in the matrix. There is no observable change of both particle size and brightness for the cross-linked starch, after distribution in the suspension of hydroxypropylated starch. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "title": "Rheological properties of starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios",
        "abstract": "The rheological properties of corn starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios (80/20, 50/50, 23/77, and 0/100) were systematically studied by Haake rheometry. The starches were initially pre-compounded with water to designated moisture content levels using a twin-screw extruder. A single-screw extruder with a slit capillary die was then used to characterize the shear stress and melt viscosity characteristics of sample pellets, as a function of both moisture content (19–27%) and extrusion temperature (110–140 °C). The melts exhibited shear thinning behavior under all conditions, with the power law index (0 < n < 1) increasing with increasing temperature and moisture content in the majority of cases. The higher the amylose content, the higher is the viscosity (for example, η increases from 277 Pa s to 1254 Pa s when amylose content increases from 0% to 80% under a certain condition), which is opposite to the sequence of molecular weight; amylopectin-rich starches exhibited increased Newtonian behavior. These rheological behaviors are attributed to the higher gelatinization temperature of amylose-rich starches, and in particular the multiphase transitions that occur in these starches at higher temperatures, and the gel-ball structure of gelatinized amylopectin. Keywords Starch Rheometry Rheological Amylose/amylopectin Extrusion 1 Introduction Extrusion cooking has been practiced for more than 50 years, with early developments focused on the preparation of ready-to-eat cereals ( Harper, 1989 ). Some researchers have investigated the effects of amylose content in starch or dough on the physical and functional properties of their extruded products ( Guha et al., 2003; Matthey and Hanna, 1997 ). Others have analyzed viscoelastic characterization of different biopolymers and their mixtures with additives ( Bhattacharya and Padmanabhan, 1992; Bhattacharya et al., 1988; Seethamaju and Bhattacharya, 1994 ). More recently, Chanvrier et al. (2007) investigated the effects of starch and protein on the rheological properties of wheat flour dough during processing at low hydration. Different viscosity models have been proposed to describe the rheological properties of dough based on the traditional power law function. For example, Jao et al. (1978) derived a regression model for the die viscosity of soy dough by considering the effects of temperature, shear rate and moisture content; Bhattacharya and Hanna (1986, 1987) and Harper (1981) presented examples of viscosity models applied to cooked dough; and Tomás et al. (1997) derived a regression viscosity model for extruding rice flour using a stepwise model starting from a power law equation. Due to environmental considerations and the shortage of oil, starches are now attracting increased attention as raw materials in the production of biodegradable plastics ( Arvanitoyannis, 1999; Signori et al., 2005; Söderqvist Lindblad et al., 2005 ). In addition, the water requirements during the thermal processing of these materials are normally lower than for conventional additives. There are many reported investigations of the effects of starch type or amylose/amylopectin ratio on the final properties of starch-based materials, including: • Foams ( Babin et al., 2007; Chinnaswamy and Hanna, 1988; Della Valle et al., 1997; Fang and Hanna, 2001a,b; Guan et al., 2005; Suknark et al., 1997 ). • Sheets or films ( Fishman et al., 2006; Yu and Christie, 2005; Yu et al., 2006 ). • Lightweight concrete ( Glenn et al., 1999 ). • Injection-molded products ( Funke et al., 1998; de Graaf et al., 2003 ). The melt rheology of starch-based materials has both scientific and industrial importance, and thus it has been widely investigated. For example, Llo et al. (1996) studied the effects of extrusion conditions on the apparent viscosity of maize grits, including the effects of melt temperature, shear rate, material composition, and extrusion processing history. Willett et al. (1997) reported that waxy corn starch exhibited shear thinning behavior, becoming more Newtonian as either temperature or moisture content was increased. González et al. (2006) investigated the effects of several factors including screw speed, die restriction ( l / r ) and moisture content, together with corn endosperm hardness and rice amylose content, on apparent melt viscosity using a Brabender single-screw extruder. Recently, Thuwall et al. (2006) studied the effects of amylose content, moisture content and starch/glycerol ratio on the apparent viscosity of potato starch. The effects of amylose content on reactive extrusion have also been studied ( Wing and Willett, 1997 ). Corn starches have attracted particular scientific interests, because different amylose/amylopectin content materials can be obtained from natural, renewable resources, and they exhibit multiphase transitions during thermal processing ( Chen et al., 2006, 2007; Liu et al., 2006 ). Previous studies have shown that higher amylose-content starches exhibit superior strength and toughness in the preparation of starch-based materials and in producing modified starches by reactive extrusion ( Cha et al., 2001; Dean et al., 2007; Guan and Hanna, 2004; Guan and Hanna, 2006; Miladinov and Hanna, 2000, 2001; Nabar et al., 2006; van Soest and Borger, 1997; Yu and Christie, 2005; Yu et al., 2006; Zhou and Hanna, 2004 ). However the extrusion of high-amylose starches is more difficult than that of normal starches, partly due to the higher die pressure and torque requirements due to the higher melting temperature and viscosity of these starches ( Liu et al., 2006; Shogren, 1992; Shogren and Jasberg, 1994 ). In this work, the rheological properties of corn starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios (80/20, 50/50, 23/77 and 0/100) were systematically studied as functions of moisture content and extrusion temperature using a Haake rheometer. The effects of different amylose/amylopectin ratios on the rheological behaviors will be discussed based on their microstructures and gelatinization behaviors. 2 Experimental work 2.1 Materials Four commercially available corn starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios were used in this experimental work: • Gelose 80 (G80, 80/20), supplied by Penford (Australia). • Gelose 50 (G50, 50/50), supplied by Penford (Australia). • A normal corn starch (NC, 23/77), supplied by Huanglong Food Industry Co. Ltd (P.R. China). • A waxy corn starch (WC, 0/100), supplied by Shanxi Jinli Industry Group Co. Ltd (P.R. China). An infra-red heating balance (Model DHS-20) was used to measure the moisture contents of the original starches during heating to 110 °C for 20 min. All formulations were prepared on a dry weight basis. 2.2 Sample preparation Starches were firstly premixed with water to achieve designated moisture contents. A Haake parallel, co-rotating twin-screw extruder (Rheomex PTW 24/40p, Ø 30) with a rod die (nozzle L / D = 3, diameter = 3 mm) was used to produce gelatinized starch pellets at a screw speed of 90 rpm. The extruder heating barrel comprises 10 sections. The highest temperature used during compounding was 160 °C, and the die temperature was kept at 105 °C to avoid foaming. A gravimetric feeder was used to deliver the materials into the extruder. The moisture contents in the compounded pellets were measured after heating the samples overnight at 130 °C in a vacuum oven. 2.3 Rheological measurements Compounded pellets were used to study the rheological properties of various samples. A Haake Rheocord Polylab RC500p incorporating a single-screw extruder (Rheomex 252p, Ø 19, screw 2:1, L / D 25) with a slit capillary die (20 × 1 mm) was used to measure the shear stress and apparent viscosity of samples under different shear rates at specific temperatures. The screw speed was varied between 30 and 180 min −1 , and normally six points were recorded for each sample using the cutting and manual entry measurement mode. Apparent shear rates were calculated by: (1) γ = 6 Q W H 2 where γ is the shear rate, Q is the volumetric flow rate (in cm 3 /s), W is the slit width, and H is the slit height. Shear stress values were calculated using the following equation: (2) τ = H · Δ P 2 L in which τ is the shear stress, Δ P is the pressure drop over the capillary, and L is the slit length. 2.4 Differential scanning calorimetry A Perkin–Elmer Diamond-I differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) with an internal coolant (Intercooler 1P), nitrogen purge gas, and stainless steel sample pans, was used to study the thermal properties of samples with high moisture content over a high temperature range (up to 350 °C). The melting point and enthalpy of indium were used for temperature and heat capacity calibrations, respectively. The detailed methodology and a discussion of some critical issues are presented elsewhere ( Liu et al., 2006; Yu and Christie, 2001 ). 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Effects of moisture content Fig. 1 shows the results for shear stress and melt viscosity as a function of shear rate for the various corn starches (G80, G50, NC, and WC) with different moisture contents at an extrusion temperature of 130 °C. It can be seen that, for all moisture contents, the apparent viscosity decreased with increasing shear rate, and that, in general, it also decreased with increasing moisture content in the range studied (19–27%). Similar patterns have been observed at different extrusion temperatures. A strong power law dependence of apparent viscosity on shear rate was observed for all the starch samples and measurement conditions studied, and this dependence was linear on double-logarithmic plots, indicating that the power law model of Bird et al. (1960) could be used to describe the rheological behaviors of starch-based materials: (3) η = K γ n − 1 where η is the melt viscosity, K is the consistency, γ is the shear rate, and n is the pseudoplastic index. The corresponding consistency and pseudoplastic index can be determined individually from the intercept and the slope of each single straight line in the double-log plots. For starch-based materials in this study, values of n are between 0 and 1, and when n < 1, the apparent viscosity will decrease with increasing shear rate and the materials will undergo shear thinning ( Tanner, 2000 ). 3.2 Effects of extrusion temperature Fig. 2 shows the effect of temperature on the rheological properties of the different starches at 23% moisture content, as a function of shear rate. It can be seen that the apparent viscosity generally decreased with increasing temperature from 110 to 140 °C. A strong power law dependence of apparent viscosity on shear rate is observed. For all the starch samples and measurement conditions studied, the dependence of apparent viscosity on the shear rate was linear on double-logarithmic plots, again indicating that the power law model could describe the rheological behaviors of the molten starches. 3.3 Effects of amylose content Fig. 3 shows the effect of amylose content on the shear stress and melt viscosity of various samples at a moisture content of 23% and extrusion temperature of 130 °C, as a function of shear rate. It was found that higher amylose content resulted in a higher apparent viscosity over the same shear rate range. For example, at a shear rate of 100 S −1 , η is 277, 635, 1008, and 1254 Pa s for WC, NC, G50, and G80 respectively under the condition of 23% moisture content and 130 °C extrusion temperature. 3.4 Power law parameters Table 1 lists the detailed parameters of regression power law for the different samples and extrusion conditions investigated. It can be seen that, in most cases, n was higher when the moisture content was higher, which is to be expected, since increased water content in starches could make them more Newtonian. This corresponds with most previous studies ( Della Valle et al., 1996a; González et al., 2006; Kokini et al., 1992; Lai and Kokini, 1990 ), although Willett et al. (1997) reported that the effect of moisture on n was not clear in their study of waxy corn starch. The results in this experimental work show that there are only a few conditions (e.g. at 140 °C) that produce abnormal effects of moisture content on the power law index n . One explanation could relate to the slight expansion at the higher temperature and the enhancement of moisture evaporation during measurement. Variations of volume or mass at higher temperatures will affect the shear rate, which will in turn affect the exponent n (see Eqs. (1) and (3) ). Increasing temperature will increase the power law index n and thus make the starch melt less pseudoplastic and more Newtonian. Similar results have been reported for both waxy corn starch ( Della Valle et al., 1996b; Willett et al., 1997 ) and normal corn starch ( Willett et al., 1994, 1995 ). An increase in n with increasing temperature has also been observed with waxy corn starch during first-pass twin-screw extrusion ( Della Valle et al., 1996b; Lai and Kokini, 1990 ). It is important to note that n became higher with decreasing amylose content for the studied corn starches, clearly indicating that lower amylose-content corn starch has a more Newtonian behavior in its melting state. Similar results have been observed in previous studies ( Della Valle et al., 1996b; Lai and Kokini, 1990 ). The decrease in the power law index with increasing amylose content was generally attributed to an increase in entanglements between amylose chains, since the highly branched amylopectin was not expected to form effective entanglements ( Willett et al., 1997; Yu and Christie, 2005 ). Table 1 also shows that the power law consistency value K decreased with increasing moisture content and extrusion temperature. Since the K value has a direct relationship with viscosity (see Eq. (3) ), it can be used to represent the viscosity characteristics of a material under certain conditions. The K results are as expected, since both water (as plasticizer) and temperature will normally decrease the viscosity of a polymeric material. By plotting the effects of amylose content and temperature on K (figure not shown here), it can be seen that higher amylose content resulted in a higher K value. For example, K increased from 10 3 for WC to 10 5 for G80 at the highest temperature investigated (140 °C). However, all starches recorded a lower K value with increasing temperature, although the decrease in K was not linear for starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios. It should be pointed out that there were a few anomalies for the waxy starch at higher temperature, which could be explained by the expansion of the material during extrusion, as discussed earlier. Gelatinization during thermal processing is one of the unique characteristics of starch-based materials, and Fig. 4 shows the gelatinization endotherms of the various starches as measured by DSC. It can be seen that for the waxy and normal corn starches, a large gelatinization endotherm, G, appeared at about 70 °C. A second endotherm, M2, was detected for NC at about 90 °C, which was considered to be a phase transition within an amylose–lipid complex ( Biliaderis et al., 1985; Jovanovich and Añón, 1999; Liu et al., 2006; Raphaelides and Karkalas, 1988 ). A very broad endotherm was observed in the temperature range of 65–115 °C for both high amylose-content starches (G50 and G80), which represents a composite of gelatinization endotherm G and a phase transition within the amylose–lipid complex M2. For G80, a small endotherm, M, was also detected at about 155 °C, which was considered to be amylose melting ( Liu et al., 2006 ). The higher temperature detected for the amylose-rich starches can be used to explain their higher viscosity and less Newtonian behavior. It is has been noticed that the higher the amylose content, the higher the viscosity, which is opposite to the sequence of molecular weight (see Fig. 3 ) ( Liu et al., 2006 ). The unique microstructure and phase transition can be used to explain this phenomenon. Fig. 5 shows a schematic representation of the microstructure and phase transition of starch during gelatinization, in which the double helical, crystalline structure formed by the short branched chains in amylopectin are torn apart. However, these short branched chains remain in a regular pattern by retaining a certain “memory”. French (1984) reported that the thickness of crystalline lamellae in native amylopectin and recrystallized amylopectin is the same (about 50 Å), which supports the “memory” theory. In a previous study, Yu and Christie (2005) indicated that these short branched chains form gel-balls that are comprised mainly of chains from the same sub-main chain. In addition, one amylopectin molecule may form a relatively separate super-globe. The molecular entanglements between gel-balls and super-globes are much less than those between linear polymer chains, due to their size and the length of the chains (only 4–6 glucose). These gel-balls require less energy to move than long linear chains, especially when they are lubricated by a plasticizer (water). Because of the highly branched microstructure of starch, and the formation of gel-balls and super-globes after gelatinization, the entanglement of polymer chains in amylopectin-rich starch is much less than that in amylose-rich linear starch. This could explain why amylopectin-rich materials initially have lower modulus and higher elongation, and lower viscosity during extrusion ( Yu and Christie, 2005 ). It could also explain why amylopectin-rich starches exhibit increased Newtonian behavior. 4 Conclusions In this work, the rheological properties of various corn starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios (0/100, 23/77, 50/50, and 80/20) were firstly systematically studied using a Haake rheometer. A single-screw extruder with a slit capillary die was used to characterize shear stress and apparent melt viscosity as functions of moisture content (19–27 °C) and extrusion temperature (110–140 °C). The melts exhibited shear thinning behavior under all conditions, with the power law index n (0 < n < 1) increasing with increasing temperature and moisture content in most cases; and it decreased as amylose content increased. The K value decreased with increasing moisture content and extrusion temperature; and it increased with increasing amylose content (for example, K increased from 10 3 for WC to 10 5 for G80 at 140 °C). The amylose-rich corn starches showed higher viscosity and less Newtonian behavior, which can be explained by its higher gelatinization temperature (and in particular multiphase transition at higher temperature), greater molecular entanglements between linear polymer chains, and less gel-balls and super-globes that are much easier to move than long linear chains. The results of this work have confirmed some previously reported results, and have addressed some earlier confusion.

DnaJ/Hsp40 proteins act as co-chaperones by binding to the chaperone Hsp70 through their J domain and stimulating ATP hydrolysis to aid protein translation, folding, unfolding, translocation and degradation. They are implicated in various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In the present study, we cloned and identified a new gene, DnaJ (HSP40) homolog, subfamily C, member 25 (DNAJC25), which is localized to the cytoplasm. Real-time PCR revealed that the expression of DNAJC25 is particularly high in the liver and is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with adjacent normal tissues. The overexpression of DNAJC25 led to an inhibition of colony growth both in quantity and size. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that DNAJC25 also significantly increased cell apoptosis. Our data, therefore, indicate that DNAJC25 plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis, and should be further studied as a potential tumor suppressor candidate.",

        "abstract": "To clinically characterize 116 Chinese patients with primary congenital glaucoma and to determine the role of CYP1B1 and MYOC mutations in this cohort.This study included 116 unrelated patients with primary congenital glaucoma and 120 ethnically matched, unrelated, healthy controls in China. CYP1B1 and MYOC were amplified from genomic DNA, followed by direct DNA sequencing to identify disease-causing variants.Twenty patients (17.2%) had CYP1B1 mutations. Five of these patients had homozygous mutant alleles and 4 had compound heterozygous mutations. Fourteen of the mutations were novel. Three patients (2.6%) had MYOC mutations, all of which were novel.This study describes the spectrum of CYP1B1 and MYOC mutations in a large cohort of Chinese patients with primary congenital glaucoma. The role of mutations in CYP1B1 and MYOC varies, depending on the ethnic origin of the patients. Clinical Relevance Patients with primary congenital glaucoma and CYP1B1 mutations tend to have a more severe phenotype than those without mutations. Genetic testing of CYP1B1 mutations may help predict new cases and their prognoses.",

        "abstract": "Maintenance of different organelles in eukaryotic cells depends on sorting proteins, which ensure the proper delivery of organelle-specific proteins. The studies on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) VPS35, a hydrophilic membrane protein having a direct role in the retrieval of cargo proteins, suggest a mechanism underlying a possible lysosomal protein-sorting pathway in mammalian cells. Here, we report the isolation of human and mouse VPS35 cDNAs, which are 3208 and 3186 bp in length, respectively. The deduced proteins of the two cDNAs, which are both composed of 796 amino acids and share 99% identity, show homology to yeast VPS35 and other VPS35 homologues of various sources ranging from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to Drosophila melanogaster (31-56% identity and 49-71% similarity), especially in their amino- and carboxyl-termini. The conservation of VPS35 suggests that the function of this class of protein is important. The results of Northern hybridization of human VPS35 in 16 tissues showed that one transcript of 3.6 kb was highly expressed in brain, heart, testis, ovary, small intestine, spleen, skeletal muscle, and placenta and expressed at moderate or low levels in other tissues. Another transcript of 3.0 kb was also expressed with proportionally lower levels than the 3.6-kb transcript in all the tissues except that the 3.0-kb transcript was not detected in brain. Mouse Vps35 was widely expressed as a 3.4-kb transcript. In addition, human VPS35 was assigned to human chromosome 16q13-q21 by radiation hybrid mapping.",
