Trichothecene-type determination by a multiplex PCR-test indicated that all isolates were either of a nivalenol\n (NIV) or a 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol (3ADON) type. The 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol (15ADON) type was not detected in this collection.\n Based on a Bayesian model-based clustering method using allele data obtained with 11 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR)\n markers, we detected three genetic clusters. The majority of isolates in the clusters were NIV isolates from both Japan and\n China, Japanese 3ADON and Chinese 3ADON isolates, respectively. High levels of fixation indices and low levels of effective\n number of migrants were observed between the genetic clusters. Data was re-analyzed by classifying the isolates into six groups\n according to trichothecene type and geographic location. Population analyses of these re-classified groups indicated that\n the genetic subdivisions of F. asiaticum were correlated with both trichothecene type and geographic differences.",

        "abstract": "Lodging is one possible risk factor that leads to increased cereal mycotoxin contamination, but few reports have been published\n on the subject. We examined the effects of lodging on the level of deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV) contamination\n in wheat, barley, and rice infected with the Fusarium graminearum species complex. Case-control and intervention studies were applied to test the hypothesis that lodging increases the level of mycotoxin contamination.\n A total of 66 grain samples were collected from each field in 12 Japanese prefectures from 2002 to 2006. Each sample set consisted\n of grains from lodged and nonlodged plants. The concentration of DON\u00a0+\u00a0NIV in lodged plants was significantly higher than\n in nonlodged plants. All samples of wheat and barley were contaminated with DON and NIV; however, most of the lodged rice\n samples were contaminated only with NIV. In intervention trials to investigate the effects of lodging duration, a small area\n of wheat inoculated with the pathogen was completely lodged by trampling. Even with 5\u00a0days of lodging, the levels of DON\u00a0+\u00a0NIV\n in wheat grain at harvest increased by 27\u201351% compared to nonlodged control plots. For rice, half of each plot area was completely\n lodged by trampling 20\u00a0days before harvest. The level of NIV in lodged rice grain was significantly higher than that in nonlodged\n rice at optimum and delayed harvests, because lodging significantly increased the level of Fusarium mycotoxins in the three crops. Thus, practices (e.g., rational use of fertilizers) to avoid lodging should reduce the risk\n of mycotoxin contamination. This is the first epidemiological study on the effect of lodging on mycotoxin production by the\n F. graminearum species complex in wheat, barley, and rice.",

Four cultivars were tested in a greenhouse environment, where the plants were spray inoculated at three different stages with a mixture of DON and NIV chemotypes of F. graminearum. The results indicate that high levels of DON and NIV can be produced beyond 20 days after anthesis (DAA), even by early infection. The results of field experiments performed on seven cultivars, where inoculation was conducted using colonized maize kernel inoculum, were consistent with the greenhouse results. In addition, in the greenhouse experiments, late infection, at least as late as 20 DAA, caused grain contamination with these toxins even without clear disease symptoms on the spike. These results indicate the importance of the late stage in grain development in DON and NIV contamination, suggesting that control strategies that cover the late as well as the early stage of grain development should be established to effectively reduce the risk of these toxins' contaminating wheat.",

        "abstract": "The occurrence of mycotoxins in small grain cereals and their retention in final products are serious concerns for food safety.\n Previously, we investigated the fate of deoxynivalenol and nivalenol in a Japanese soft red winter wheat cultivar during milling\n and we found that deoxynivalenol and/or nivalenol was readily distributed among flours for human consumption. In the present\n study, we analyzed the ergosterol concentrations in the milling fractions as an index of fungal biomass to elucidate the relationship\n between deoxynivalenol/nivalenol accumulation and fungal invasion into the grain, after the in-house validation of an analytical\n method for quantifying ergosterol in the resulting milling fractions (patent flour, low-grade flour, bran, and shorts). Using\n three samples with different levels of deoxynivalenol and/or nivalenol contamination, the contents of deoxynivalenol/nivalenol\n and ergosterol in the resulting milling fractions were evaluated. The concentration of ergosterol was always lowest in patent\n flour and highest in bran or shorts, indicating that most of the fungi is retained in the outer layers of grain (bran and\n shorts) even in highly contaminated grain. On the other hand, the concentrations of deoxynivalenol and nivalenol were similar\n in the low-grade and patent flours and only slightly lower than in the medium-level and high-level contaminated grains. Moreover,\n the percentage distribution of ergosterol was higher in bran than in other fractions in all cases, which differed from that\n of deoxynivalenol/nivalenol. This result indicates the diffusion of deoxynivalenol/nivalenol inside the grain that is independent\n of fungal invasion.",

        "abstract": "In the western part of Japan, two wheat cultivars, Nishinokaori and Minaminokaori, are currently cultivated for breadmaking.\n Breadmaking wheat requires a higher protein content compared to the Japanese noodle wheat (the major type of wheat in Japan).\n This high protein level in the grain is obtained by top-dressing with nitrogen (N) near anthesis. Because such N applications\n may increase levels of Fusarium head blight (FHB) and consequent mycotoxin [deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV)] accumulation\n in the grain, the effect of N application (0, 4, and 8\u00a0g/m2) at anthesis on FHB and mycotoxin accumulation in Nishinokaori and Minaminokaori was tested in the greenhouse in 2004 and\n 2005 and in two fields in 2006. In the greenhouse, plants were spray inoculated at 3, 10, and 20\u00a0days after N treatment. In\n field experiments, colonized maize kernels, which generate ascospores during the testing season, served as inoculum. In all\n experiments for both cultivars, N application at anthesis significantly increased grain protein as expected, but had no significant\n effect on FHB and DON and NIV levels in grain. These results suggest that, at least in these cultivars, N can be applied close\n to anthesis without increasing the risk of FHB and mycotoxin (DON and NIV) accumulation.",

We examined the effect of the timing of Fusarium graminearum infection on Fusarium head blight (FHB) and mycotoxin accumulation in barley cultivars with different flowering types using greenhouse experiments. In the first experiment, 13 cultivars were spray inoculated at two different developmental stages, and the severity of FHB was evaluated. The effect of the timing of infection differed among cultivars. Cleistogamous cultivars were resistant at anthesis but susceptible at 10 days after anthesis, whereas chasmogamous cultivars were already susceptible at anthesis. In the second experiment, five cultivars were inoculated at three different developmental stages and the concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV) in mature grain were analyzed. Cleistogamous cultivars accumulated more mycotoxins (DON and NIV) when inoculated 10 or 20 days after anthesis than when inoculated at anthesis, whereas chasmogamous cultivars accumulated more mycotoxins when inoculated at anthesis. Thus, the most critical time for F. graminearum infection and mycotoxin accumulation in barley differs with cultivar, and likely is associated with the flowering type. Late infection, even without accompanied FHB symptoms, was also significant in terms of the risk of mycotoxin contamination.",

        "abstract": "A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) immunoassay using a monoclonal antibody was developed to measure nivalenol (NIV) and deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination in wheat. A highly sensitive and stable DON-immobilized sensor chip was prepared, and an SPR detection procedure was developed. The competitive inhibition assay used a monoclonal antibody that cross-reacts with NIV and DON. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of the SPR assay were 28.8 and 14.9 ng mL(-1) for NIV and DON, respectively. The combined responses of NIV and DON in wheat were obtained using a simultaneous detection assay in a one-step cleanup procedure. NIV and DON were separated using a commercial DON-specific immunoaffinity column (IAC) and their responses were obtained using an independent detection assay. Spiked tests using these toxins revealed that recoveries were in the range 91.5-107% with good relative standard deviations (RSDs) (0.40-4.1%) and that detection limits were 0.1 and 0.05 mg kg(-1) for NIV and DON, respectively. The independent detection using IAC showed detection limits of 0.2 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) for NIV and DON, respectively. SPR analysis results were correlated with those obtained using a conventional LC/MS/MS method for wheat co-contaminated with NIV and DON. These results suggested that the developed SPR assay is a practical method to rapidly screen the NIV and DON co-contamination of wheat and one of a very few immunoassays to detect NIV directly.",

The heart showed a slight increase in the accumulation of the lipofuscin-like lipopigments in the myocardial fibers, slight to severe fibrosis and infiltration of fat cells in the myocardium. The lipopigments both in the heart and in neurons of the CNS had curvilinear profiles on electron microscope and reacted immunohistochemically to polyclonal antibodies against subunit c of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase.

The rats were killed 1, 3, 7 or 21 days after surgery, the brains were removed and the prefrontal cortices were subjected to immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis for the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In some rats, vehicle was injected into the nbM and in others 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was injected into the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Quantitative Western blot analysis revealed significantly greater immunoreactivity for GFAP in the prefrontal cortex of nbM-lesioned rats. Immunohistochemical examination revealed fibrous and hypertrophic GFAP-positive astrocytes even one day after surgery, and this reaction was stronger at 3 days after surgery. After this peak, GFAP-immunoreactivity of the astrocytes decreased from 7 days to 21 days. In contrast, GFAP-positive astrocytes were not observed in the brains of vehicle-injected or VTA-lesioned rats, even 21 days after surgery. The present results indicate that cortical astrocytes respond to cholinergic deafferentation. In addition, our findings provide new insights into the abnormalities of cortical glial cells after cholinergic deafferentation in Alzheimer's disease.",

We counted the number of ILC neurons with clearly defined nucleoli in 12 sections of each segment, each section 20 microns thick and taken at 100 microns intervals and then divided the 6 alternating segments into 3 groups, upper (Th2, 4), middle (Th6, 8) and lower (Th10, 12). In each of the three groups of normal control cases, the number of ILC neurons had decreased with aging. In all MJD cases, the number of ILC neurons had moderately decreased in comparison with age-matched controls. One of the MJD cases showed a marked decrease in the number of ILC neurons, as did the SDS case. The ILCs of the entire thoracic spinal cord in the MJD cases were moderately involved.",

        "abstract": "Molecular genetic assessments of 69 individuals in 44 families with hereditary cerebellar ataxia (HCA) were made to determine the relative frequencies of subtypes of HCA in Yamagata, Japan. Fifteen families (34%) had SCA1, none had SCA2, nine (20%) had MJD, five (11%) had SCA6 and nine (20%) had DRPLA. These findings differ markedly from those in other regions of Japan and the rest of the world. A morphometrical study of the brain MR images also was made on 38 individuals with SCA1 (n = 14), MJD (n = 8) or SCA6 (n = 16). In SCA1, the ventral pons was atrophic in proportion to the amount of cerebellar atrophy. In MJD, both the pons and the cerebellum were atrophic, cerebellar atrophy being less pronounced than that in SCA1 and SCA6. While both the major and minor axes of the ventral pons were proportionally decreased in SCA1, the minor axis was more decreased than the major axis in MJD. In SCA6, a mild reduction in the ratio of the ventral pontine area to the posterior fossa area (Pv/PF) was observed as well as obvious cerebellar atrophy. These findings indicate that in MR images SCA1, MJD and SCA6 show different atrophic features of the cerebellum and brainstem.",

        "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport, is characterized by impaired biliary excretion and by impaired incorporation of copper into cerulo-plasmin. Toxic accumulation of copper causes tissue damage, primarily in the liver, brain, and kidneys. The gene for WD (ATP7B) has been cloned, and the protein product is predicted to be a copper-transporting P-type ATPase with high amino acid identity with that for Menkes disease, an X-linked disorder of copper transport. Mutation screening in WD patients has led to the identification of at least 40 mutations. In addition, haplotype analysis using three di-nucleotide-repeat markers, D13S314, D13S301, and D13S316, has been a useful indicator of specific mutations. We have determined haplotypes for the patients and their parents and sibs, in 21 unrelated WD families from Japan. Twenty-eight different haplotypes were observed on 42 WD chromosomes. In all the patients, the ATP7B coding sequence, including the intron-exon boundaries, was screened for mutations, by SSCP, followed by direct-sequence analysis of the shifted fragments. We identified 13 mutations, of which 11 mutations are novel, including 7 mutations-1 insertion, 4 deletions, and 2 missense mutations\u2014in the coding region. The mutations reported in previous studies are 2299insC and Arg778Leu. Two patients were shown to have the 2299insC mutation, which has occurred in many different haplotypes in several populations, indicating a mutation hot spot. Primer-extension analysis of ATP7B mRNA has revealed multiple transcription start sites. Four of the novel mutations (three 1-bp changes and one 5-bp deletion) occur in the 5\u2032 UTR and may result in altered expression of the WD gene.",

        "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) can detect circulating microembolic signals (MES). We focused our attention on tail signs (TS), a signal associated with MES that appeared as a small reversal signal after MES on the high time resolution spectral display. We examined MES and artifacts in an animal study to determine whether TS were specific changes associated with MES and investigated the characteristics of TS in both animal and clinical studies. Methods\u2014In an animal study, adult pigs with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and minimal anticoagulation therapy were used as a model for cerebral embolism. After performing TCD monitoring with a multigated approach, we did an offline analysis to investigate several parameters concerning MES and TS. We also examined TS in patients in a clinical study. Results\u2014From a total of 362 MES investigated in the animal study, 72.9% were followed by TS. We could not find any TS associated with artifacts. The time delay between TS and MES was negatively correlated with the velocity of MES. MES almost always appeared first in the proximal channel, whereas TS conversely appeared first in the distal channel. In the clinical study, we were also able to observe TS associated with MES. Conclusions\u2014TS may represent emboli passing down a branch vessel or twisted downstream vessel. TS are specific for MES and can be used as another criterion for MES identification.

We previously reported that a partial blood replacement with Fluosol DA reduced ischemic neuronal injury. The purpose of this study is to elucidate whether pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate solution (PHP) exerts neuro-projective effects against cerebral ischemia.38 adult male gerbils were divided into 4 groups, such as normal group without ischemia or treatment, PHP group undergoing an exchanging blood transfusion with 5.0 ml PHP, ischemia group undergoing 5-min forebrain ischemia, and PHP-ischemia group with 5.0 ml PHP partial blood replacement prior to 5-min forebrain ischemia. Cerebral injury was assessed 7 days after treatment. In another group, effects of PHP on blood nitric oxide (NO) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were studied.CA1 cell density was 140-2/mm in normal group and 142-5/mm in PHP group. The cell density was markedly reduced to 38-13 in ischemia group. The cell density was further reduced 27-10/mm in PHP-ischemia group. PHP was found to have a potent NO scavenger action and reduce CBF.Partial blood replacement with PHP prior to ischemia may cause cerebral vasoconstriction due to NO scavenger action and may worsen ischemic injury.",

        "abstract": "Seven patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy associated with cerebellar atrophy (HMSNCA) are presented. This is the first comprehensive evaluation of what is a unique disorder, half way between the cerebellar atrophies and the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies. In addition to cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, the most frequent features in HMSNCA were nystagmus, dysarthria, mental impairment and tremor. Pyramidal signs or autonomic nerve dysfunction was never revealed. Scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis was not noted. Progression of the disorder was very slow, most of the patients being ambulatory more than 10 years after the onset. Most of the patients had hypoalbuminemia. Half-life periods of serum albumin were normal and decreased synthesis of albumin in the liver was suspected. An autosomal recessive inheritance was strongly suggested, because of healthy consanguineous parents and affected siblings in these families. The segregation ratio was 0.32 +/- 0.10 and was close to the expected ratio of 0.25 in an autosomal recessive inheritance.",

        "abstract": "The functional organization of the human cerebellum involved in saccadic eye movements was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).The subjects were 7 normal volunteers aged 18-34 years. Visual stimuli were back-projected onto a screen placed at the subjects' feet. The stimulation period of 30 s consisted of a saccade target jumping back and forth horizontally by 20 degrees once per second. The control period of 30 s consisted of a fixed target. The stimulation and control periods were alternated 10 times during the presentation. Functional images were collected with a 1.5-tesla clinical MRI scanner. The significance of activation was determined by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 99) at a threshold of p < 0.001 (uncorrected), and significantly activated areas were superimposed on the T(1)-weighted images.Significantly activated areas related to visually guided saccades were observed in the cerebellar vermis (declive and folium), in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres (mainly the superior semilunar lobule) of the cerebellum, in the frontal eye field, in the supplementary eye field and in parts of the parietal lobule of the cerebrum.Our results suggest that the cerebellar posterior vermis and bilateral hemispheres are related to saccades in humans. These results are consistent with neurophysiological data obtained in primates.",

The patient had mild symptoms despite severe visual field loss. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging using two kinds of visual stimulation to assess her residual visual function. The functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the activity in her association visual cortex was largely intact bilaterally, although the activation of the calcarine cortex was decreased in the left calcarine cortex. Her activity in the visual cortex seemed to correspond well to her visual symptom. Functional magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in objectively documenting residual visual function in patients with severe visual loss.",

As controls, six normal subjects were also tested in the same manner.In the patients with optic neuritis, the changes in the hemoglobin concentrations (oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin) in the occipital lobe were found to be markedly reduced when the clinically affected eyes were stimulated compared with the fellow eyes. The response induced by the stimulation of the affected eye was decreased, even when the patient's visual acuity improved to 20/20 in the recovery phase. There was no difference in the concentration changes between the two eyes in the control subjects.NIRS may be useful in detecting visual dysfunction objectively and noninvasively in patients with visual disturbance, especially when used at the bedside.",

        "abstract": "\n We theoretically investigate the effects of the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) in the low-intensity regime where multiphoton\n ionization is the dominant mechanism for ionization. For atoms with low-ionization threshold such as Cesium, total ionization\n yield barely exhibits phase dependence. However, population of some bound states clearly shows dependence on the CEP. This\n implies that the measurement of the CEP would be possible through the photoemission between bound states without energy and\n angle-resolved photoelectron detection. The proposed scheme could be particularly useful to measure the CEP for a light source\n without an amplifier, such as a laser oscillator, which cannot provide sufficient pulse energy to induce tunneling ionization.\n Similar findings are also obtained for hydrogen, which shows stronger phase dependence not only for the bound state population\n but also for the total ionization yield.\n \n ",

The laser wavelength is chosen near\n the | 2s2p\n 1\n P autoionization structure and the dynamics are explored. Single and double ionization yields, as well as the photoelectron\n energy spectrum for photon energies around the autoionization structure are calculated. In the case of a pulse of few femtoseconds\n duration, no significant enhancement of the double ionization yield has been found in tuning the photon frequency around the\n peak of the resonance. It is also shown that in the case of a long pulse (and hence narrow compared with the relevant autoionization\n width), the branching ratio of double to single ionization yield can be relatively enhanced by tuning to the absorption minimum\n of the resonance.",

The mechanism of our method is that the precursor of the metal nanoparticles, i.e., the metallic ions, is very rapidly reduced in the laser-heated polymer matrix without any reducing agent. Unlike other known laser-induced reduction methods using UV lasers, which produce radicals to promote reduction, the CO laser energy is mainly absorbed by the glass substrate, and the laser-heated substrate heats the polymer matrix through heat diffusion to promote reduction. The superiority of the use of CO lasers over nanosecond visible~UV lasers is also demonstrated in terms of the damage to the film. The developed method can be a new alternative to quickly synthesize a variety of polymer-metal nanocomposite films.",

        "abstract": "We study the morphological change of crystalline polymer films by annealing using atomic force microscope, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. As typical samples, we employ high-density and low-density polyethylene films prepared by the cast method. After annealing at 135\u2009\u00b0C for 4\u2009h, the surface roughness of polyethylene films by the atomic force microscope significantly increases, and the crystallite size by the X-ray diffraction also shows some increase, while the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum hardly exhibits any change. This can be well explained as a result of the growth of crystal structure by recrystallization during annealing. More interestingly, we find that the choice of the substrate and also the heating/cooling rates for annealing significantly influences the surface roughness of the films.

        "abstract": "Abstract   We systematically investigate the formation of nanostructures in magnetron-sputtered Au films using a CO 2  laser. By comparing the optical properties and surface morphologies of Au films on different kinds of substrates before and after laser irradiation with different laser powers and irradiation times, we find that the nanostructures are most rapidly formed in the Au film with 5\u00a0nm thickness on a thin glass substrate. With the laser power of 6\u00a0W and a beam diameter of \u223c10\u00a0mm at the Au film, only a few tens of seconds of irradiation time is sufficient to induce nanostructures with the area size of \u223c10\u00a0mm in the 5\u00a0nm Au film on a thin glass substrate.",

The laser-heated dye molecules heat the polymer film through thermal diffusion, and accordingly the polymer film undergoes the structural change from the crystalline to amorphous structures, which is followed by the reverse structural change, namely recrystallization, during the natural cooling. By tuning the mid-IR probe pulse to one of the few structure-sensitive vibrational modes and varying the time delay between the pump and probe pulses we can monitor the structural change of the polymer film and time-varying film temperature during recrystallization through the transmission change of the resonant mid-IR probe pulse with the time-resolution of sub-\u03bcs.",

        "abstract": "We theoretically investigate the electron dynamics in Ne atoms involving core-excited states through the Ramsey scheme with a pair of time-delayed x-ray pulses. Irradiation of Ne atoms by the $ensuremath{sim}1$ femtosecond x-ray pulse simultaneously populates two core-excited states, and an identical but time-delayed x-ray pulse probes the dynamics of the core-excited electron wave packet which is subject to the resonant Auger decay. The energy-integrated total Auger electron yield and energy-resolved Auger electron spectra in the time domain show periodic structures due to the temporal evolution of the wave packet, from which we can obtain the counterpart in the frequency domain through the Fourier transformation. The Auger electron energy spectra in the time as well as frequency domains show the interference patterns between the two Auger electron wave packets released into the continuum from the superposition of two core-excited states at different times. These spectra are important to clarify the individual contribution of the different Auger decay channels upon core excitation by the x-ray pulse.",

        "abstract": "We theoretically study the ionization efficiency of Doppler-broadened atoms through a one-photon resonant two-photon ionization process using nanosecond pump and ionizing laser pulses. Under the presence of significant (u003e tens of GHz) Doppler broadening, the bandwidth of the transform-limited nanosecond pump pulse is far smaller than the Doppler width, and the use of the broadband nanosecond pulse rather than the transform-limited nanosecond pulse seems to be much more efficient to pump and eventually ionize atoms. It turns out, however, that the transform-limited nanosecond pump pulse with sufficient high intensity can outperform the broadband nanosecond pump pulse in the high intensity regime for the ionizing pulse, at which the other broadening mechanisms because of the strong pump and fast ionization play more important roles than the bandwidth of the pump pulse. Using a set of density matrix equations, we present specific numerical results for muoniums (\u03bc+e\u2212) with enormous Doppler widths (80 and 230 GHz), which support the above argument.",

Initialization is completed within the time scale of ten nanoseconds with high fidelity, and the initialization laser pulse can be linearly, right-circularly, or left-circularly polarized. Moreover, we demonstrate that the time required for initialization can be further shortened down to a few hundreds of picoseconds if we introduce a pillar-microcavity to promote the relaxation of a LH-trion state towards the desired ES state through the Purcell effect. We also clarify the role of heavy-hole and light-hole mixing induced transitions on the fidelity of ES state initialization.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTFluence-specified optimal control simulation is applied to C16O/C18O and 14N2/15N2 mixtures to numerically design laser pulses that best achieve isotope-selective alignment. The degree of control is measured in terms of selectivity, which is defined by the difference in the degree of alignment between a heavy isotopologue (HI) and a light isotopologue (LI). Optimal pulses are composed of several subpulses that cooperate with the so-called revivals of the rotational wave packets. Although the two mixtures have slightly different molecular parameters and isotope shifts, it turns out that the optimal pulses share common multi-pulse structures. We also develop a pulse-partitioning analysis to quantitatively and systematically examine the role of inter-subpulse cooperation in the improvement of the isotope-selective alignment. According to the analyses, we find that the \u2018coherent\u2019 and the \u2018incoherent\u2019 inter-subpulse cooperation almost equally contribute to the improvement of the degree of alignment (HI...",

        "abstract": "We present a semi-empirical calculational procedure for thep5nl bound excited states of rare gas atoms based on the use of an LS-dependent orbital for an excitednl electron outside a frozen Hartree-Fockp5 core. The spin-orbit interaction is accounted for approximately using a localized Hartree potential. The contribution from the long-range core polarization is estimated by using a parametrized potential. A model potential is also introduced to represent partially the short-range multi-electron interactions for thep5np levels. The energy levels are calculated by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix following anLS \u2192jl transformation. The calculated fine structure of the Nep5ns,p5np,p5nd, andp5nf \u00a6 (jl)KJ\u3009 levels are in close agreement with the observed level splittings. The transition probabilities are also in agreement with earlier theoretical and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "We theoretically show that the use of chirped laser pulses with an appropriate bandwidth is more favorable in achieving a higher degree of nuclear-spin polarization of atoms/ions. The physical origin of this is identified as multiple pump-dump processes during the single chirped laser pulse. As a specific example, we consider the case of muonium (\u03bc+e\u2212, lifetime 2.2\u00a0\u03bcs). By numerically solving a set of density matrix equations, we find that a chirped 1\u00a0ns pulse with a narrow bandwidth instead of a broad bandwidth efficiently induces a resonant pump and following dump processes within a single laser pulse, thereby transferring the angular momentum of the circularly polarized pump pulse to the atoms, which leads to the higher degree of nuclear-spin polarization. For muoniums at rest, a single chirped 1\u00a0ns pulse with a 4\u00a0GHz bandwidth and peak intensity of 2\u00d7106\u2009\u2009W/cm2 leads to 43% of nuclear-spin polarization, which is to be compared with 33% of nuclear-spin polarization by the transform-limited 1\u00a0ps pulse or chirped 1\u00a0ns pulse with a 400\u00a0GHz bandwidth for both. We also find that an introduction of the chirp does not help in the presence of significant Doppler broadening. This means that the use of chirped laser pulses is beneficial for the atomic beam at the cross-beam geometry, where the influence of Doppler broadening is negligible, and similarly, if a slow muonium beam is realized in the future to nearly eliminate Doppler broadening, then chirped laser pulses would be useful to attain a higher degree of nuclear-spin polarization.",

The mean nuclear DNA content (MNDC) of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas was significantly larger than that of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas both in Stages I + II and III + IV (P less than 0.001, each), and the MNDC of Stages III + IV was significantly larger than that of I + II in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (P less than 0.01). There was a tendency for histogram Patterns III and IV, in which more aneuploid cells were present than in I and II, to be more common and for the incidence of the aneuploid stem cell line to be higher in less differentiated and more advanced adenocarcinomas, although the differences were not significant statistically. Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations between MNDC and MNA (P less than 0.01) and between MNDC and SDNA (P less than 0.05). The averages of the MNA according to the histogram pattern increased significantly in the increasing order of Patterns I to IV. These results indicate that the nuclear DNA content increases in less differentiated and more advanced adenocarcinomas, and that the nuclear atypia is reflected in abnormal nuclear DNA content (DNA aneuploidy).",

An acinar pattern was predominant although every component seen in the normal salivary gland was present, namely, serous and mucous gland acini, ducts, myoepithelial cells, adipose and lymphoid tissue. Large eosinophilic granules were abundant in the large acinar cell cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumour demonstrated the proteins which are present in the normal parotid gland, for example, amylase, lactoferrin and lysozyme. Electron microscopic features were quite similar to those of normal parotid tissue except for accumulation of a large number of cytoplasmic granules in the acinar cells. There has been no previous report of a tumour with the same features as seen in this case. Our pathological diagnosis is hamartoma, although the possibility of hyperplasia or neoplasia can not be excluded.",

Although it is histologically very simple, its poorly differentiated epithelial cell characteristics are complicated by features of neuroendocrine cells, such as amine and peptide hormone production and specific enzyme activities, some of which have been found to be good monitoring markers during and after treatment. Because of the relative ease of establishing cell lines in vitro, cell characteristics have been studied in detail. This has led to subtyping of cell lines and may further lead to subtyping of histology. However, accumulation of further evidence has disclosed exceptions and unclassifiable cell lines. The same can be said about chromosomal abnormality. The reactivity of monoclonal antibodies and also oncogenes supports the prevalent concept discriminating small cell cancer from non-small cell cancer. However, concepts concerning histogenesis are still changing. Although it is one of the solid tumors most sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy, the response rate of the tumor to non-surgical treatment appears to have reached a plateau. In order to make a breakthrough in the treatment, strategies based on biological findings must be applied.",

Seven of them arose primarily in the lower extremities, three in the head and neck region, and two in other parts. ASPSs in the head and neck region occurred in children before 10 years of age, whereas ASPSs in the other regions occurred in rather older patients. Moreover, ASPSs of the head and neck were relatively small in size, and were diagnosed earlier than those in other regions. Histologically, six cases (including all the head and neck cases) contained considerable area of small and indistinct alveolar structures. Four cases showed remarkable cellular pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical demonstration of vimentin, desmin, the beta-subunit of enolase and the MM isozyme of creatine kinase, together with the absence of immunoreactive cytokeratin, supported the myogenic nature of this rare tumor. A small number of S-100 protein-positive tumor cells were also observed. Follow-up data for these cases disclosed that the tumors containing considerable area of small alveoli and uniform small tumor cells formed distant metastases at an early stage.",

That is, it consisted of \"classic\" small cells in the former medium, but after eight passages in the latter medium many cells became squamous cells, possessing abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and intercellular bridges. Immunohistochemically, they reacted to antikeratin and antiinvolucrin antibodies. Electron microscopically, well developed desmosomes and associated tonofibrils were noted, and electrophoretically, the amount of medium (Mr 57,000 and 59,000) and large-sized (Mr 67,000) keratins were found to increase with the change of the medium. These changes reversed to the original small cell morphology within 4 weeks after addition of vitamin A (retinoic acid) to the medium. These findings suggested that deficiency of vitamin A caused the change of the cell from small to squamous cell and vice versa.",

        "abstract": "Metastatic tumors in the brain, liver, and regional lymph nodes (20 cases each) from patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung were examined by cytofluorometric analysis, and compared with the respective primary lung tumors. The nuclear DNA content of tumor cells was significantly increased in metastatic tumors in the brain and liver compared with the primary (P less than 0.01). However, the DNA content of metastatic tumors in regional lymph nodes was almost identical to that of the primary tumor in many instances. From the viewpoint of the nuclear DNA content of lung adenocarcinoma, blood-borne tumor cells in the brain and liver were considered likely to constitute a discrete tumor cell subpopulation, i.e., probably a more malignant one, different from the major subpopulation in the primary tumor, whereas lymphatic metastases in regional lymph nodes were similar to the primary. The subpopulation with an increased DNA content in hematogenous metastases were thought to have originated from a minor subpopulation in the primary tumor or to have developed at the metastatic site.",

Characterization of neoplastic histiocytes was performed by immunohistochemical staining for S100 protein, lysozyme, and nonspecific cross reacting antigen with carcinoembryonic antigen (NCA). The immunohistochemical characteristics of histiocytes were S100+lys-NCA- in eight MH and two Letterer-Siwe disease cases and S100-lys+NCA+ in the sarcomatous variant of MH. MH and Letterer-Siwe disease were considered to have derived from a specific S100+ histiocytic cell lineage (T-zone histiocyte with S100 protein) independent of the monocyte--macrophage system, from which a sarcomatous variant was derived. Leukemic change of MH was discussed with special reference to the maturation and differentiation of T-zone histiocytes.",

However, their stainability was much lower than that of normal myoepithelial cells. On the other hand, these neoplastic myoepithelial cell were always positive for vimentin. \"Mesenchymal\" cells and hyaline cells of pleomorphic adenoma and indifferent cells of adenoid cystic carcinoma were negative for both actin and myosin but positive for vimentin and occasionally also positive for keratin. The significance of vimentin staining in neoplastic myoepithelial cells and the coexpression of vimentin and keratin in some tumor cells is discussed.",

The main tumor was located in the posterior basal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung and showed intrabronchial polypoid growth. Multiple metastatic tumors were observed in regional lymph nodes and the visceral and parietal pleura. Histologically, the tumor was composed of sheets of plasma cells with mild atypia. A large amount of amorphous material resembling amyloid was observed in the tumors, and was more marked in the metastatic lesions. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were shown to contain monoclonal IgG-kappa immunoglobulin. The amorphous deposits were not identical to amyloid since congo red stain was negative and amyloid fibrils were not observed ultrastructurally. By Western blotting, immunoglobulin (IgG, kappa) was identified as the major component in an extract from the nodular deposits. In the preoperative serum from the patient, M-protein (IgG-kappa) was detected by immunoelectrophoresis. Bone marrow examination revealed no abnormality.",

However, no S-100 protein-positive cells were found in \"goblet cell type\" adenocarcinoma. In some cases of squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma, these dendritic cells were also observed though they were fewer in number. In all cases of small cell carcinoma, however, S-100 protein-positive dendritic cells were rare. Electron microscopic study of two adenocarcinomas clearly demonstrated many Birbeck granules in the cytoplasm of S-100 protein-positive dendritic cells and confirmed that S-100 protein-positive cells in lung cancer were identical with Langerhans cells.",

        "abstract": "Eighty-nine primary lung carcinomas and 23 metastatic lung tumors were immunohistochemically studied for the expression of pulmonary surfactant apoproteins, by using monoclonal (PE-10) and polyclonal antibodies. Surfactant apoprotein was demonstrated in the cytoplasm and/or nuclear inclusion bodies of only primary lung adenocarcinomas (36 of 75 cases), not in any other histologic type of primary lung carcinoma or in metastatic lung tumors. In primary lung adenocarcinoma, although typical type II pneumocyte type adenocarcinoma was not included in the current series, the majority of surfactant apoprotein-positive single cell type tumors were of the Clara cell type, with a single bronchial surface epithelial cell type, according to the light microscopic subclassification of adenocarcinoma cells. The Clara cell type adenocarcinomas could at times be distinguished only with difficulty from adenocarcinoma of type II pneumocyte type. Normal and hyperplastic type II pneumocytes were of course positive for surfactant apoprotein in the cytoplasm. However, none of the positive cells could definitely be identified as Clara cells in non-neoplastic lungs. The findings obtained in this study indicate that surfactant apoprotein is a good marker to distinguish adenocarcinoma of the lung from other histologic types of lung cancer and from neoplasms metastatic to the lung, and that type II pneumocytes and Clara cells, non-neoplastic and neoplastic, are morphologically and functionally closely related and might belong to the same cell lineage.",

Two different monoclonal antibodies, NCC-RAS-001 and RAP-5 were used for immunohistochemical study. Cancer cells of 16 cases (33%) and 15 cases (31%) were strongly positive for NCC-RAS-001 and RAP-5, respectively. The staining pattern of antibodies was heterogenous among cancer cells, even in the same case. Among various histologic type of lung cancers, squamous cell carcinomas and well-differentiated adenocarcinomas had a tendency to react more intensively than other histologic types of carcinoma. Immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibody NCC-RAS-004 revealed the presence of ras-p21 not only in cancer tissues but also in non-cancerous tissues in all cases analysed. In 13 cases (27%), cancer tissue expressed more than twice as much ras-p21 as non-cancerous tissues. Our study showed that the over-expression of ras-p21 in lung carcinomas compared with non-cancerous tissues was a relatively common phenomenon, especially in squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas.",

        "abstract": "Nine cases of malignant mesothelioma of pure epithelial and biphasic types (five pleural, three peritoneal, and one pericardial mesotheliomas), seven cases of benign adenomatoid tumor of the uterus, and 21 cases of peripheral pulmonary adenocarcinoma of non-mucus-producing type were examined immunohistochemically for expression of keratin, vimentin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), surfactant apoprotein, Lewis blood group antigens, and Tn antigen. The majority (78%) of the malignant mesotheliomas expressed keratin, but CEA and surfactant apoprotein were not detected in any mesotheliomas. On the other hand, pulmonary adenocarcinomas expressed not only keratin (100%), but also CEA (62%) and surfactant apoprotein (62%). The expression of Lewisa blood group antigen and Tn antigen was detected in 76% and 62% of the pulmonary adenocarcinomas, respectively, but only one mesothelioma was stained for Lewisa antigen. This study reveals that the majority of malignant mesotheliomas can be distinguished from pulmonary adenocarcinomas by immunohistochemcial staining for CEA, surfactant apoprotein, Lewisa antigen, and Tn antigen. Immunohistochemically, adenomatoid tumors behaved similarly to malignant mesotheliomas.",

        "abstract": "A sensitive sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay method for measurement of brain-type isozyme of human creatine kinase (CK-BB) was developed using purified antibodies specific to the B subunit. The assay system consisted of polystyrene balls with immobilized antibody F(ab')2 fragments and the same antibody Fab' fragments labelled with beta-D-galactosidase from Escherichia coli. The assay was highly sensitive and 1 pg of CK-BB was measurable. The assay was specific to the B subunit of creatine kinase (CK-B), and it cross-reacted about 25% with CK-MB, the heart-type isozyme. However, the assay showed no cross-reactivity with CK-MM, the muscle type-isozyme or with neuron-specific gamma gamma enolase. Coefficients of variation in within-run and between-run precision studies for serum CK-B were less than 8%. Serum CK-B levels in healthy adults of various ages (16-59 yr old) ranged from 0.25-1.44 ng/ml, whereas the CK-B concentrations in children (less than 10 yr old) were relatively high, ranging from 1.3-7.4 ng/ml. The CK-B levels in the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) could be determined by the present method, and they ranged from 0.10-0.76 ng/ml in the samples from patients with non-neuronal disorders. Determination of immunoreactive CK-B in the extracts of various human tissues confirmed previous reports that CK-B was distributed at high concentrations in the central nervous tissue, prostate, uterus, bladder, gastrointestinal tract and heart muscle.",

        "abstract": "The release of S-100 protein from epididymal fat pads was enhanced by epinephrine in vitro, and about 50% of S-100 protein in the tissue was released into the medium after 2-h incubation at 37 degrees C with 10 microM epinephrine. Similar results were obtained with the incubation of isolated adipocytes. The S-100 protein release was also enhanced by isoproterenol, norepinephrine, ACTH, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which all increase the lipolysis by increasing cyclic AMP levels in the tissue. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, could block the increase of S-100 protein release by catecholamines, indicating that the release was mediated by the beta-adrenergic effect of catecholamines. However propranolol had no suppressive effect on the enhancement of S-100 protein release by ACTH or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Insulin had an inhibitory effect on the epinephrine-enhanced S-100 protein release. Epinephrine or ACTH could not stimulate the S-100 protein release in the absence of Ca2+, whereas the epinephrine-enhanced glycerol release was not affected under the same conditions. The increase in S-100 protein release was induced by only a pretreatment of the tissue with epinephrine. However, the lipolysis in the tissue was not enhanced by the pretreatment alone. These results indicate that the release of S-100 protein from adipocytes is regulated by the hormones that have been known to control the lipolysis with a manner slightly different from that of lipolysis.",

        "abstract": "The subunits of S100 protein were isolated from surgically resected tissues of human malignant melanoma and schwannoma by means of an affinity chromatography followed by high performance liquid chromatography. The melanoma tissue gave rise to the alpha and beta subunits in almost equal quantities while the schwannoma tissue yielded only the beta subunit, indicating that the S100 subunits were distributed differently between these tumor tissues. This finding suggests that the cellular distribution of S100 subunits varies, so that the cells containing S100 protein can be classified into several types on the basis of the subunit composition.",

        "abstract": "The effect of catecholamines on the levels of S-100 protein and nervous system-specific enolase (NSE) in epididymal adipose tissue of Wistar rats in vivo was examined by sensitive enzyme immunoassay methods. Soluble S-100 protein levels in the adipose tissue of 9-12-week-old rats (1.46 +/- 0.19 microgram/mg protein) were decreased to less than 50% of those of controls by serial injection (for 4-7 days) of epinephrine (0.1 mg/day) or norepinephrine (0.15 mg) with, however, little effect on the levels of membrane-bound (pentanol-extractable) S-100 protein. A significant decrease in the soluble S-100 protein levels was observed at 2 h after a single injection of epinephrine (1.04 +/- 0.13 microgram/mg protein). On the other hand, levels of NSE subunit (gamma subunit or 14-3-2 protein) in adipose tissue (0.51 +/- 0.03 gamma gamma-equivalent pmol/mg protein) were increased to 170% of control by serial injection (for 7 days) of epinephrine or norepinephrine with little change of the level of enolase alpha subunit on a mg protein basis. Isoproterenol had no apparent effect on the levels of soluble S-100 protein and NSE subunit. These results suggest that the levels of S-100 protein and NSE in adipose tissue are regulated by catecholamines.",

A dose-dependent effect was observed for increased frequency of metaphases with SCE (r = 0.984, P less than 0.001) as well as chromosomal aberrations (r = 0.994, P less than 0.001), primarily chromatid gap or break, in vitro. SCE induction by carboplatin was less than that by cisplatin at the same concentration. When patients were treated with a single dose of carboplatin at a dose of 450 mg/m2, the frequency of SCE and chromatid type aberrations increased significantly. However, even when considering dose and peak plasma concentration in patients receiving carboplatin, it appears that the ability of carboplatin to induce SCE and chromosomal aberrations is weaker than that of cisplatin. SCE frequencies induced by carboplatin decreased with time going by, and in one patient who was tested 5 weeks after treatment, SCE frequency showed a decrease to the pretreatment level. It thus appears that carboplatin has an improved therapeutic index over the parent compound, cisplatin, because of its less mutagenic or carcinogenic hazard, in addition to the largely reduced incidence of untoward effects.",

A significant increase in frequencies of SCE was observed in patients treated with cyclophosphamide plus adriamycin plus vincristine as compared with those treated with cisplatin plus etoposide in small cell lung cancer. A significant inverse correlation was observed between SCE frequencies in the peripheral lymphocytes 7 days after treatment (x) and the nadir value/pretreatment value of platelets (y)(r = -0.685, P = 0.0007, y = 0.842-0.022x).

        "abstract": "There is no standard chemotherapy for pulmonary large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and this type of cancer is difficult to diagnose using biopsy specimens. At the Shizuoka Cancer Center, when small biopsy specimens are used, they are diagnosed as high-grade non-small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (HNSCNEC) and the patients are treated according to the small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) guidelines. Amrubicin is an effective second-line treatment for patients with SCLC, although it remains unclear whether amrubicin monotherapy is effective for patients with LCNEC or HNSCNEC. Between September, 2004 and December, 2013, 18 patients with advanced LCNEC or HNSCNEC received amrubicin monotherapy in the second-line setting. The efficacy and toxicity of this treatment were retrospectively assessed. A total of 6 patients had LCNEC and 12 patients had HNSCNEC. The patients included 13 men, and the median age was 66 years (range, 57-82 years). A total of 16 patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. All the patients had received platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment, and the median number of amrubicin cycles per patient was 4 (range, 1-9). The overall response rate was 11.1%. The median progression-free and overall survival were 4.0 and 9.1 months, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 44% of the patients, and grade 3 febrile neutropenia occurred in 17% of the patients. One patient developed pneumonia and succumbed to the disease. Non-hematological toxicities were generally mild and manageable. Therefore, the efficacy of amrubicin in the second-line setting for patients with LCNEC or HNSCNEC is limited. Development of new drugs and/or treatment strategies is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Background: One of the most interesting aspects relating to tumor heterogeneity is the relevance and clinical significance of mutant allele frequency (MAF) within a tumor. However, it remains unknown whether epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) MAF is associated with clinico-pathological features in patients. The aim of this study is to assess the clinico-pathological features associated with EGFR MAF in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.  Methods: Based on a biobanking system in conjunction with our institution, we assessed EGFR substitution mutation status using the pyrosequencing method.  Results: A total of 96 non-small cell lung cancer patients were identified as carrying EGFR substitution mutations using pyrosequencing to analyze histological and surgical specimens. In fifty-seven cases (59.4%) surgical specimens were taken and in 39 cases (40.6%) FFPE specimens were used. The median age of patients was 69 years (range: 37-84 years); stage IA/ IB/ IIA/ IIB/ IIIA/ IIIB/ IV, 32 (33.3%)/ 10 (10.4%)/ 7 (7.3%)/ 3 (3.1%)/ 5 (5.2%)/ 2 (2.1%)/ 37 (38.5%); mutation type L858R/ G719X/ L861Q, 85 (88.5%)/ 9 (9.4%)/ 2 (2.1%); histological type adenocarcinoma/ others, 90 (93.8%)/ 6 (6.2%); and median EGFR MAF was 18% (range: 6%-82%). The EGFR MAF did not differ significantly between 51 early stage (stage I, II) patients (53.1%, median: 19%) and 45 late stage (stage III, IV) patients (46.9%, median: 17%) (p = 0.48), 50 smoker patients (52.1%, median: 19%) and 46 never-smoker patients (47.9%, median: 16.5%) (p = 0.28), 58 non-elderly adults (\u2264 70) patients (60.4%, median: 18.5%) and 38 elderly (u003e 70) patients (39.6%, median: 18%) (p = 0.37), and 47 male patients (49.0%, median: 19%) and 49 female patients (51.0%, median: 16.5%) (p = 0.13). However, the EGFR MAF was significantly elevated in 48 patients with moderately differentiated tumors (50.0%, median: 22%) compared to 30 patients with well differentiated tumors (31.3%, median: 13%) (p = 0.02) and 18 patients with poorly differentiated tumors (18.7%, median: 13%) (p = 0.01).  Conclusion: EGFR MAF, measured by pyrosequencing, was not significantly associated with differences in clinical background, but was significantly associated with pathological differentiation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

The patient was treated with osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) following treatment with nivolumab, an anti-Programmed Cell Death 1 (anti-PD1) antibody. After initiating osimertinib treatment, the patient began to complain of low-grade fever and shortness of breath without hypoxemia, and her chest radiograph and a CT scan revealed a remarkable antitumor response, although faint infiltrations were observed in the bilateral lung field. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid mainly contained lymphocytes (CD4+/CD8+ ratio of 0.3), and a transbronchial lung biopsy specimen showed lymphocytic alveolitis with partial organization in several alveolar spaces. Therefore we diagnosed the patient with osimertinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) after treatment with anti-PD1 antibody. We considered anti-PD1 therapies may be the risk factor of EGFR-TKI-induced ILD.",

        "abstract": "CYFRA 21-1 is a prognostic marker for non-small cell lung cancer. The serum CYFRA 21-1 level is also known as an adjunct for the diagnosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma. This study aimed to examine whether CYFRA 21-1 has predictive implications for nivolumab therapy in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Of the 79 patients who were treated with nivolumab therapy at the Shizuoka Cancer Center between December 2015 and September 2016, we retrospectively reviewed the data of 50 patients. The patient characteristics were as follows: age <70/\u226570\u2009years: 43 (86%)/7; male/female: 31 (62.0%)/19; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1/2: 43 (86%)/7; smoking status: no/yes: 18 (36%)/32; epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status negative/positive: 36 (72%)/14; CYFRA 21-1 \u22652.2/<2.2\u2009ng/mL: 28 (56%)/22; carcinoembryonic antigen \u22655/<5\u2009ng/mL: 29 (58%)/21; and number of prior regimens 2-3/\u22654: 16 (32%)/34. With a median follow-up of 263.5 (range, 64-352) days, the median progression-free survival was 70\u2009days. The clinical variables investigated using univariate analysis were as follows: age (p\u2009=\u20090.423), carcinoembryonic antigen (p\u2009=\u20090.888), epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status (p\u2009=\u20090.105), performance status (p\u2009=\u20090.968), sex (p\u2009=\u20090.210), number of prior regimens (p\u2009=\u20090.146), CYFRA 21-1 (p\u2009=\u20090.026), and smoking status (p\u2009=\u20090.041). A multivariate analysis identified a serum CYFRA 21-1 level \u22652.2\u2009ng/mL as an independent predictor of a favorable outcome (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.85; p\u2009=\u20090.015; median progression-free survival, 155 vs 51.5\u2009days). In conclusion, CYFRA 21-1 might be an independent predictor of outcome for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma treated with nivolumab.",

Several studies show that genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes influence the efficacy and toxicity of PEM. We aimed to investigate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms associated with the F pathway and clinical outcomes of Japanese patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSQ-NSCLC) treated with PEM plus cisplatin (CIS). Methods: We analyzed 38 polymorphisms in 15 genes associated with the F pathway in NSQ-NSCLC patients treated with PEM plus CIS: ABCC11, ADA, ATIC, CBS, DHFR, ERCC1, FPGS, GGH, MTHFD1, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, SHMT1, SLC19A1, and TYMS. These polymorphisms were compared with clinical outcomes such as response, toxicity, and progression-free survival (PFS) using Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test and the log-rank test. Results: All 56 patients were Japanese, with a median age of 62 years; 57.1% were male, 96.4% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0\u20131, 96.4% had sta...",

There are little data about genetic alterations in rebiopsy samples of NSCLC developing acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI in Asian patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations, who had undergone rebiopsy after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI. We analyzed 30 practicable samples using our tumor genotyping panel to assess 23 hot-spot sites of genetic alterations in 9 genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN and HER2), gene copy number of EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and FGFR2, and ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions using pyrosequensing plus capillary electrophoresis, quantitative PCR, and reverse transcription PCR, respectively.

        "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a tumor-derived material utilized for liquid-based biopsy; however, capturing rare CTCs for further molecular analysis remains technically challenging, especially in non-small cell lung cancer. Here, we report the results of a clinical evaluation of On-chip Sort, a disposable microfluidic chip-based cell sorter, for capture and molecular analysis of CTCs from patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Peripheral blood was collected from 30 metastatic lung adenocarcinoma patients to enumerate CTCs using both On-chip Sort and CellSearch in a blind manner. Captured cells by On-chip Sort were subjected to further molecular analysis. Peripheral blood samples were also used for detection of EGFR mutations in plasma using droplet digital PCR. Significantly more CTCs were detected by On-chip Sort (22/30, median 5, range 0-18 cells/5 mL blood) than by CellSearch (9/30, median 0, range 0-12 cells/7.5 mL) (p<0.01). Thirteen out of 30 patients who had a negative CTC count by CellSearch had a positive CTC count by On-chip Sort. EGFR mutations in CTCs captured by On-chip Sort were observed in 40.0% (8/20) of patients with EGFR mutated primary tumor. EGFR mutations were often observed in 53.3% (8/15) of patients detected in plasma DNA. Expressions of EGFR and vimentin protein on CTCs were also successfully assessed using On-chip Sort. These results suggest that On-chip Sort is an efficient method to detect and capture rare CTCs from patients with lung adenocarcinoma which are undetectable with CellSearch. Mutation detection using isolated CTCs remains to be further tackled (UMIN000012488) This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

But there have been few reports about molecular profiling of small cell lung cancers (SCLC). We conducted the Shizuoka Lung Cancer Mutation Study to analyze driver mutations in patients with thoracic SCLC malignancies. Methods: We collected molecular profiling data of SCLC from the biobanking system in conjunction with the clinic, including the pathology lab, where 23 mutations in 9 genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN and HER2), EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and FGFR2 amplifications, and EML4-ALK translocations were assessed using pyrosequensing plus capillary electrophoresis, qRT-PCR, and RT-PCR, respectively. To evaluate mutation status for SCLC patients, we collected patient characteristics data from medical records. Results: Between July 2011 and July 2012, fifty small cell lung cancer patients were assessed in our biobanking system. ...",

After disease progression with ASP3026 treatment, LDK378 (ceritinib) was initiated at a dose of 750mg once daily. A follow-up CT scan revealed a second drastic regression of the pleural lesion. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that this case represents the use of serum hyaluronan levels to assist in monitoring of treatment efficacy in an IMT.

The patient was a 19-year-old female, who noticed swelling in the right oral floor. Under a diagnosis of a sublingual tumor, tumor resection was performed. The tumor consisted of atypical round to short spindle-shaped cells that exhibited a hyalinized stroma and a trabecular growth pattern. The tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin, MyoD1, and bcl-2, whereas they were partially positive for desmin, cytokeratin (CK)7, CK5/6, and MDM2. They were negative for pan-CK, S-100 protein, and CD99(MIC2). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis did not detect any  FOXO1A  or  NCOA2  gene split signals. The cancer cells harbored a point mutation in codon 122 of the  MYOD1  gene. This case was finally diagnosed as SRMS. We discuss the differentiation of SRMS from salivary gland tumors.",

The patient was a 72-year-old Japanese male, who had noticed swelling of the left parotid region 21 years ago. A superficial lobectomy was performed. About 60% of the tumor was made up of cribriform and trabecular tissue composed of basaloid cells, which exhibited mild atypia and nuclear expression of \u03b2-catenin. This portion of the tumor was considered to be a BCA. In the other part of the tumor, the proliferation of large eosinophilic atypical cells, most of which formed intraductal structures, was observed. These tumor cells displayed cellular atypia, and some of them formed Roman bridge structures or contributed to intracapsular invasion. Immunohistochemically, these cells were positive for cytokeratin 7, gross cystic disease fluid proten-15 (GCDFP-15), androgen receptor (AR), and mammaglobin (MMG) and exhibited a high Ki-67 labeling index. So, this portion of the tumor was considered to be a salivary duct carcinoma (SDC). The tumor's final diagnosis was SDC ex BCA (intracapsular type), which is extremely rare. GCDFP-15, AR, MMG, and Ki-67 are useful immunohistochemical markers for diagnosing SDC ex BCA.",

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is extremely rare in the salivary glands. We report two cases of acantholytic SCC (ASCC) ex PA. Case 1 involved a 72-year-old female, and case 2 involved a 67-year-old male. Histologically, both cases involved PA, and salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) components, which were positive for androgen receptor (AR) and gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP)-15 but negative for HER2, were seen in the intracapsular regions. The invasive components consisted of ASCC, which were positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63 but negative for AR and GCDFP-15. The SDC and ASCC components were positive for the epidermal growth factor receptor. In both cases, the cytoplasmic localization or decreased expression of E-cadherin was observed in the ASCC. In the early phase, CXPA might emerge as SDC, and it might change into SCC as it invades beyond the capsule due to changes in microenvironment. Also, the aberrant expression of E-cadherin is related to acantholysis in SCC.",

Here, we examined the gene mutation and expression profiles of NEC using whole exome sequencing (WES) and microarray analysis. Six patients with gastric NEC and 13 with gastric adenocarcinoma (GAD) were included in this study. Single nucleotide variants were compared and multivariate statistical investigation with orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed to compare the difference in expression profiles between NEC and GAD. NEC showed a significantly higher mutation rate than GAD and the percentage difference in the mutation pattern of NEC compared with GAD was 92.8%. OPLSDA clearly discriminated between NEC and GAD. We identified 35 genes, including CPLX2 (Complexin 2), which were expressed more strongly in NEC than in GAD, of which 14 were neural-related. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the strong expression of CPLX2 in all NECs, versus expression in only 2 of 13 GADs. Gastric NEC had a specific mutation pattern with a significantly higher gene mutation rate than GAD, and completely differed from GAD on the basis of gene expression profile. CPLX2 might be a potential novel biomarker for the diagnosis of NEC.",

        "title": "Abstract 2248: Plasma epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (EGFR) testing in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients harboring EGFR mutations by chip-based digital PCR system",
        "abstract": "Background: EGFR mutation testing is important in the treatment decision for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because T790M mutation in exon 20 is associated with approximately 50% of cases resistant to treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), the importance of re-biopsy for detecting T790M mutation during EGFR-TKI therapy is increasing. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is recognized as a promising target of minimally invasive diagnosis. Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a new PCR technology for accurate quantification of the copy number of target molecules from low-input DNA. This study aimed to develop a blood-based EGFR mutation analysis in patients with advanced NSCLC by using a chip-based dPCR system that enables easy handling at a moderate costs.  Methods: From October 2013 to March 2014, 49 patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR-activating mutations detected with the Scorpion ARMS method were enrolled in this study. ctDNA samples were extracted from plasma samples of 21 and 28 patients before treatment and after progression with EGFR-TKI, respectively. dPCR was performed on the QuantStudio 3D (QS3D) Digital PCR System (Life Technologies) by using 20 ng ctDNA, TaqMan probes for three EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion, L858R in exon 21, and T790M in exon 20), and QS3D Digital PCR 20K Chips (2 chips per assay), according to the manufacturer9s instructions. The performance of the dPCR assay was assessed by using HDx Reference Standards (Horizon) containing each mutant sequence serially diluted with that containing wild-type EGFR sequence.  Results: Mutation of 0.1% was successfully detected in the dPCR assay for the three EGFR mutations. The median copy numbers of the EGFR mutation-positive samples were 2.9 copies (range, 0.3-84.2) for exon 19 deletion, 5.1 copies (0.6-742.1) for L858R in exon 21, and 1.4 copies (0.6-36.9) for T790M in exon 20. The sensitivity and specificity of each dPCR assay calculated by comparison with corresponding tumor samples were 61.8% (21/34) and 93.3% (14/15) for exon 19 deletion, and 66.7% (10/15) and 100% (34/34) for L858R, respectively. The T790M mutations were detected in 43% (12/28) of the ctDNA samples after progression with EGFR-TKIs therapy but in none of the samples before treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Among the 12 patients with NSCLC harboring T790M mutation in ctDNA, T790M mutations were detected in 5 of the 11 patients who underwent re-biopsy.  Conclusions: This system showed similar performance to other dPCR assays used in previous studies (sensitivity: 66.6-92.0% and specificity: 95.7-100%). These results indicate the possibility that EGFR mutation testing with ctDNA using the chip-based dPCR for easy handling at a moderate costs is useful as a minimally invasive monitoring method in clinical settings.

        "abstract": "We performed allelotyping analysis at nine regions on chromosome 3p using 56 microdissected samples from 23 primary lung adenocarcinomas to examine the process of progression within individual lung adenocarcinoma with various grades of differentiation. Identical allelic patterns among various grades of differentiation were found in eight cases. Accumulation of allelic losses from high to lower differentiated portions was found in seven cases and accumulation of allelic losses from low to higher differentiated portions was found in five cases. Various allelic patterns among various grades of differentiation were found in three cases. These results suggested that allelic losses on 3p play an important role in morphological changes of lung adenocarcinomas. We also investigated the relationship between allelic losses on 3p and histological subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma. The frequencies of allelic losses at 3p14.2 and telomeric region of 3p21.3 were higher in papillary type tumour (nine out of 14, 64% and 11 out of 15, 73%) than in bronchioloalveolar carcinoma-type tumour (one out of 8, 13%; P=0.031 and four out of 12, 33%; P = 0.057). These results indicated that allelic losses at 3p14.2 and telomeric region of 3p21.3 are related to pattern of the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma.",

        "abstract": "The association of p53 abnormalities with the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) has been extensively investigated to date, however, this association is still controversial. Therefore, we investigated the prognostic significance of p53 mutations through exons 2 to 11 and p53 protein expression in 103 cases of stage I NSCLC. p53 mutations were detected in 49 of 103 (48%) tumors. Two separate mutations were detected in four tumors giving a total of 53 unique mutations in 49 tumors. Ten (19%) of mutations occurred outside exons 5-8. Positive immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein was detected in 41 of 103 (40%) tumors. The concordance rate between mutations and protein overexpression was only 69%. p53 mutations, but not expression, were significantly associated with a shortened survival of patients (P<0.001). Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between the types of p53 mutations and prognosis. p53 missense mutations rather than null mutations were associated with poor prognosis (P < 0.001 in missense mutations and P=0.243 in null mutations). These results indicated that p53 mutations, in particular missense mutations, rather than p53 expression could be a useful molecular marker for the prognosis of patients with surgically resected stage I NSCLC.",

The immunoreaction for S-100 is specifically confined to M\u00fcller cells and astrocytes. Long slender cytoplasmic processes of M\u00fcller cells and their participation in the formation of the inner and outer limiting membrane were clearly demonstrated with this immunoreaction. The cytoplasmic processes were also revealed to form continuous sheets surrounding blood vessels. Some somata of M\u00fcller cells were found in the outer nuclear layer. The results show that immunostaining for S-100 is useful for selective visualization of M\u00fcller cells in the mature retina.",

The VDF/TeFE films with a mixing ratio of mol % were melted at 170 \u00b0C for 30 min and then recrystallized at 116 \u00b0C for 300 min. The molecules in the resultant needle-like crystals had a \u03b2-phase form and showed 200/110 orientation, while the direction of each needle-like crystal was random in-plane. The remanent polarization of the 450-nm-thick VDF/TeFE films consisting of the needle-like crystals were estimated to be 62 mC/m2 from the electric displacement vs electric field (D\u2013E) hysteresis measurement at the applied field of 156 MV/m and the frequency of 10 Hz. The remanent polarization of 62 mC/m2 was approximately 50% larger than that of conventional VDF/TeFE films consisting of plate-like crystals.",

It was found that one-dimensionally grown domains were formed on highly crystallized needle-like crystals after local voltage pulse application. This is because each needle-like crystal consisted of parallel-stacked lamellae with chain folding along its major axis. In addition, it showed two-step domain growth processes, namely, inter lamella domain growth and the growth between lamellae. On the other hand, circular domains were formed on polycrystalline plate-like crystals and as-coated films.",

        "abstract": "A cooling system using the electrocaloric effect is investigated on the bases of the thermodynamic theory. The electrocaloric effect causes a temperature change of dielectric materials. In this study, we introduce a simple model of the cooling system including a target object, a heat removal body, and a dielectric material. We confirm that the temperature of the target object certainly decreases. Furthermore, we propose an efficient control procedure of the electric field for cooling the target object. As a result, we show that the temperature change is enhanced by the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We investigated how to describe the difference between arbitrary two thermodynamic states by means of the thermo-field dynamics. Thermo-field dynamics plays a role of formulating to discuss statistical systems by focusing on the thermodynamic state itself. In this scheme, a thermodynamic state is expressed by a thermodynamic state vector. Thus, the difference between two thermodynamic states is well defined using the inner product of the relevant thermodynamic state vectors. In the present paper, we introduce the thermodynamic distance      D    thermo      to measure quantitatively the difference between the relevant two thermodynamic states, and we show some typical applications. As a result, we clarify that the concept of the thermodynamic distance includes a lot of information about statistical systems and it is helpful for us to obtain some characteristic parameters such as critical exponents or the quantum\u2013classical crossover point. Moreover, we find that the present method can be applied to flux currents.",

The VDF\u2013TrFE film deposited on the B-doped diamond showed good insulating and ferroelectric properties. Also, a Pt/VDF\u2013TrFE/B-doped diamond layered structure showed ideal behavior as a metal\u2013ferroelectric\u2013semiconductor (MFS) capacitor, and the memory window width was 11 V, when the gate voltage was swept from 20 to \u221220 V. The fabricated MFS-type FET structure showed the typical properties of a depletion-type p-channel FET and a maximum drain current density of 0.87 mA/mm at room temperature. The drain current versus gate voltage curves of the proposed FET showed a clockwise hysteresis loop owing to the ferroelectricity of the VDF\u2013TrFE gate insulator. In addition, we demonstrated the logic inverter with the MFS-type diamond FET coupled with a load resistor, and obtained the inversion behavior of the input signal and a maximum gain of 18.4 for the present circuit.",

Here, we demonstrated fabrication and characterization of FeFET based on MoS2 channel with vinylidene fluoride (VDF)-trifluoroethylene (TrFE) copolymer as back-gate insulator. In this device, counterclockwise hysteresis behavior was observed in the drain current\u2013gate voltage curve, which is indicative of interaction between MoS2 carrier modulation and ferroelectric polarization switching. Furthermore, our VDF-TrFE/MoS2 FeFET exhibited only n-type behavior, a maximum linear mobility of 625\u2009cm2/V\u2009s, a large memory window width of 16\u2009V, and a high on/off current ratio of 8\u2009\u00d7\u2009105.",

Spin-blocked states are transferred to the metastable state by loading an extra electron from a reservoir, leading to enhanced charge signals and readout fidelity above 99.7%. The high-fidelity readout allows for the analysis of the non-adiabatic Landau-Zener transition followed by charge relaxation during coherent singlet-triplet oscillation. The readout mechanism is robust against nuclear spin fluctuation and uncertainty of device conditions.",

We measure the tunneling current flowing between the center dot and either the left or right dot with the left and right leads as a common source and the center lead as a drain. In the biased stability diagram, we establish Pauli spin blockade in the respective neighboring dots, with features similarly obtained in double quantum dot systems. We further realize Pauli spin blockade with two different conditions by tuning the inter-dot coupling gates: strong and weak inter-dot tunnel coupling regimes. In the strong-coupling regime we observe significant suppression of co-tunneling through the respective double dots due to Pauli spin blockade. We reveal the influence from the third dot in the triple dot device on this co-tunneling Pauli spin blockade and clarify that the co-tunneling Pauli spin blockade is lifted by the resonant coupling of excited states to the third dot level as well as spin exchange of the left and right dots with the adjacent reservoir.",

Utilizing high-speed single-electron detection, we focus on dynamics induced by the first-order tunneling. We find that there is a difference between the spin and the charge relaxation: the former appears slower than the latter. The difference depends on the Fermi occupation factor and the spin relaxation becomes slower when the energy level of the quantum dot is lowered. We explain this behavior by a theory which includes the first-order tunneling processes. We conduct detailed comparison of the experiment and the theory with changing the energy of the quantum dot levels, and the theory can reproduce the experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Quantum dot arrays provide a promising platform for quantum information processing. For universal quantum simulation and computation, one central issue is to demonstrate the exhaustive controllability of quantum states. Here, we report the addressable manipulation of three single electron spins in a triple quantum dot using a technique combining electron-spin-resonance and a micro-magnet. The micro-magnet makes the local Zeeman field difference between neighboring spins much larger than the nuclear field fluctuation, which ensures the addressable driving of electron-spin-resonance by shifting the resonance condition for each spin. We observe distinct coherent Rabi oscillations for three spins in a semiconductor triple quantum dot with up to 25\u2009MHz spin rotation frequencies. This individual manipulation over three spins enables us to arbitrarily change the magnetic spin quantum number of the three spin system, and thus to operate a triple-dot device as a three-qubit system in combination with the existing ...",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate a new method for projective single-shot measurement of two electron spin states (singlet versus triplet) in an array of gate-defined lateral quantum dots in GaAs. The measurement has very high fidelity and is robust with respect to electric and magnetic fluctuations in the environment. It exploits a long-lived metastable charge state, which increases both the contrast and the duration of the charge signal distinguishing the two measurement outcomes. This method allows us to evaluate the charge measurement error and the spin-to-charge conversion error separately. We specify conditions under which this method can be used, and project its general applicability to scalable quantum dot arrays in GaAs or silicon.",

        "abstract": "Quantum coherence of superposed states, especially of entangled states, is indispensable for many quantum technologies. However, it is vulnerable to environmental noises, posing a fundamental challenge in solid-state systems including spin qubits. Here we show a scheme of entanglement engineering where pure dephasing assists the generation of quantum entanglement at distant sites in a chain of electron spins confined in semiconductor quantum dots. One party of an entangled spin pair, prepared at a single site, is transferred to the next site and then adiabatically swapped with a third spin using a transition across a multi-level avoided crossing. This process is accelerated by the noise-induced dephasing through a variant of the quantum Zeno effect, without sacrificing the coherence of the entangled state. Our finding brings insight into the spin dynamics in open quantum systems coupled to noisy environments, opening an avenue to quantum state manipulation utilizing decoherence effects.",

To access properties of local electronic states in nanostructures, such as local density of states, electronic distribution and so on, micro-probes utilizing artificial nanostructures have been invented to perform measurements in addition to those with conventional macroscopic electronic reservoirs. Here we demonstrate a new kind of micro-probe: a fast single-lead quantum dot probe, which utilizes a quantum dot coupled only to the target structure through a tunneling barrier and fast charge readout by RF reflectometry. The probe can directly access the local electronic states with wide bandwidth. The probe can also access more electronic states, not just those around the Fermi level, and the operations are robust against bias voltages and temperatures.",

Semiconductor quantum dots offer a good platform to explore the physics of open quantum systems because we can tune parameters including the coupling to the environment or leads. Here, we apply the fast single-shot measurement techniques from spin qubit experiments to explore the spin and charge dynamics due to tunnel coupling to a lead in a quantum dot-lead hybrid system. We experimentally observe both spin and charge time evolution via first- and second-order tunneling processes, and reveal the dynamics of the spin-flip through the intermediate state. These results enable and stimulate the exploration of spin dynamics in dot-lead hybrid systems, and may offer useful resources for spin manipulation and simulation of open quantum systems.",

        "abstract": "Measurements of quantum systems inevitably involve disturbance in various forms. Within the limits imposed by quantum mechanics, there exists an ideal projective measurement that does not introduce a back action on the measured observable, known as a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement. Here we demonstrate an all-electrical QND measurement of a single electron spin in a gate-defined quantum dot. We entangle the single spin with a two-electron, singlet-triplet ancilla qubit via the exchange interaction and then read out the ancilla in a single shot. This procedure realizes a disturbance-free projective measurement of the single spin at a rate two orders of magnitude faster than its relaxation. The QND nature of the measurement protocol enables enhancement of the overall measurement fidelity by repeating the protocol. We demonstrate a monotonic increase of the fidelity over 100 repetitions against arbitrary input states. Our analysis based on statistical inference is tolerant to the presence of the relaxation and dephasing. We further exemplify the QND character of the measurement by observing spontaneous flips (quantum jumps) of a single electron spin. Combined with the high-fidelity control of spin qubits, these results will allow for various measurement-based quantum state manipulations including quantum error correction protocols.",

However, initialization and readout of a qubit is orders of magnitude slower than control, which is detrimental for implementing measurement-based protocols such as error-correcting codes. In contrast, a singlet-triplet (ST) qubit, encoded in a two-spin subspace, has the virtue of fast readout with high fidelity and tunable coupling to the electric field. Here, we present a hybrid system which benefits from the different advantages of these two distinct spin-qubit implementations. A quantum interface between the two codes is realized by electrically tunable inter-qubit exchange coupling. We demonstrate a controlled-phase (CPHASE) gate that acts within 5.5 ns, much faster than the measured dephasing time of 211 ns. The presented hybrid architecture will be useful to settle remaining key problems with building scalable spin-based quantum computers.",

If waveform of the actual excitation input current is known, the simulation will fit the experiment for the electro-magnetic (EM) wave. In the present paper, an attempt was made to determine a standard simulated EM wave shape obtained by changing the rise time tr of the excitation waveform of a Gaussian pulse of 10-150 ps considering the propagation attenuation in the GIS. This comparison was performed in terms of both the transmission rate Tv of the peak-to-peak value Vpp of the EM wave intensity and the transmission rate Tw of the accumulated energy of the EM wave. The simulation used two types of PD sources: a high-voltage conductor-side particle and a tank-side free particle. The simulation revealed that as tr is shortened, both Tv and Tw decrease. As a result, it was found that a simulated excitation pulse with a rise time of 10-25 ps produced the best fit to the experimentally obtained Tv and Tw when the calculation was made for a straight GIS structure with two epoxy spacers for the two types of PD sources.",

An attempt was made to determine a standard wave shape of experimentally obtained EM wave for the simulated ones obtained by changing the rise time tr of the excitation waveform of Gaussian pulse from 25 ps to 200 ps with the propagation attenuation in GIS considered. This comparison was performed in terms of both transmission rate Tv of peak to peak value Vpp of EM wave intensity and transmission rate Tw of accumulated energy of the EM wave. The simulation revealed that as tr is shortened, both Tv and Tw decrease. As a result, it was found that simulated excitation pulse with the rise time of 25-50 ps allows the best fit to experimentally obtained Tv and Tw when the calculation was made for a straight GIS structure with two epoxy spacers for a free metal particle on the tank. Furthermore, the rise time of 25-50 ps for Tv and 100-150 ps for Tw was found to give the best fit to the experimental results for a protrusion on the high voltage conductor.",

One of the suppressing the magnetizing inrush current method is to control closing phase of the circuit breaker. For the controlled switching, it is very important to know the residual flux after the transformer was interrupted. So far the residual magnetic flux for the three-phase three-leg transformer has not been discussed. In this paper, the residual magnetic flux of a three-phase three-leg core type transformer is discussed by simulation and actual measurement. The residual magnetic flux for three-leg transformer is clear. It is shown that the controlled switching for three-phase three-leg transformer is able to apply.",

        "abstract": "Profound insight into age-related changes in \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA-R) distribution using iodine-123-iomazenil single photon emission computed tomography (IMZ-SPECT) can contribute to accurate in vivo evaluation. We evaluated the age-related changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is the key region involved in various neurological and psychiatric diseases. In this study, IMZ-SPECT imaging data of 21 healthy males with an age range of 22-59 (mean, 38\u202f\u00b1\u202f12) years were analyzed using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP). The Z-score images of the younger group (age\u202f<\u202f40, n\u202f=\u202f11) and the older group (age\u202f\u2265\u202f40, n\u202f=\u202f10) were compared. Subsequently, the mean RI-count ratios calculated for each Brodmann area (BA) by stereotactic extraction estimation method were compared between these groups. Thereafter, linear regression analysis between age and RI-count ratio was performed for all enrolled subjects. In the result, IMZ accumulation increased in bilateral BA10, 11, and the BA47 (left hemisphere) in the older group compared with the younger group. Furthermore, regression analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between age and RI-count ratio in these areas. Our findings indicate that GABAA-R distribution in the PFC relatively increases with age. Therefore, we concluded that the age-related changes should be considered to accurately evaluate pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric diseases.",

        "abstract": "In 2011, we developed a real-time RT-PCR method to rapidly and sensitively detect three subtypes of influenza A virus [H1N1, H3N2, and influenza (H1N1) 2009] and influenza B virus (the conventional PCR method). This method was useful during the 2011-2012 epidemic season. However, epidemic influenza A virus strain H3N2 in the 2012-2013 season was undetectable by this method, possibly due to mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) gene of epidemic influenza A virus strain H3N2. Therefore, we improved the method by using the hemagglutinin (HA) gene instead of the NA gene as the target for the detection of influenza A virus strain H3N2. In addition, this improved PCR method also included a PCR detection system for the matrix (M) gene, well conserved and common to all influenza A virus strains. As a result, influenza A virus strain H3N2, which was undetectable by the conventional PCR method, was positive by the improved PCR method. Testing of specimens from 219 influenza-like illness patients during the 2012-2013 season by the influenza antigen immunochromatographic assay and conventional and improved PCR methods showed influenza virus A-positive rates of 24.2, 1.8, and 28.3%, respectively. All influenza A virus strains were positive for the M gene (in 62 [28.3%] of the 219 patients). These results suggest that the improved PCR method can determine the presence or absence of influenza A virus infection, even if a mutation in the HA or NA gene occurs in the future.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: We sought to: (1) determine the distribution of GABAA receptors (GABAA-Rs) in the brain of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients; and (2) ascertain if the distribution pattern correlates with cognitive dysfunction.Methods: Fourteen DMD patients [young adults (n=7, 18-25 year-old and older adults (n=7, 30-37 year-old) groups] and 16 age-matched normal volunteers participated. GABAA-R distribution was assessed using 123I-IMZ-SPECT. Neuropsychological assessments were performed using 3 different test batteries, WAIS-III, WMS-R, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST).Results: All DMD patients showed significant decline in 123I-IMZ uptake in the prefrontal cortex (Pu003c0.05). While no differences were detected in the WAIS-III and WMS-R, the WCST scores of DMD patients (2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9) were significantly lower (Pu003c0.01) than those of normal volunteers (5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7). Both abnormalities were more pronounced in older adult patients.Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that DMD is accompanied by a reduction in the prefrontal cortex distribution of GABAA-Rs.

        "abstract": "The family of genes encoding T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing proteins (Tim), which are cell-surface molecules expressed in CD4(+) T helper cells, has important roles in the immune system. Here, we report three unusual patterns of genetic variation in the human hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 gene (HAVCR1) that are similar to patterns observed in major histocompatibility complex loci. First, levels of polymorphism in exon 4 of HAVCR1 were exceptionally high in humans (nucleotide diversity (pi)=45.45 x 10(-4)). Second, nonsynonymous substitutions and insertion/deletion variants were more frequent than synonymous substitutions in that exon (10 out of 12 variants). The rate of the mean number of nucleotide substitutions at nonsynonymous sites to synonymous sites at HAVCR1-exon 4 is >1 (P(A)/P(S)=1.92 and pi(A)/pi(S)=2.23). Third, levels of divergence among human, chimp, and gorilla sequences were unusually high in HAVCR1-exon 4 sequences. These features suggest that patterns of variation in HAVCR1 have been shaped by both positive and balancing natural selection in the course of primate evolution. Evidence that the effects of natural selection are largely restricted to the mucin domain of HAVCR1 suggests that this region may be of particular evolutionary and epidemiological interest.",
