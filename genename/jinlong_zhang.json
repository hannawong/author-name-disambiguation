        "abstract": "Recombinant human interferon-\u03c9 (rhIFN-\u03c9) exhibits a potent antiviral activity. Because of poor pharmacokinetics (PK) of rhIFN-\u03c9, frequent dosing of rhIFN-\u03c9 is necessitated to achieve the sustained antiviral efficacy. PEGylation can efficiently improve the PK of rhIFN-\u03c9 while substantially decrease its bioactivity. The structure, antiviral activity and PK of the PEGylated rhIFN-\u03c9 were measured to establish their relationship with PEGylation sites, polyethylene glycol (PEG) mass and PEG structure. Accordingly, N-terminus and the lysine residues were selected as the PEGylation sites. PEGs with Mw of 20kDa and 40kDa were used to investigate the effect of PEG mass. Linear and branched PEGs were used to investigate the effect of PEG structure. PEGylation decreased the antiviral activity of rhIFN-\u03c9 and improved its PK. The PEGylation sites determine the bioactivity of the PEGylated rhIFN-\u03c9 and the conjugated PEG mass determines the PK. N-terminally PEGylated rhIFN-\u03c9 with 40kDa linear PEG maintains 21.7% of the rhIFN-\u03c9 antiviral activity with a half-life of 139.6h. Thus, N-terminally PEGylated rhIFN-\u03c9 with linear 40kDa PEG is a potential antiviral agent for long-acting treatment of the viral diseases.",

Recombinant LcrV could be purified from the supernatant of the bacteria lysate after chromatography using a combination of Phenyl-Sepharose F F, DEAE-Sepharose F F and Hiload Superdex 75. The final yield of approximately 3 g of purified rLcrV from 42 L bioreactor containing 25 L LB medium was obtained. High-titer IgG directed against rLcrV was detected positive after immunization on the BALB/c mice.

The plasmid was then transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. The target protein was expressed under the induction of IPTG. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were used to identify the expression products. The specific binding activity to TeNT-Hc and relative stability in vitro of 27G-scdsFv were assayed by ELISA, and the affinity of the antibody was measured by non-competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay. The method of immunofluorescence was employed to determine whether or not the 27G-scdsFv kept the neutralizing activity in vitro.Sequencing analysis proved that 27G-scdsFv gene was correctly constructed. The target protein was expressed in the form of inclusion body, accounting for about 50% of total bacterial proteins. After renaturated, the 27G-scdsFv protein still maintained specific binding activity to TeNT-Hc, with a higher affinity constant (K(D);) of 0.93\u00d710(-7); mol/L as compared with that of 27G-scFv, and the yield of the protein was about 5 mg/L induced culture. The relative stability of 27G-scdsFv was improved obviously as compared with the scFv form. 27G-scdsFv strongly inhibited the binding of TeNT-Hc to PC-12 in vitro.The porkaryotic expression vector of 27G-scdsFv has been successfully constructed and the activated target protein has been obtained, which lays a foundation for the further study on the biological function of 27G-scdsFv.",

In this study, the authors have investigated the antibody responses and the protective efficacy when the antigens were administered separately or in combination intramuscularly formulation adsorbed to an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Results show that immunized rF1 + rV and rPA antigen together was as effective as separately for induction of serological antibody response, and these titers were maintained for over 1 year in mice. An isotype analysis of the serum indicates that the co-administration of these antigens did not influence the antigen-specific IgG1/IgG2a ratio which was consistent with a Th2 bias. Furthermore, the combined vaccine comprising the protein antigens rF1 + rV + rPA has been demonstrated to protect mice from subcutaneous challenge with 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) virulent Y. pestis strain, and to fully protect rabbit against subcutaneous challenge with 1.2x10(5) colony-forming units (CFU) virulent B. anthracis spores.

        "title": "Safety and immunogenicity of a novel recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine in healthy adults in China: preliminary report of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial.",
        "abstract": "Up to now, all tested Ebola virus vaccines have been based on the virus strain from the Zaire outbreak in 1976. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a novel recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine expressing the glycoprotein of the 2014 epidemic strain.We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 clinical trial at one site in Taizhou County, Jiangsu Province, China. Healthy adults (aged 18-60 years) were sequentially enrolled and randomly assigned (2:1), by computer-generated block randomisation (block size of six), to receive placebo, low-dose adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine, or high-dose vaccine. Randomisation was pre-stratified by dose group. All participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was occurrence of solicited adverse reactions within 7 days of vaccination. The primary immunogenicity endpoints were glycoprotein-specific antibody titres and T-cell responses at day 28 after the vaccination. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02326194.Between Dec 28, 2014, and Jan 9, 2015, 120 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=40), low-dose vaccine (n=40), or high-dose vaccine. Participants were followed up for 28 days. Overall, 82 (68%) participants reported at least one solicited adverse reaction within 7 days of vaccination (n=19 in the placebo group vs n=27 in the low-dose group vs n=36 in the high-dose group; p=0\u00b70002). The most common reaction was mild pain at the injection site, which was reported in eight (20%) participants in the placebo group, 14 (35%) participants in the low-dose group, and 29 (73%) participants in the high-dose vaccine group (p<0\u00b70001). We recorded no statistical differences in other adverse reactions and laboratory tests across groups. Glycoprotein-specific antibody titres were significantly increased in participants in the low-dose and high-dose vaccine groups at both day 14 (geometric mean titre 421\u00b74 [95% CI 249\u00b77-711\u00b73] and 820\u00b75 [598\u00b79-1124\u00b70], respectively; p<0\u00b70001) and day 28 (682\u00b77 [424\u00b73-1098\u00b75] and 1305\u00b77 [970\u00b71-1757\u00b72], respectively; p<0\u00b70001). T-cell responses peaked at day 14 at a median of 465\u00b70 spot-forming cells (IQR 180\u00b70-1202\u00b75) in participants in the low-dose group and 765\u00b70 cells (400\u00b70-1460\u00b70) in those in the high-dose group. 21 (18%) participants had mild fever (n=9 in the placebo group, n=6 in the low-dose group, and n=6 in the high-dose group). No serious adverse events were recorded.Our findings show that the high-dose vaccine is safe and robustly immunogenic. One shot of the high-dose vaccine could mount glycoprotein-specific humoral and T-cell response against Ebola virus in 14 days.China National Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, and Tianjin CanSino Biotechnology.",

The light chain gene of the chimeric antibody was obtained by fusing the variable region gene of the mouse mAb light chain with the human kappa constant region gene. Both the heavy and light chain genes of the chimeric antibody were further verified by sequencing. The chimeric antibody heavy and light chain genes were inserted into EcoR I/Not I of pcDNA3.1 (+) to construct expression plasmids termed pcDNA3.1-L and pcDNA3.1-H, respectively. Then, two plasmids were mixed and transfected into CHO-S cells. Finally, the stable cell clone secreting chimeric antibody was obtained by G418 selection. The culture supernatants of serum-free medium were collected and the chimeric antibody was purified by MabSelect SuRe affinity chromatography. The purified chimeric antibody was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, ELISA and evaluated in the protective effect in vivo.PCR and sequencing analysis proved that plasmids pcDNA3.1-H and pcDNA3.1-L were correctly constructed. Dot blot showed that a cell line with high-level expression of chimeric antibody was obtained. SDS-PAGE and western blot showed that the chimeric antibody was successfully purified. ELISA showed that the chimeric antibody could specifically bind to F1 antigen. In vivo activity assay showed that 80% BALB/c mice treated with the chimeric antibody survived from 36 MLD virulent Yersinia pestis.The chimeric antibody against F1 antigen with neutralizing activity was successfully expressed in CHO-S cells, which laid a foundation for the preparation of anti-plague passive immunity agents.",

        "abstract": "Enterovirus71 (EV71) is the major causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease, which threatens the health of infants and young children. The expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by this viral infection aggravate the illness. Here, we describe the anti-EV71 activity of a specific p38 inhibitor that regulates the p38-MAPK signaling pathway. PD169316 was specifically selected from a MAPK compound library due to its significant inhibitory effect on EV71 replication. PD169316 also reduced EV71-induced apoptosis. Animal experiments showed that PD169316 can dampen the replication of EV71, reduce tissue damage and inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines, thereby alleviating the severe diseases caused by EV71 in suckling mice.",

Only one monoclonal antibody has been identified to date that provides complete protection against Y. pestis. Here, we describe a second novel murine monoclonal antibody (F2H5) that provided complete protection against Y. pestis 141 infection when administered prophylactically to Balb/c mice (100 \u03bcg intravenously). We humanized F2H5, characterized its ability to bind to the Y. pestis F1 protein and further characterized the neutralizing epitope using computational and experimental approaches. While Western blot results suggested a linear epitope, peptide mapping using ELISA failed to identify an epitope, suggesting a conformational epitope instead. We adopted a computational approach based on Residue Contact Frequency to predict the site of antigen-antibody interaction and defined the F2H5/F1 binding site computationally. Based on computational approach, we determined that residues G104E105N106 in F1 were critical to F2H5 binding and that CDRH2 and CDRH3 of F2H5 interacted with F1. Our results show that combining computational approach and experimental approach can effectively identify epitopes.",

        "abstract": "An apparent increase in the frequency of human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-4) infections among general populations has been observed over the past 10 years. However, available epidemiological data that may reflect previous viral circulation and assist in predicting potential outbreaks are sparse, particularly in mainland China and Africa. In this study, a convenient neutralization assay for use in the surveillance of historical HAdV-4 infections was established based on a recombinant luciferase-expressing virus. Subsequently, the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) of 1013 healthy adult serum samples from China and Sierra Leone were evaluated. Our results showed that over 50% of the participants from China and nearly 70% of donors from Sierra Leone had detectable nAbs against HAdV-4 despite the few infection cases officially reported in these regions. Furthermore, the prevalence of nAbs to HAdV-4 is lower than that to HAdV-5, and both varied by geographic location. In addition, the seropositive rates of both HAdV-4 and HAdV-5\u00a0nAbs increased with age. However, the nAbs stimulated by HAdV-4 remained stable at low (\u2264200) levels among the different age groups, whereas moderate (201-1000) or high (>1000) nAb levels were produced by HAdV-5 and tended to decrease with age. These results elucidate the human humoral immune response against HAdV-4 and revealed that this virus may be an underestimated causative agent of respiratory disease among adults in China and West Africa, demonstrating the importance of HAdV-4 surveillance and providing useful insights for the future development of HAdV-4-based vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Edema toxin (ET), which is composed of a potent adenylate cyclase (AC), edema factor (EF), and protective antigen (PA), is one of the major toxicity factors of Bacillus anthracis. In this study, we introduced mutations in full-length EF to generate alanine EF(H351A) and arginine EF(H351R) variants. In vitro activity analysis displayed that the adenylyl cyclase activity of both the mutants was significantly diminished compared with the wild-type EF. When the native and mutant toxins were administered subcutaneously in a mouse footpad edema model, severe acute swelling was evoked by wild-type ET, while the symptoms induced by mutant toxins were very minor. Systemic administration of these EF variants caused non-lethal hepatotoxicity. In addition, EF(H351R) exhibited slightly higher activity in causing more severe edema than EF(H351A). Our findings demonstrate that the toxicity of ET is not abolished by substitution of EF residue His351 by alanine or arginine. These results also indicate the potential of the mouse footpad edema model as a sensitive method for evaluating both ET toxicity and the efficacy of candidate therapeutic agents.",

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, BET-specific surface area determination, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed a slight shift to longer wavelengths and an extension of the absorption in the visible region for almost all the ion-doped samples, compared to the non-doped sample. The photocatalytic activity of those catalysts was investigated for the liquid phase photocatatlytic degradation of active yellow XRG dye diluted in water under UV and visible light irradiation. It was found that the catalysts doped with FeCl 3 have better catalytic activity for photodegradation of XRG than those doped with FeCl 2 . The amount of doped iron ion plays a significant role in affecting its photocatalytic activity and iron doped with optimum content can enhance photocatalytic activity, especially under visible light irradiation.",

The obtained samples were characterized by XRD, UV-vis DRS, FTIR, FTIR-pyridine, XPS, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption methods. Compared with undoped TiO 2, the S-doped and sulfated TiO 2 photocatalysts exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity for phenol degradation under visible light irradiation. It was revealed that S was not only incorporated into the crystal lattice of TiO 2 replacing Ti 4+ (as S 4+) but also anchored on its surface in the form of SO 4 2-. Further study indicated that there are synergistic effects between doped S and anchored SO 4 2- on improving the visible light photocatalytic activity of TiO 2. The doped S can form an impurity level below the conduction band of TiO 2, extending the light response of TiO 2 into visible light region, while SO 4 2- anchored on TiO 2 surface is favorable for trapping photo-induced electrons, suppressing the recombination of electrons and holes and consequently promoting the formation of hydroxyl radical. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V..",

Various strategies were adopted to eliminate the passivation of the non-aromatic organic intermediates in the Fenton-like degradation of Orange II. UV irradiation, visible irradiation, hydroquinone (HQ) additive and their hybrid were used to accelerate the decoloration of Orange II; however, some of them were failed to show a good performance in the presence of non-aromatic organics, especially for the mineralization of Orange II. Aluminum ions additive released the ferric ions via a competitive chelation process, and accelerated the reaction obviously. From the decoloration and the mineralization data of Orange II, UV irradiation combined with Al(3+) ion additive was regarded as the most favorable strategy for deep mineralization of Orange II by Fe(3+)/H(2)O(2) in the presence of non-aromatic intermediates. However, by considering the decoloration of Orange II with moderate mineralization, the combination of visible irradiation and Al(3+) ion additive might present the best performance.",

The structure and properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra. The photocatalytic efficiency was evaluated by monitoring the photocatalytic degradation of salicylic acid under visible light irradiation. It was verified that TiO2 co-doped with nitrogen and 1% europium showed the highest photocatalytic activity. The adsorption isotherms were obtained by measuring the salicylic acid concentration before and after the dark adsorption at different original solution concentrations. The results illustrated that the doping of Eu was beneficial to the adsorption of salicylic acid. The probable degradation mechanism of salicylic acid was examined by the addition of NaF, Na2S2O3, and K2S2O8 as the probe molecules. It was verified that salicylic acid was first adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts, followed by the degradation by the photogenerated holes (h  vb + ).",

The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nitrogen adsorptiondesorption. It was revealed that all samples consist of highly crystalline anatase with mesoporous structure. For Ag/BTiO2, B was doped into TiO2 matrix in the form of both interstitial B and substitutional B while Ag was deposited on the surface of BTiO2 in the form of metallic silver. Compared with the single B-doped or Ag-loaded TiO2 one, mesoporous Ag/BTiO2 exhibits much higher visible light photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine 6G, which can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of B doping and Ag loading by narrowing the band gap of the photocatalyst and preventing the fast recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers, respectively. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Single doped, co-doped and tri-doped TiO(2) with B, N and Fe are successfully synthesized by using the hydrothermal method. The samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic activities of the samples are evaluated for degradation of methyl-orange (MO, 20 mg L(-1)) in aqueous solutions under visible light (lambda > 420 nm). The results of XRD suggest that all the catalysts present anatase crystal. All the doping catalysts show higher photoactivities than pure TiO(2) under visible light irradiation. In the single nonmetal doped TiO(2), the localized dopant levels near the valence band (VB) are responsible for the enhancement of photoactivies. Fe(3+) impurity level formed under the conduction band (CB) induces the high photocatalytic activities of iron doped TiO(2). In the co-doped and tri-doped catalysts, the B 2p and N 2p acceptor states contribute to the band gap narrowing by mixing with O 2p states combined with the overlapping of the conduction band by the iron \"d\" orbital, resulting in improvement of the photo-performance under visible light irradiation. Iron co-doped with boron catalyst shows low photoactivity under visible light due to the absence of Fe(3+) impurity levels at the bottom of the conduction band. In addition, the XPS results indicate the presence of synergistic effects in co-doped and tri-doped catalysts, which contribute to the enhancement of photocatalytic activities.",

It was found that the TPD peak assigned to the adsorbed NO species observed at around 524 K is directly associated with a decline in the photocatalytic activity. The TPD spectrum of the adsorbed NO species consisted of three different types of species. The ?-adsorbed species of NO, formed under UV irradiation on the active surface sites, was found to cause a remarkable decline in the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. It was also found that this decline could be recovered to its original activity by heat treatment with Ar and/or O2 at around 573 K.",

The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform (FT)-IR spectra, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption methods. The contents of anatase and rutile phases in the TiO(2) powders have been successfully controlled by simply changing the proportion of Cl(-) and SO(4)(2-) in the aqueous phase of the microemulsion. A proposed mechanism involving bidentately chelated sulfate is discussed to explain the variation of the crystalline phase in the TiO(2) powder. The photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) in water has been investigated over titanium dioxide consisting of different anatase/rutile ratios. The catalyst containing 74.2% anatase showed the highest photocatalytic activity, which is due to a synergistic effect between anatase and rutile. The synergism was also found for the photodegradation of MO with physically mixed anatase and rutile as catalysts.",

        "abstract": "A TiO2/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst with an inverse opal structure and heterojunction has been successfully prepared by a relatively facile approach. The catalyst was characterized by a combination of XRD, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, PL, EIS and DRS techniques and applied for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants represented by Rhodamine B, phenol and levofloxacin. The results of RhB degradation showed that the rate constant of inverse opal TiO2/g-C3N4 with the best compound ratio is 0.184 min-1, which is 2.7 times faster than that of normal TiO2/g-C3N4 and 4.2 times faster than that of inverse opal TiO2. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity may be attributed to the matched overlapping band structure and the interaction between inverse opal g-C3N4 and TiO2. The inverse opal structure of g-C3N4 has improved the optical absorption properties of g-C3N4 and the interaction between inverse opal g-C3N4 and TiO2 creates more interfaces for the efficient transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs to restrict the recombination, which was proved from the photoluminescence spectra (PL). Moreover, a possible photocatalytic mechanism has been tentatively proposed according to the experimental results. All in all, both the inverse opal structure and heterojunction construction play significant roles in the excellent photocatalytic degradation performance according to the mechanism investigation.",

As-prepared B-TiO2 films with two layers were characterized by XRD, DRS, XPS and AFM. The photocatalytic characteristics were measured based on the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) solution under visible or UV light. The results indicated that the anatase phase was the main crystal form of the films, containing a small amount of brookite. The presence of boron caused a red shift in the absorption band of TiO2 films. The doped boron was mainly presented in the form of B2O3, O-Ti-B and O-Ti-B bonds, confirming that autoclaved-sol synthesis at low temperature allowed for incorporation of boron atoms into the TiO2 matrix. Transmission of the films was about 90% in the visible region. The 10% (atom) B-TiO2 film exhibited the best photocatalytic activity both in visible and UV light. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "AgBr/AgI at Ag composite photocatalyst was prepared by a handy multistep route, including controllable double-jet precipitation to synthesize cubic AgBr microcrystals, ion exchange to form AgI on AgBr surface, and visible light reduction to generate Ag nanoparticles. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance and electrochemical impedance spectra demonstrated that AgBr/AgI composite structure not only favors forming more silver nanoparticles to harvest visible light but also facilitates the transfer of charge carriers when compared with pure AgBr. Beneficial from the synergistic effect of highly effective visible light harvest and electron-hole separation, AgBr/AgI at Ag shows higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) than AgBr, AgBr at Ag, and AgBr/AgBr. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

The mesoporous materials were characterized by low angle and wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption, UV\u2013visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Characteristic results clearly show that the mesoporous architecture of nitrogen and Fe (III) co-doped TiO 2 is composed of mixed-phase crystal textures of anatase and brookite. And the prepared sample has a larger specific area, small crystal size and an uniform pore distribution even after calcined 400 \u00b0C. The photocatalytic activity of samples was evaluated by the photodegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol in solution under visible light irradiation. It was found that the photocatalytic activity of co-doped mesoporous TiO 2 powders was higher than that of N-doped mesoporous TiO 2 sample and P25.",

The interaction of TiO 2 nanoparticles with DDAT was investigated by infrared spectra. The XRD indicated that the modification process could not influence the crystallite phase of TiO 2.

These nanospheres exhibit multifluorescent signals under a single-wavelength excitation as a result of the solid silica core that is doped with three kinds of dyes and that can produce effective fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The fluorescent signal of a single nanosphere is about 700 times brighter than its constituent fluorophores. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and N(2) adsorption-desorption isotherms reveal that these nanospheres possess abundant mesopores in the shell. Combining the advantages of extremely bright multifluorescent signals excited with a single wavelength and an abundant mesoporous system, this core-shell silica nanosphere is designed for the simultaneous monitoring of fluorescence of in vivo multiple-target drug transport. Experiments on drug loading and release in addition to studies on cell uptake reveal that these nanospheres not only show good drug storage and sustained release capacity but also demonstrate biocompatibility and mutlifluorescent labeling capacity for biological systems.",

The intensity of the fluorescence spectrum decreases with the increase in the Ti content. A characteristic BDD excimer fluorescence was observed during the transition from gel to xerogel only in a mixture of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and tetraisopropoxy titanium (TPOT) but not in pure TEOS, indicating that the presence of a tetrahedrally coordinated titanium ion species plays a significant role in the formation of the excimer.

The photocatalytic activity of Fe-TiO2 catalysts was evaluated from the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution both under UV and visible light irradiation. Fe3+ doping effectively improves the photocatalytic activity under both UV light irradiation and visible light irradiation with an optimal doping concentration of 0.1 and 0.2%, respectively.

For comparison, another three synthesis system were adopted to form SAPO-34 by using stoichiometric equivalence of calcined SBA-15, physical mixture of calcined SBA-15 and P123, and physical mixture of colloidal silica and P123 as initial reactants, respectively. The result shows that SAPO-34 can be prepared by all of the synthesis systems, however, only the sample prepared with as-synthesized SBA-15 shows mesoporous structure as revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Compared with SAPO-34 prepared with conventional and the above three contrasting systems, the specific surface area of this sample is considerably improved due to the existence of mesoporous structure. For the application as the catalyst for methanol to olefins (MTO) reaction, the layered mesoporous SAPO-34 presents the longest single life among all of samples.",

        "abstract": "A carbon modified TiO2 (CT) was synthesized by hydrolyzing titanium tetrachloride with diethylamine and calcination at 400\u00b0C. CT was then handled with a NaOH aqueous solution elution and a subsequent re-assembling treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) were then used to assess the changes of CT during the whole process. It is revealed that carbon in the CT should mostly be presented as surface deposited organic matters but not likely doped into the TiO2 lattice. CT exhibits obvious visible absorption and high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, CT photocatalyst possesses excellent stability and reusability. NaOH solution elution washes off a large amount of surface deposited organics and worsens the visible absorbance and photocatalytic activity of CT, which can be well recovered by the re-assembling treatment. The re-assembled photocatalyst, CTSL, exhibits exhibits a very similar photocataytic activity with CT for degradation of DCP under the visible light irradiation, but is much higher than that of CTS. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Several characterization techniques, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra, were combined to determine the crystal phase, concentration and chemical states of the nitrogen doped in TiO2. The high photocatalytic activity of the nitrogen-doped TiO2 was evaluated through the decomposition of rhodanmine B under visible light irradiation. It was suggested that the doped nitrogen formed oxynitride (NO) and produced impurity states at higher above the valence band of TiO2. Therefore, the nitrogen doping could enhance the response of photocatalyst to the visible light and improve the photocatalytic activity because of the narrowing of band gap of TiO2.",

        "abstract": "A three-dimensionally macroporous\u2013mesoporous lithium ion sieve (3DM-H4Ti5O12) was transformed from 3DM-Li4Ti5O12 through washing with HCl solution, which was synthesized by a combination of hydrothermal and low-temperature calcination (600\u00a0\u00b0C) treatment, using polystyrene microarray as hard-template, and titanium isopropoxide and lithium acetate as co-precursors. The influence of HCl concentration and temperature on the deintercalation rate of Li and Ti from Li4Ti5O12 was specifically explored to maximize the extraction ratio of Li/Ti. The acceleration of Li extraction and insertion in a porous structure was verified using nonporous Li4Ti5O12 as a control. 3DM-H4Ti5O12 showed superior Li+ adsorption performance (5.51\u00a0mmol/g) compared with its nonporous counterpart (1.12\u00a0mmol/g), which was ascribed to the reduced Li+ mass transfer resistance in the highly interconnected porous channel. The ion selectivity of the 3DM-H4Ti5O12 lithium ion sieve followed the order of Li+\u00a0>\u00a0Na+\u00a0~\u00a0Ca2+\u00a0>\u00a0K+\u00a0>\u00a0Mg2+. The adsorption performance could be maintained after six cycles. The high adsorption capacity, excellent selectivity, and good recyclability demonstrate the prosperous potential application of 3DM-H4Ti5O12.",

        "abstract": "The high quality MCM-48 has been easily synthesized at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h, and the results of which showed that not only long-range ordering of MCM-48, but also hydrothermal stability could be significantly improved by direct addition of NaF with F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 and 0.2 to initial reacting gel without post-treatment and pH adjustment. The results of XRD, N 2 -adsorption and TEM analyses indicated that MCM-48, which was synthesized via appropriate procedure, maintained their structural integrity after boiling in water at 100 \u00b0C for at least 3 days. Additionally, the optimum condition was F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 at a Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio of 0.25. The adding time of NaF was critical in the formation of this high quality MCM-48. When the addition of fluoride ions was 60 min earlier than that of surfactant, the mesoporous structure of the synthesized MCM-48 could be maintained after refluxing in boiling water for 3 days. When the additions of fluoride ions and surfactant were simultaneous, however, the structure of MCM-48 was collapsed after 12 h refluxing in boiling water. The result clearly showed that the long-range structural ordering and hydrothermal stability could be improved only when adding NaF at the early stage of hydrolysis and polymerization of silicate. The different effects of fluoride anions at the different reacting periods of synthesizing MCM-48 are also discussed. Keywords Fluoride addition Hydrothermal stability MCM-48 Adding time Long-range ordering 1 Introduction A mesoporous molecular sieve, MCM-48, invented by Mobil [1,2] in 1992, has attracted considerable attention because of its high surface area, ordered pore structure array, and narrow pore size distribution. As an adsorbent, catalyst, catalyst support, and template for the synthesis of advanced nanostructures, MCM-48 may be a more potent candidate than MCM-41 and MCM-50. However, the preparation of MCM-48 requires relatively extended reaction time and more rigorous synthesis conditions, since the MCM-48 phase is often an intermediate during the transformation from a hexagonal phase or disordered surfactant/silica mesophase to a lamellar phase [3\u20139] . Especially, it is difficult to synthesize MCM-48 with good long-range ordering structure. Recently, Ryoo and Kim [10] reported that the long-range structural order and textural uniformity of MCM-41 were markedly improved by adjusting the reacting solution using acetic acid, three separate times, during the reaction. This procedure, however, is not convenient because the reacting solution has to be cooled to adjust its pH, and the synthesis reaction restarted. The same procedure must be repeated several times during the reaction. More recently, Kim et al. [11] reported that initial adjustment of pH and direct addition of NaF led to increase the long-range structural order of MCM-41. However, until now, the above reports are all focused on the MCM-41 and the method for improvement of long-range ordering of mesoporous materials is inconvenient. There is no detailed study on the enhancement of structural ordering of MCM-48 by a convenient method. The hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 has been known to be very low, and Xia and Mokaya reported that the mesoporous structure of MCM-48 was completely lost after 6 h refluxing in boiling water [12] . The loss of hydrothermal stability could be a serious barrier for the application of this material to water and aqueous solution systems. Since the applications such as exchanging cations, supporting metal clusters, and catalytic reactions in aqueous solutions will be limited by the structural disintegration, it is thus important to improve the hydrothermal stability of mesoporous framework. Many effective improvements such as pore wall thickening [13\u201316] , silylation [17\u201320] , stabilization by salt effect [21,22] and hydrothermal restructuring process [23] have been reported. Kim et al. [24] reported that the addition of salts during hydrothermal synthesis of MCM-48 resulted in a remarkable improvement of the hydrothermal stability. However, the use of salts during the hydrothermal synthesis is not convenient for MCM-48 because the formation of the MCM-48 mesophase requires narrow, specific synthesis conditions. Jun et al. [25] reported that the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 could be improved by post-synthesis restructuring in salt solution. However, the post-synthesis requires additional synthesis time. Recently, many researches have been focussing on the fluorination of MCM-48 [26,27] . Fluoride ions do influence the nature, activity and polymerizing capacity of silica precursors, and a fluorinated silica surface is much more hydrophobic and more resistant to the attack of water molecules than a silanol silica surface [28] . More recently, Kim et al. [27] also reported that the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 could be improved by post-treatment in NaF solution. A combined effect of NaF addition and hydrothermal post-treatment could maximize the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48. Therefore, it is a challenging issue to investigate effecting of adding time of NaF on the quality of synthesizing MCM-48. However, up to now, no systematic study has been reported on the possibility of synthesizing MCM-48 with high hydrothermal stability and well-defined long-range order of the structure by directly adding NaF with F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 and 0.2 to the initial reacting gel without post-treatment and pH adjustment for 24 h. The aim of this research was also to investigate the different effects of fluoride anions at the different reacting periods of synthesizing MCM-48. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The reactants used in this study were tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica source, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant, sodium hydroxyl (NaOH) as the alkali source, sodium fluoride (NaF) and deionized water. 2.2 Experimental procedures To investigate the effect of adding time of fluoride, two sets of samples via different procedures (procedure I and procedure II) were prepared. The differentiation of two procedures was the adding time of fluoride ions: the addition of fluoride ions was 60 min earlier than that of surfactant in procedure I, however, the additions of fluoride ions and surfactant were simultaneous in procedure II. 2.2.1 Procedure I The first set of samples were synthesized via procedure I, the materials of which were prepared as follows: 10 g of TEOS was mixed with 50 g of deionized water and the mixture was vigorously stirred at 35 \u00b0C for 40 min, then required amount of NaOH was added into the mixture, at the same time, the required amount of NaF was also added into the mixture. After another 60 min of vigorously stirring at 35 \u00b0C, 10.61 g of CTAB was added to the mixture and continued stirring at 35 \u00b0C for 60 min. The molar composition of the final mixture was 1.0SiO 2 :0.65CTAB:(0.22\u20130.27)Na 2 O:62H 2 O:(0\u20130.4)NaF. Finally, the mixture was heated for 24 h at 393 K in an autoclave under static condition, the resulting MCM-48 product was filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at 373 K. The as-synthesized samples were then calcined for 4 h at 550 \u00b0C, after increasing the temperature to 550 \u00b0C at 1 \u00b0C/min of heating rate. 2.2.2 Procedure II The second set of samples were also prepared as follows: the molar composition was same as the first set of samples, however, the adding time of fluoride ions was different from that in procedure I. Fluoride ions and surfactant were simultaneously added into mixture in procedure II. In the second set, 10 g of TEOS was mixed with 50 g of deionized water and the mixture was vigorously stirred at 35 \u00b0C for 40 min, then the required amount of NaOH was added into mixture. After stirring at 35 \u00b0C for about 60 min, the required amount of NaF and 10.61 g of CTAB were simultaneously added into the mixture, then continued stirring at 35 \u00b0C for 60 min. The residue procedure was same as described in procedure I. 2.3 Hydrothermal stability test 0.1 g of calcined MCM-48 was boiled for different period of time in 100 ml of distilled water, using a flask equipped with reflux condenser. XRD pattern was obtained after this boiled sample was subsequently filtered and dried in an oven at 413 K. According to the XRD analysis, loss in the XRD intensity, as compared with that of the same sample before the boiling treatment, was used to judge the hydrothermal stability. 2.4 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded on Rigaku D/MAX-2550 diffractometer using CuK\u03b1 radiation of wavelength 1.541 \u00c5, typically run at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 100 mA. N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were carried out by using Micromeritics ASAP 2010. For BET (Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller method), the as-synthesized samples were calcined following the procedures described in Section 2 and the samples were then outgassed to remove moisture and impurities at 623 K for 5 h before measurement. TEM analyses of the samples were done using a JEM 2000-EX (Jol) instrument and the electron beam accelerating voltage was 200 kV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis 3.1.1 Structural ordering of MCM-48 prepared via different procedures The quality and structural ordering of MCM-48 materials were assessed by powder XRD. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-synthesized and calcined samples prepared with directly adding different contents of NaF via procedure I and without fluoride addition at a Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio of 0.25. According to Fig. 1 (a), the patterns of the as-synthesized and calcined samples synthesized with directly adding 0.1 g of NaF, eight diffraction peaks (2 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 2 1), (4 0 0), (4 2 0), (3 3 2), (4 2 2) and (4 3 1), which can be indexed to Ia 3 d cubic structure, are clearly observed. As F \u2212 /Si ratio increases from 0.1 to 0.2, seven diffraction peaks are still well resolved on the pattern of calcined samples. However, the patterns of the samples synthesized without fluoride addition only show two basal peaks (2 1 1) and (2 2 0) and a weak peak (3 2 1), the other secondary peaks are not observed (see Fig. 1 (c)). Additionally, on the basis of Fig. 1 , the fluorination-treated samples via procedure I show the Miller indices (2 1 1) and (2 2 0) are more intense than that prepared without fluoride addition. This indicates a higher organization of the pores when fluoride ions are present. More importantly, secondary peaks are also well resolved on the patterns of the fluorination-treated samples via procedure I. The secondary peaks indicate long-range ordering of MCM-48 structure [11] . Both of these observations are indicative of improved structural ordering within the mesoporous silicas. However, the samples prepared without fluoride addition have poor structural ordering and lower degree of organization (weak intensity I 211 of the (2 1 1) peak), which is compared with the samples synthesized by adding fluoride anions with F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 and 0.2. The similar results, which on directly adding fluoride ions with F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 and 0.2 to the initial reacting gel via procedure I has significantly enhanced the long-range structural ordering, can also be obtained when varying the Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratios to 0.22 and 0.27 (seen in Fig. 2 (a) and (b)). As can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2 , directly adding fluoride ions with F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 to the initial reacting gel via procedure I has greatly improved the long-range structural ordering under different Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratios. In order to investigate the effects of fluoride anions on the formation of MCM-48 at the different periods of synthesis, the different adding time of NaF to the initial reacting gel was studied. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the calcined samples synthesized by adding different amounts of NaF via different procedures. For samples prepared via procedure I, eight diffraction peaks are clearly observed. However, the samples prepared via procedure II exhibit only two basal peaks (2 1 1) and (2 2 0), the other secondary peaks are not well resolved. On the basis of Fig. 3 , MCM-48 prepared via procedure I has a well-defined pore ordering. However, the samples synthesized via procedure II have poor structural ordering. At the same time, according to Fig. 3 , the intensity of basal peak (2 1 1) of samples synthesized via procedure I is about three times higher than that of samples prepared via procedure II. The result indicates that the direct addition of NaF with F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 and 0.2 to the reacting gel via procedure I can greatly improve the quality of MCM-48 compared with MCM-48 prepared via procedure II. Further experiments were carried out to investigate the structural ordering of mesoporous materials synthesized at different Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratios and F \u2212 /Si ratios via different procedures. As Table 1 shows for procedure I, for gels with F \u2212 /Si ratios more than 0.3, no precipitates were obtained at a Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio of 0.22; for F \u2212 /Si ratios greater than 0.2, also no solid product was formed at a Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio of 0.25; When Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio was 0.27, only the solid product of F \u2212 /Si ratios more than 0.1 disappeared. However, for procedure II, under the same conditions, all the solid products could be obtained when Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio was 0.22, 0.25, 0.27, and F \u2212 /Si ratios were corresponding to 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, respectively. These results can be explained as follows: according to Voegtlin et al. [29] , the degree of polymerization of silicates can be enhanced in the presence of fluoride ions. Enhancement of the degree of polymerization of silicates causes a high charge density of silicate network to improve the interactions between the cationic micelles and the anionic framework. The pore ordering can be enhanced in the presence of NaF. In addition, for procedure I, F \u2212 was added at the early stage of hydrolysis and condensation of silicate, so F \u2212 anions were mainly direct effect on silicate, F \u2212 anions probably play a catalytic role favoring the polymerization of the silicate species [29] . Under these conditions, the enhancement of the degree of polymerization of silicates leads to a high charge density, which improve the interactions between the cationic micelles and the anionic framework. The high degree of organization (strong intensity of the (2 1 1) peak) observed for the samples prepared via procedure I can be related to stronger interactions between the cationic micelles and the anionic framework. However, for procedure II, which by adding fluoride anions after 60 min of polymerization of silicate and meanwhile addition of CTAB, the F \u2212 anions mainly affect on the CTA + but not the silicate species. There is a competition between Br \u2212 and F \u2212 for CTA + [30] . Therefore, balancing the charges of CTA + is the main effect of fluoride anions for procedure II. Compared with the intrinsic charge density of the framework of the samples prepared via procedure I to that of the samples prepared via procedure II is much lower which is supposed to be responsible for the lower degree of organization of the samples synthesized via procedure II than that of the samples prepared via procedure I (less intense of (2 1 1) peak for the samples prepared via procedure II). On the other hand, according to Larry Kevan and coworkers [6] , the effect of different initial pH on the synthesis can be explained since lower pH speeds up the kinetics of silica polymerization. However, when Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio is greater than 0.27 at 373 K, silica dissolves faster than silica precipitates at 373 K, so no solid product is formed. In this investigation, the precipitates disappeared when Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio was only 0.25 and F \u2212 /Si ratios were greater than 0.2, which can be explained as the above reason, because of the similarity of nature between OH \u2212 and F \u2212 , F \u2212 anion has similar effect on the formation of MCM-48, fluoride ions addition can speed up the kinetics of silica polymerization at a certain Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio, however, at high Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratios with low content of fluoride anions or at high content of fluoride anions with low Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratios, for instance, at Na 2 O/SiO 2 = 0.27 and F \u2212 /Si \u2a7e 0.2, Na 2 O/SiO 2 = 0.25 and F \u2212 /Si \u2a7e 0.3, Na 2 O/SiO 2 = 0.22 and F \u2212 /Si \u2a7e 0.4, the combined effect of OH \u2212 and F \u2212 can speed up the dissolution of silicate. Therefore, for procedure I, when Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio was 0.25, for F \u2212 /Si ratios greater than 0.2, the silicates dissolve faster than precipitate, so no solid product is formed. The other results can also be explained as the same reason. However, for procedure II, the solid product was still obtained at a Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio of 0.25 and F \u2212 /Si ratio greater than 0.3. This result also can explained by the previous reason, however, for procedure II, only part of F \u2212 anions added can be efficiently effect on the silicate to cause the polymerization and hydrolysis of silicate. These results further indicate that the effect of fluoride is significantly different at different periods of synthesis of MCM-48. 3.1.2 Hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 synthesized via different procedures Fig. 4 displays the XRD patterns of materials prepared via procedure I and procedure II, respectively, which was treated in boiling water at different time. As can be seen in Fig. 4 (b), the structure of the calcined samples synthesized via procedure II at F \u2212 /Si = 0.07 is completely collapsed after refluxing in boiling water for 12 h. For procedure II, as F \u2212 /Si ratio increases to 0.1 and 0.2 (see Fig. 4 (d) and (f)), the MCM-48 also loses its mesoporous structure completely upon boiling in water for 12 h. However, two sharp and distinct characteristic XRD peaks of (2 1 1) and (2 2 0) are still observed for materials synthesized at F \u2212 /Si = 0.07 via procedure I (see Fig. 4 (a)), even after treatment in boiling water for 2 days, showing that the materials treated are still typical for cubic MCM-48, but the intensity of XRD peaks decreases with the extending treatment time. For procedure I, as F \u2212 /Si ratio increases to 0.1 (see Fig. 4 (c)), its cubic structure still can be maintained after refluxing in boiling water for 3 days, but as F \u2212 /Si ratio added to the reacting gel via procedure I increases to 0.2 (see Fig. 4 (e)), the cubic structure is almost lost after refluxing in boiling water for 3 days. According to Fig. 4 , the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48, which was synthesized via procedure I, increases with F \u2212 /Si ratio increasing from 0.07 to 0.1 and decreases with increasing F \u2212 /Si ratio from 0.1 to 0.2. The optimum condition was F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1. The hydrothermal stability is significantly different between samples prepared via procedure I and procedure II under the same content of addition of NaF (0.07, 0.1, 0.2) and refluxing conditions. The hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 synthesized via procedure I is significantly higher than that prepared via procedure II, the mesoporous structure of the former can be maintained after refluxing in boiling water for 3 days, however, the mesoporous structure of the latter is collapsed after refluxing in boiling water for 12 h. According to the experimental procedure, which is the difference between procedure I and procedure II, is only the adding time of NaF. Procedure I is addition of fluoride at the early stage of hydrolysis and condensation of silicate. However, procedure II is addition of fluoride after 60 min hydrolysis and polymerization of silicates, where CTAB should be added immediately to the reaction mixture. The different hydrothermal stability might be attributed to the different effects of F \u2212 in the reacting gel. For procedure I, F \u2212 anions mainly directly affect on the silicate to improve the degree of polymerization of silicate framework and also replace the silanol group to form very stable Si\u2013F; for procedure II, however, F \u2212 anions mainly affect on the CTA + as the counterion to balance the charge of CTA + . Having achieved a certain degree of polymerization, only part of F \u2212 anions is efficiently effective on the silicate. Therefore it is not effective to catalyze the condensation of silicate and replace the silanol group. Therefore, the hydrothermal stability of samples prepared via procedure I is significantly higher than that of the samples synthesized via procedure II, the mesoporous structure of the former can be maintained after refluxing in boiling water for 3 days, however, the mesoporous structure of the latter is collapsed after refluxing in boiling water for 12 h. In order to further prove the previous explanation, further investigation was carried out. According to Table 2 , one significant difference between the uncalcined MCM-48 obtained via procedure I and procedure II is that the extent of the unit cell shrinkage during calcination. Table 2 shows that the samples synthesized via procedure I show much less shrinkage upon calcination. For example, the shrinkage of a 0 is 11% for the sample synthesized at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h and a F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 via procedure II and 11.3% for the sample prepared without fluoride addition, while the shrinkage of a 0 is only 1.2% for the sample synthesized via procedure I. The less shrinkage of the unit cell for the samples synthesized via procedure I with adding NaF with F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 and 0.2 is as a result of better wall polymerization. This result indicates that fluoride addition via procedure I really remarkably improves the polymerization of silicate. However, the degree of polymerization of silicate has not been distinctly enhanced via procedure II. Therefore, fluoride anions directly affect on the silicate via procedure I, however, fluoride ions hardly efficiently affect on silicate to improve the polymerization of silicate via procedure II. The shrinkage of a 0 is 6.6% at a F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.2 is higher than 1.2% at a F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1. The former degree of polymerization of silicate is lower than that of the latter, which can be used to explain the reason that the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48, which was synthesized via procedure I, decreases with increasing the F \u2212 /Si ratio from 0.1 to 0.2. 3.2 N 2 -adsorption analysis Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherms enable the calculation of the specific surface area, pore volume, and mesopore size distribution. N 2 adsorption isotherms for the calcined MCM-48 materials synthesized with adding different contents of NaF via procedure I are shown in Fig. 5 , which are typical type IV adsorption isotherms. Both of the figures show a sharp inflection between relative pressure P / P 0 = 0.2 and 0.3 corresponding to capillary condensation within uniform mesopores. The sharpness of this step reflects the uniform pore size. Also, the initial region can be extrapolated back to the origin, confirming the absence of any detectable micropore filling at low P / P 0 ( P / P 0 < 0.3). Therefore, the very uniform mesopore systems without micropore structure are observed in the calcined materials. The BJH plots of the derivative of the pore volume per unit weight with respect to the pore diameter versus the pore volume are shown in the inserted graphs in Fig. 5 . Two very narrow pore size distributions with the average pore diameter of 2.6 nm and 2.58 nm are observed, respectively. The BET surface areas were 1323.0738 m 2 /g and 1169.8458 m 2 /g, respectively. The BET surface area and pore diameter of MCM-48 prepared at F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 is larger than that synthesized at F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.2. 3.3 TEM analysis In order to investigate the pore structure of MCM-48 synthesized with adding NaF via procedure I, TEM of the calcined-sample was obtained and shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 (a) is a TEM images of MCM-48 particle which show a well-defined edge and a spherical shape. High-resolution TEM images for the selected particle along the [1 0 0], [1 1 1], and [1 1 0] directions ( Fig. 6 (b)\u2013(d)) match well with the reported MCM-48 images [31\u201334] . Along the [1 0 0] direction the TEM ( Fig. 6 (b)) shows uniform pore structures, while along the [1 1 1] direction ( Fig. 6 (c)) the image shows a well-defined hexagonal arrangement. Along the [1 1 0] direction ( Fig. 6 (d)) a very regular pattern without irregularities is observed. Along the [1 0 0] and [1 1 1] directions channels are observed. The [1 0 0] and [1 1 1] projections reflect the actual shape and structure of the channels, while the regularity of the TEM image in the [1 1 0] direction in Fig. 6 (d) indicates a uniform channel system. The cubic unit parameter a can be directly measured as about 87 \u00c5 from the hexagonal patterns [31,32] along the [1 1 1] direction in Fig. 6 (c). This is consistent with the XRD results. 4 Conclusions It is concluded that the high hydrothermal stable MCM-48, the mesoporous structure of which can be maintained after refluxing in boiling water for at least 3 days, with well-defined long-range order of the structure was easily synthesized at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h by direct addition of NaF with F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 and 0.2 to the initial reacting gel via appropriate procedure without post-treatment and pH adjustment. The results of XRD, N 2 -adsorption and TEM analyses clearly support it. The directly adding of NaF with F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.07, 0.1 and 0.2 to the reacting gel via appropriate procedure could lead to high hydrothermally stable MCM-48, which could maintain their structural integrity after boiling in water at 100 \u00b0C for at least 3 days. Additionally, the optimum condition was F \u2212 /Si ratio of 0.1 at a Na 2 O/SiO 2 ratio of 0.25. The adding time of NaF is critical in the formation of this high quality MCM-48. The different results would be obtained via different synthesis procedures. The hydrothermal stability and the mesoscopic structure of the samples prepared via procedure I were significantly higher than that of the samples synthesized via procedure II, the mesoporous structure of the former could be maintained after refluxing in boiling water for 3 days, while for the latter, the structure was collapsed after 12 h refluxing in boiling water, additionally, the structural ordering of the former was higher than that of the latter. Further study indicated that the different effects of fluoride anions were caused at the different reacting periods of synthesizing MCM-48. The long-range structural ordering and hydrothermal stability can be improved only when adding NaF at the early stage of hydrolysis and polymerization of silicate.

        "abstract": "A mesoporous TiO 2 with high photocatalytic activity was synthesized by assembling nanocrystalline particles using dodecylamine (DDA) as organic linkers. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). Low-angle XRD and TEM confirmed that the mesoporous TiO 2 had a wormhole-like structure. Nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm showed products retained mesoporosity with a narrow pore size distribution (2.8\u20134.0 nm) and high surface areas (104.4\u2013346.0 m 2 /g) to 673 K. TG-DTA analysis revealed that the surfactant had been removed partly in as-synthesized samples. The pH value affected the order of mesoporous structure. The ordered mesoporous structure would not retain at pH = 14. All calcined mesoporous TiO 2 showed high photocatalytic activities on photodecomposition of cationic dye X-GL. Keywords Mesoporous TiO 2 Organic linkers Assembly Nanocrystalline particle Photocatalytic activity 1 Introduction The successful combination of sol\u2013gel and self-assembly in the synthesis of ordered mesoporous silica has attracted much attention to extend the surfactant-templating process to fabricate mesoporous transition metal oxides since these materials display very interesting function in the field of catalysis [1,2] . Among these transition metal oxides, TiO 2 has been proven to be the most suitable phototcatalyst [3\u20136] because of its strong oxidizing power, low cost and long-term stability against photocorrosion and chemical corrosion. Until 1995, mesoporous TiO 2 with a large surface area was first synthesized by a modified sol\u2013gel method with phosphorus surfactants as templates by Antonelli and Ying [7] , which opened a new outlook in the synthesis of mesoporous TiO 2 . From then on, many investigations have been carried out in this field [8\u201314] . Recently, a novel and efficacious method called evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) was reported, which can fabricate 2D-hexagonal mesoporous TiO 2 effectively [15] . However, two indispensable problems should be resolved in order to obtain mesoporous TiO 2 with high photocatalytic activity. On the one hand, mesoporous TiO 2 synthesized by conventional approaches using surfactants as templates has poor photocatalytic activity because the surfactant is bound very tightly to the mesoporous TiO 2 as a result of which the surfactants could not be removed entirely, by either calcination below the crystallization temperature of anatase or solvent extraction [7,16,17] . On the other hand, mesoporous TiO 2 that has been calcined below the crystallization temperature of anatase or extracted by solvent to remove the template often has amorphous or semicrystalline structure resulting in negligible photocatalytic activity. Calcination above the crystallization temperature of anatase is quite necessary to getting crystalline TiO 2 . However, the crystallization for mesoporous TiO 2 takes place at high temperature (723\u2013823 K) and always accompanies the total collapse of mesoporous structure due to extensive growth of nanocrystals. Anatase has higher photocatalytic activity than amorphous, so it is a challenge to synthesize anatase mesoporous TiO 2 with high photocatalytic activity. In the present work, nanocrystalline particles were prepared at low temperature in presence of nitric acid by sol\u2013gel method at first. Then nanocrystalline particles were used as the assembly units to prepare mesoporous TiO 2 using dedocylamine as organic linkers. In this method, the surfactant in mesoporous TiO 2 was removed easily. The calcined samples had higher photocatalytic activities than the commercial photocatalyst P25 due to the removal of surfactant and crystalline frameworks. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The chosen titanium precursor was tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 , CP grade). Ethanol and nitric acid were all AR grade. Dedocylamine was CP grade. 2.2 Methods Mesoporous TiO 2 with anatase framework was synthesized by assembling nanocrystalline particles. The first step was the synthesis of nanocrystalline particles. Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 (5 ml, 0.0147 mol) was added to an aqueous solution of HNO 3 (0.0147 mol) dropwise slowly under vigorous stirring at 313 K to get a transparent solution. The hydrolysis products were two layers of solution, the upper layer was an organics and the bottom layer was a transparent sol [18] . The second step was the synthesis of mesoporous TiO 2 . The transparent sol was separated from the organics and aged at ambient temperature for 3 h before an ethanol solution of dodecylamine (0.0147 mol) was added under vigorous stirring. In order to investigate the effect of pH values on the mesoporous structure, the different pH values of the ethanol solutions of dodecylamine were adjusted by 1.8 mol/l KOH. The reaction product was a transparent sol, which was then treated with or without ultrasonic before aged at 353 K for 24 h in a closed flask. Ultrasonic treatment was operated on SK1200H Ultrasonic Instrument (59 kHz, 45 W). The resulting white gel was transferred to a Petri dish and dried at 353 K for another 24 h to give a yellow powder. The yellow powder was rinsed with absolute ethanol (3 \u00d7 20 ml) and subsequently dried at 353 K overnight. The products were calcined from 523 K to 673 K. The samples prepared in different conditions were notated as Ti- n -(U)( m ). Here, n represents the pH value, U represents ultrasonic treatment, m represents different calcination conditions. For example, Ti-10-U1 represents that the sample had been treated with ultrasonic treatment in the synthesis process, and was calcined at 523 K. The synthesis conditions are summarized in Table 1 in detail. 2.3 Characterization Low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were collected in \u03b8 \u20132 \u03b8 mode using Rigaku D/MAX-2550 apparatus (Cu K\u03b1 1 radiation, \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5), operated at 40 kV and 200 mA. Wide-angle XRD diagrams were collected in the same mode, but operated at 100 mA. The sample was observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a JEM-1200EX II (JEOL, Ltd.) apparatus at 120 kV and under high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in a 2100 JEOL apparatus at 200 kV. Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was conducted in air at a heating rate of 10 K/min from 323 K to 873 K on a TGA/SDTA DSC851e instrument. The porous textures of the samples were analyzed using nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms at 77 K. By using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 system, the BET and BJH methods were applied for the determination of the specific surface area, and the mean mesoporous equivalent diameter, respectively. Before measurement, samples were evacuated at 473 K. 2.4 Measurement of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activities of mesoporous TiO 2 prepared here were measured by photodecomposition of cationic dye X-GL in aqueous solution at ambient temperature. The formula of X-GL is shown in Scheme 1 . X-GL was selected because of its well-defined optical absorption characteristic. A sample of 0.0500 g was ultrasonic dispersed in 50 ml X-GL aqueous solution with a concentration of 40 mg/l. Stirring in dark for 35 min ensured that it reached absorbance balance on its surface. The solution was then irradiated with a UV source (300 W, 254\u2013600 nm, \u03bb max at 365 nm). The distance between the light source and the reaction tube was 23.5 cm. The photodecomposition proportions of X-GL aqueous solution were calculated by detecting the decrease in the absorbance. The absorbance of solutions was measured by a Cary 100 UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer at 438 nm after 60 min. Absorbance of X-GL has a linear relationship with its concentration in the range from 0 mg/l to 60 mg/l. X-GL was not photodegraded in the absence of any catalyst under the irradiation conditions or in the presence of a photocatalyst without irradiation. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Synthetic approach The synthesis method was designed to resolve two important issues in synthesis of mesoporous TiO 2 with high photocatalytic activity: (a) the difficulty of entirely removing the surfactant, (b) poor photocatalytic activity of amorphous or semicrystalline mesoporous TiO 2 . An acid environment promoted hydrolysis rate and at the same time decreased the condensation rate [18] . Nanocrystalline particles were first obtained by hydrolysis of precursor in HNO 3 solution at the molar ratio of HNO 3 /Ti = 1. As a result, anatase particles with small crystallite size and high dispersity could be obtained, which made it possible that they were used as assembly units to synthesize anatase mesoporous TiO 2 . Dodecylamine was chosen as the organic linkers because of its simplicity, the solubility difference between the amphilic domains, and the weak interaction with the inorganic precursor. This was one of the primary factors to synthesize mesoporous TiO 2 with high photocatalytic activity because the surfactant could be removed easily. Based on these facts, mesoporous TiO 2 with high photocatalytic activity could be obtained. 3.2 Characterization of assembly units Titania exists in three polymorphs in nature: anatase, rutile and brookite. Each structure exhibits different physical properties and has different applications. Anatase has large band gap energy and suitable redox potentials for practical use in photocatalysis and photoelectronics. Under ambient conditions, macrocrystalline rutile is thermodynamically stable relative to macrocrystalline anatase and brookite. However, thermodynamic stability is particle-size dependent and at particle diameters below ca. 11 nm, anatase is more stable than rutile, and when particle diameters are between 11 nm and 35 nm, brookite is the most stable [19] . In this study, the wide-angle X-ray diffraction was used to investigate the phase of as-synthesized assembly units, seen in Fig. 1 . The characteristic peaks of anatase appeared in this wide-angle XRD patterns, which testified that the as-synthesized assembly units were anatase. From the wide-angle XRD patterns, the size of the assembly unit was 2.5 nm, which was calculated by applying the Scherrer formula on the anatase (1 0 1) diffraction peak. 3.3 The properties of samples The mesoporous structure and the nature of channel walls of the as-synthesized mesoporous TiO 2 were characterized by TEM and HRTEM. Fig. 2 (a) was the TEM image of Ti-10-U, which showed that the sample had wormhole-like mesoporous structure. Furthermore, the corresponding HRTEM image of Ti-10-U ( Fig. 2 (b)) evidenced the presence of many nanocrystalline particles showing lattice fringes of anatase (1 0 1), indicating that these nanocrystalline particles were connected with each other to form a crystalline framework. As shown in Fig. 3 , one broad peak appeared either in low-angle XRD pattern of Ti-10-U or in the pattern of Ti-12-U, which was attributed to their ordered mesoporous structures. In low-angle XRD patterns of mesoporous silica HMS [20] with wormhole framework, only one broad peak could be observed, which was similar to that of our sample. So the samples were not layered structures but wormhole framework structures. However, DDA was not used as templates with the formation of micelle but as linkers to assemble the nanocrystalline particles in this method. Although, in previous reports [14] , the low-angle XRD peak of the mesoporous TiO 2 synthesized with dedocylamine appeared at around 2 \u03b8 = 2.7\u00b0, the peaks of samples Ti-12-U and Ti-10-U were at about 2 \u03b8 = 2.018\u00b0 and 2 \u03b8 = 1.496\u00b0 respectively, indicating that the d -spaces of our samples were larger. In order to study the effect of pH value on the synthesis of mesoporous TiO 2 , a series of pH values (pH = 10, 12, 14) were adopted to synthesize three different samples (Ti-10-U, Ti-12-U, Ti-14-U). From Fig. 3 , the XRD peak location and intensity of Ti-10-U were both different from those of Ti-12-U, while Ti-14-U did not show any peak in low-angle XRD pattern. This confirmed that Ti-10-U and Ti-12-U had ordered mesoporous structures and Ti-14-U did not display any ordered structure. Consequently, the pH value was considered as a significant effect on mesoporous structure in this synthetic method. The condensation of the assembly units (nanocrystalline particles) might be fast and the sizes of particles increased with the increase of pH value, which resulted in the decrease of the interactions between nanocrystalline particles and surfactants, and the disappearance of mesoporous structure. To characterize the mesoporous structures of the products synthesized either in the absence or presence of ultrasonic treatment, low-angle XRD pattern of Ti-10-U synthesized with ultrasonic treatment and Ti-10 synthesized without ultrasonic treatment were obtained, as shown in Fig. 3 . From these patterns, the mesoporous order of the product was enhanced by ultrasonic treatment. It could be explained that the sizes of nanocrystalline particles would decrease and the dispersity of particles would increase due to ultrasonic treatment. Consequently, the interactions between particles and surfactants would increase, which leading to the increase of the mesoporosity of the product. Actually, calcined samples Ti-10-U1, Ti-10-U2, Ti-12-U1 and Ti-12-U2 did not show any peak in low-angle XRD patterns, which testified that these samples did not have ordered mesoporous structures. Fig. 1 showed the crystal phase of the samples. The as-synthesized samples, except Ti-10, showed the characteristic peaks of anatase and brookite in wide-angle XRD patterns. The formation mechanism of brookite was not well understood. Usually, the alkali ions play a significant role for nucleation of the brookite phase [21] and ultrasonic treatment may assist the formation of brookite [10] . In this study, the pH value was adjusted using 1.8 mol/l KOH. The existence of brookite in our samples was the result of the presence of potassium ion (K + ) and ultrasonic treatment. The phase contents of the samples were calculated from the integrated intensities of anatase (1 0 1) and brookite (1 2 1) peaks with the following formulas according to Zhang and Banfield [19] . (1) W A = k A A A / ( k A A A + A R + k B A B ) (2) W R = A R / ( k A A A + A R + k B A B ) (3) W B = k B A B / ( k A A A + A R + k B A B ) In Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) , W A , W R and W B represent the weight fractions of anatase, rutile and brookite, respectively. A A , A R and A B are the integrated intensities of anatase (1 0 1), rutile (1 1 0) and brookite (1 2 1) peaks, respectively. The variables k A and k B are two coefficients ( k A = 0.886 and k B = 2.721) [19] .The calculated phase contents of anatase and brookite are shown in Table 2 . The brookite contents of the samples calcined at 523 K were same as that of the as-synthesized samples, while the contents of the samples calcined at 673 K were less than that of as-synthesized samples. However, the brookite contents of samples increased with the increase of pH value. The nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution plots are shown in Fig. 4 . All samples displayed type IV isotherms with H2 hysteresis loops, which were related to the mesoporous structure. H2 hysteresis loops are observed for materials with relatively uniform channel-like pores, when the desorption branch happens to be located at relative pressure around P / P 0 = 0.4 [22] . The desorption branches of Ti-10-U, Ti-10-U1, Ti-12-U and Ti-12-U1 happened at about the relative pressure P / P 0 = 0.45, indicating that these samples had uniform channel-like mesopores. Although, calcined samples did not show any peaks in the low-angle XRD patterns, these samples had the type IV isotherms with H2 hysteresis loops, which testified that these samples had disordered mesoporous structures. Similarly, Ti-14-U had low-ordered mesoporous structure because this sample did not show any XRD peak in the low-angle XRD patterns but showed the type IV isotherms with H2 hysteresis loops. So the order of mesoporous structure would decrease with the increase of pH values. The porosities, from the saturation adsorption volume of nitrogen (standard temperature and pressure or STP) obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm, were calculated by the formulas [23] . (4) P = V p / ( V p + 0.27 ) (5) V p = 1.547 \u00d7 10 - 3 V d where V p is the volume of liquidated nitrogen corresponding to the total pore volume, which was calculated from the saturation adsorption volume ( V d ) in STP. The BET surface areas, pore sizes, pore volumes and porosities of samples are summarized in Table 2 . After calcination, the BET surface areas of the samples decreased a lot. But the change of porosities maintained at 673 K, meant that the BET surface area was mainly influenced by the growth of particles [23] . From Table 2 , the porosity decreased with the increase of pH value, which also testified the fact that increasing pH value would do harm to the mesoporous structure. TG-DTA results of the Ti-12-U are illustrated in Fig. 5 . As can be seen from the TG curve, there were two regions of weight loss, associated with one endothermic and one exothermic DTA peak. The first weight loss of ca. 12.7% in the range of 323\u2013461 K, where there was an evident endothermic peak, was attributed to the loss of ethanol and adsorbed water. Between 473 K and 673 K, the second weight loss of about 9.2% corresponded to the removal of a residual organic surfactant, which was associated with one exothermic DTA peak. The condensation of hydroxyl groups linked to titanium caused about 2% weight loss above 673 K [24,25] . The total weight loss above 473 K was only about 11.2%, which testified that organic surfactant had been removed mostly by washing. 3.4 Photocatalytic activities of the samples The photocatalytic activities of the different samples were investigated by detecting the decomposition proportions of X-GL aqueous solutions under UV-light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of commercial photocatalyst P25 was measured under identical conditions for comparison. The results are shown in Fig. 6 . The as-synthesized samples had larger surface areas, but all showed poor photocatalytic activities. After UV-light irradiated for 60 min, the decomposition proportion of Ti-12-U just reached 32.56% and Ti-14-U reached 49.9%, while the decomposition rate of Ti-10-U just reached 22.63%. The reason for their poor photocatalytic activities was that there was some residual surfactant in samples, resulting in loss of active sites. The photocatalytic activities of samples calcined at 523 K were higher than as-synthesized samples. Since the anatase contents and the brookite contents in these samples changed a little and surfactants were mostly removed, seen from TG-DTA curve, the reason for the significant increase of their photocatalytic activities was the increase of active sites in these samples. However, the photocatalytic activity of Ti-14-U1 was only 69.35%. This might be caused by its small BET surface area and low porosity. Furthermore, Ti-12-U1 showed higher photocatalytic activity than commercial photocatalyst P25. The photocatalyst containing 20% brookite and 80% anatase had higher photocatalytic activity than a commercial photocatalyst containing 20% rutile and 80% anatase [26] . Therefore, high photocatalytic activity of Ti-12-U1 could be attributed to its larger BET surface area and mixed crystal containing 21.5% brookite and 78.5% anatase. Although the BET areas of Ti-10-U2, Ti-12-U2 and Ti-14-U2 decreased a lot after calcined at 673 K, surfactants in these samples were removed completely at this temperature. So these samples also had high photocatalytic activities. 4 Conclusions Mesoporous TiO 2 (Ti-10-U and Ti-12-U) with crystalline framework was successfully synthesized by assembling nanocrystalline particles. The effect of pH value on mesoporous structure was investigated. The mesoporous order would decrease with the increase of pH value and the ordered mesoporous TiO 2 could not be synthesized at pH = 14. Moreover, the ultrasonic treatment was able to improve the order of mesoporous TiO 2 in this synthetic method. But the thermal stabilities of samples were poor and calcined samples just had disordered mesoporous. Due to the existence of brookite, the removal of surfactant and the mesoporous structure, all calcined samples showed high photocatalytic activities. Ti-10-U2, Ti-12-U1 and Ti-12-U2 showed higher photocatalytic activities than P25 for their high surface area, small grain size, and the facile diffusion of reactants to active sites in the wormhole-like mesoporous. After UV-light irradiated for 60 min, the decomposition proportions of Ti-10-U2, Ti-12-U1 and Ti-12-U2 reached 99.13%, 99.54%, 96.70% respectively.

The reaction time reduces with the increasing F \u2212 / Si ratio, but the high ratio of 0.4 will only lead to a disordered structure with poor crystallinity. The pore ordering is also considerably improved with the aid of fluoride ions even the reaction time is much shorter than those without any fluorides. The time-reduction action of fluoride ions on the synthesis of MCM-48 is attributed to the accelerated hydrolysis speed of silica source and condensation degree of silicates by fluoride ions.

The ordered mesoporous TiO 2 (M-TiO 2 ) was loaded with different % of Bi 2 O 3 using the wet impregnation method. For comparison Degussa P25 impregnated with Bi 2 O 3 was also prepared. The samples were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra (PLS), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption (BET) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. XRD and Raman spectra showed the pore wall was composed of anatase. 1.0% Bi 2 O 3 loaded M-TiO 2 revealed the well-ordered mesostructure. UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements showed an extension of light absorption into the visible region. PLS analysis indicated that the electron\u2013hole recombination rate have been effectively inhibited when Bi 2 O 3 was loaded with ordered M-TiO 2 . The photo oxidation efficiency was evaluated by methyl orange (MO) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation under visible illumination. The samples loaded with different % of Bi 2 O 3 showed higher photocatalytic activity than M-TiO 2 and Bi 2 O 3 loaded P25. The catalyst exhibited high activity due to the Bi 2 O 3 -photosensitization and well-ordered 2D pore structure. The ordered mesoporous channels facilitate mass transport of the organic pollutants. TiO 2 could extend the spectral response from UV to visible region because of Bi 2 O 3 -photosensitization which make the Bi 2 O 3 loaded M-TiO 2 photocatalyst visible light responsive.",

        "abstract": "A series of uniform and transparent Fe-doped TiO2 films were prepared by autoclaved-sol method at low temperature. The as-prepared films were characterized by XRD, DRS, EPR and AFM. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated based on the degradation of Rhodamine B solution under visible light. It was found that all the films were composed of mixed-phase crystal of anatase and brookite. Fe3+ ions have been successfully doped into the TiO2 crystal lattice by substituting Ti4+, thus inducing significant absorption shift toward visible region compared with the pure TiO2 films. EPR result further illustrated the doped Fe ions entered into the TiO2 lattice. AFM reveals that doping of Fe ions increases the mean roughness and secondary particle size. The 0.5% Fe-TiO2 films demonstrated the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light due to the interaction of active sites, impurity energy level and contact surface area. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption methods. Benefiting from the short residence time and high quenching rate during the flame spray process, V 4+ ions are successfully incorporated into the crystal lattice of TiO 2 . It reveals that V doping favors the primary particle size growth as well as the increase of rutile content in the products. The photocatalytic activity of the V\u2013TiO 2 samples under UV and visible light irradiation were evaluate by the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), respectively. It was found that V doping enhances the photocalytic activity under both UV and visible light irradiation. Especially, under visible light irradiation, the degradation rate of 2,4-dichlorophenol over 1%V\u2013TiO 2 is two times higher than that over undoped TiO 2 . The photocatalytic mechanisms for V\u2013TiO 2 samples under UV and visible light irradiation were tentatively discussed.",

La doping of the TiO2 nanocrystals was achieved by introducing La3+ into the hydrothermal media. The hydrothermal transition of KTO to TiO2 was investigated under various conditions, finding that the pH of the hydrothermal media, the temperature, and the pre-treating procedure play important roles in the phase transition. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the crystal phase and morphology of the samples and the transition process of the hydrothermal reaction. The content of La3+ in the samples was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the La-doped TiO2 (LaT) was measured under UV light with the degradation of methyl orange (MO, 10 mg/L). The results showed that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 was enhanced remarkably by La-doping. LaT hydrothermally prepared with 0.15 mol/L La3+ at under 180\u00b0C showed the optimal reaction constant of 0.11 min-1 for the degradation of MO, about 9.20 and 3.69 times than those of bare TiO2 and P25, respectively.",

The characteristic results clearly show that crystallization rate of the mesoporous titania affects the stability of the mesoporous structure after reflux, and that the anatase crystal in the mesoporous wall of mesoporous titania can stabilize the mesoporous structure.

        "title": "Synthesis of thermally stable and highly ordered bicontinuous cubic mesoporous titania\u2013silica binary oxides with crystalline framework",
        "abstract": "Highly ordered bicontinuous cubic mesoporous titania\u2013silica binary oxides were synthesized via evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), BET surface area and BJH pore-size distribution have been used to determine the mesostructrues and properties of the samples. The resultant materials are thermally stable (up to 600 \u00b0C), and show high surface areas (110\u2013234 m 2 /g), uniform pore diameters (\u223c3.3 nm). And the pore wall framework is composed of anatase and minor rutile phases. The effects of acidity, water content in sol and heat treatment temperature on the formation and thermal stability of mesoporous structures were investigated. Photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under UV light irradiation shows that the sample has a comparable photocatalytic activity with Degussa P25, and higher activity than pure TiO 2 . Keywords Mesoporous Titania Silica Thermal stability Photocatalyst 1 Introduction Since the MCM type mesostructured silica was first fabricated in the early 1990s [1] , series of non-siliceous mesoporous materials have been synthesized. Among them, mesoporous titania as one of the most promising photocatalysts has attracted intense interest for its advantages such as high efficiency, availability and nontoxicity [2\u20134] . In 1995, Antonelli and Ying [5] synthesized mesoporous titania for the first time. From then on, many attempts have been made to synthesize nanocrytalline mesoporous titania [6\u20138] . However, it is still much more difficult to prepare highly ordered nanocrystalline mesoporous titania with highly thermal stability. Evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method [9] is an efficient method for preparing highly ordered mesoporous titania, which was first extended to prepare non-siliceous mesoporous materials by Yang et al. [10,11] . However, the crystallinity of the mesoporous titania framework was usually not satisfied, and high temperature treatment often lead to the collapse of ordered mesostructure. An enormous difficulty in successfully synthesizing ordered crystalline titania mesostructures is the thermal stability of the inorganic network upon removal of the template [12] . Titania mesostructures have such poor thermal stability that the calcination of mesoporous titania often results in either poorly ordered materials or fully collapsed structures. The collapse is believed to be caused by the intrinsical crystallization of amorphous TiO 2 into anatase phase and crystal growth during calcinations [13,14] . In most cases, the mesostructures collapse and the porosity is destroyed mostly after being calcined above 400 \u00b0C. Many efforts have been made to improve their thermal stabilities [15\u201318] . A widespread route to resolve the stability problem of mesoporous titania is to incorporate another inorganic oxide such as SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , P 2 O 5 , ZrO 2 , WO 3 [19] into the mesostructured TiO 2 frameworks. Yang and co-workers [10,11] synthesized many ordered mesoporous metal oxides such as TiO 2 , ZrO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 using block copolymer surfactants. Although they also claimed that they synthesized two-dimensional hexagonal SiTiO y , Al 2 TiO y , ZrTiO y composites, the inorganic wall structure of the samples were amorphous, and detailed reports on the synthesis have not been given yet. Kim et al. [20] studied the effect on the stability of bimodal porous TiO 2 doped with Al 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 , SiO 2 . They concluded that the dopants not only delayed the anatase\u2013rutile phase transition, but also retarded the crystallite growth of anatase titania. There are many reports about mesoprous titania\u2013silica materials [21\u201323] , however, few reports referred to ordered mesoporous titania\u2013silica binary oxides because of the different hydrolysis\u2013condensation rate between titania source and silica source. Li et al. [24] synthesized hexagonal mesoporous SiO 2 /TiO 2 composite materials, and investigated the influences of aging conditions on the samples. They claimed that the materials have crystallized framework, but the crystallinity is not well. Additionally, thermal stability and photocatalytic activities of the samples have not been investigated. Li and co-workers [13] claimed that they fabricated a kind of ordered mesoporous anatase-based TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 nanocomposites and the ordered mesostructure remains up to 700 \u00b0C, however, detailed works on the synthesis and properties have not been given. Zhao and co-workers [25] studied the synthesis, structure and themal stability of ordered hexagonal mesostructured TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 nanocomposites. They found that the amorphous silica acts as a glue linking the TiO 2 nanocrystals in the mesostructured frameworks and improves the thermal stability greatly. However, the synthetic period was time-consuming (about 10 days) and the required crystallization conditions were severe (350 \u00b0C for 6 h). To date, ordered cubic mesoporous titania\u2013silica bianry oxides have not been reported. The mesoporous architecture may have a significant impact on the photocatalytic activity of titania\u2013silica binary oxides. The interconncted mesochannels in the cubic mesoprous titania\u2013silica binary oxides can serve as efficient transport paths for reactants and products and make a contribution to the photocatalytic activity [26] . In the present work, we report for the first time to synthesize highly ordered bicontinuous cubic mesoporous titania\u2013silica binary oxides with uniform pore sizes, high surface areas and excellent thermal stability. Such a mesoporous sructural feature may have interesting bulk-chemistry applications, especially for heterogeneous photocatalysis due to its high suface area and continuous pore channels [27] . The effects of acidity, water content in sol and heat treatment temperature on the formation and thermal stability of mesoporous structures were investigated. The adsorption study and photocatalytic test of the samples were also investigated with comparison to that of Degussa P25. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Pluronic F127 [F127, HO(CH 2 CH 2 O) 106 [CH 2 CH(CH 3 )O] 70 (CH 2 CH 2 O) 106 H] was purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich. Titanium isopropoxide [TTIP, Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 ] was received from J&K Corp. Tetraethyl orthosilicate [TEOS, Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 4 ], concentrated HCl (37 wt.%) and absolute ethanol (EtOH, CH 2 CH 3 OH) were all analytical grade. All chemicals were used as received. 2.2 Synthesis methods The highly ordered bicontinuous cubic mesoporous titania\u2013silica binary oxides were prepared by EISA method, using TTIP and TEOS as precursors and F127 as template. The molar ratio of the ingredients was (TTIP + TEOS):HCl:H 2 O:F127:EtOH = 1:(1.00\u20132.00):(7\u201315):0.005:30, TTIP:TEOS = 4:1. In a typical synthesis, 0.4 mL TEOS was mixed with 2.15 mL TTIP under stirring for 15 min, then a solution containing 1.1 mL concentrated HCl, 1 mL anhydrous EtOH and 0.8 mL distilled H 2 O was slowly added with vigorous stirring. During that time, the peptization of the initial precipitate occurred, generating a clear yellow sol. To generate nanocrystalline anatase and make TEOS hydrolyze, the sol was aged for 2 h at 35 \u00b0C before a structuring agent was added under stirring. Then a template solution prepared by dissolving 0.604 g F127 in 15 mL anhydrous EtOH was added dropwise to the sol. The resulting clear colorless sol was stirred vigorously for 3 h at room temperature. Then the mother sol solution was transferred from the reactor onto a flat glass with an area of 600 cm 2 . The sol extended sufficiently and formed an uniform thin layer. In the aging stage, the environmental humidity and the aging temperature were kept at 55\u201360% and 35 \u00b0C, respectively for about 3 days, then the cracked-free transparent thin layer was dried at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h, 100 \u00b0C for 12 h, 130 \u00b0C for 12 h in air to stabilize the mesostructure. Finally, the sample was heat-treated at 400\u2013700 \u00b0C for 2 h in air with the heating rate of 1 \u00b0C/min and cooling rate of 5 \u00b0C/min. The samples were labeled as TS- x - y - t , where x and y corresponded to the initial mole ratios of HCl/(Ti + Si) and H 2 O/(Ti + Si), respectively, and t was the corresponding calcination temperatures (\u00b0C). Especially, the samples prepared with the HCl/(Ti + Si) = 1.5 and H 2 O/(Ti + Si) = 10 and calcined at different temperatures were denoted as TS- t . For comparison, pure TiO 2 was synthesized in the same procedure but without adding TEOS. And the molar ratio of the ingredients was TTIP:HCl:H 2 O:F127:EtOH = 1:1.50:10:0.005:30. The obtained sample calcined at 400 \u00b0C for 2 h was signed as P\u2013TiO 2 . 2.3 Characterization Low-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXRD) patterns of all samples were collected in \u03b8 \u20132 \u03b8 mode using Rigaku D/MAX-2550 diffractometer (Cu K\u03b1 1 radiation, \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5), operated at 40 kV and 200 MA. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) patterns were collected in the same mode, but operated at 100 MA. The crystallite size was estimated by applying the Scherrer equation to the FWHM of the (1 0 1) peak of anatase, with \u03b1-silicon (99.9999%) as a standard for the instrumental line broading. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna 380 spectrometer. The sample was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in a 2100 JEOL apparatus at 200 kV. The porous structures of the samples have been measured using the BET method by nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms at \u2212196 \u00b0C. Before measurement, samples were evacuated overnight at 200 \u00b0C. By using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 system, the BET and BJH methods were applied for the determination of the specific surface area, and the mean mesoporous equivalent diameter, respectively. The methylene blue (MB) adsorption study was carried out as follows: 50 mg of catalyst was suspended in 50 mL of MB aqueous solution (20 mg/L). The suspension was then agitated in the dark for 60 min to achieve the adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium on the catalyst surface. The residual MB in the solution was analyzed by checking the absorbance at 660 nm with a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 100). The adsorption of MB is calculated by the initial concentration minus the residual concentration. The photocatalytic activity of each sample was evaluated from an analysis of photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution. 50 mg of catalyst was suspended in 50 mL of RhB aqueous solution (20 mg/L) using a 100 mL capacity glass tube. The suspension was then agitated in the dark for 60 min to achieve the adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium on the catalyst surface. Then the solution was irradiated with a high-pressure Hg lamp (300 W, 254\u2013600 nm, \u03bb max = 365 nm). The distance between the light source and the reaction tube was 20 cm. At regular irradiation intervals, the residual RhB in the solution was centrifuged and analyzed by checking the absorbance at 553 nm with an UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 100). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 X-ray diffraction The effects of acidity, water content in sol and heat treatment temperature on the formation and thermal stability of mesoporous structures were investigated through Small-angle X-ray powder diffraction (SAXRD) and Wide-angle X-ray powder diffraction (SAXRD). 3.1.1 Effects of acid Fig. 1 shows the SAXRD patterns of samples prepared with various HCl/(Ti + Si) molar ratios. From the variation of diffraction peaks, it can be found that the acidity of solution has a crucial effect on the order of mesostructures. When the H 2 O/(Ti + Si) molar ratio is fixed at 10, the appropriate HCl/(Ti + Si) molar ratio is in the range of 1.00\u20131.75, and the optimal HCl/(Ti + Si) ratio is 1.50. If HCl/(Ti + Si) < 1.00, no clear sol can be attained. Practically, no ordered mesostructure can be obtained when the HCl/(Ti + Si) ratio in solution is lower than 1.00 or higher than 1.75. In the acidic medium (i.e. lower HCl/(Ti + Si)), protons are adsorbed on the surface of titania oligomers (NBB) and silicate oligomers, which derive from the hydrolyzation of TTIP and TEOS respectively. Under the low acid concentration condition, the positive charge of protons which oligomers adsorb is too weak to control condensation. The indiscriminate condensation hinders the disorder-to-order transition before the formation of organized mesophases. On the contrary, under the high acid concentration condition (i.e. higher HCl/(Ti + Si)), more protons are adsorbed on the surface of titania oligomers and silica oligomers. The repulsive force becomes stronger and the inorganic polymerization is restrained [28] , which makes the condensation more difficult. Thus, it is hard to obtain organized mesostructure in this condition. 3.1.2 Effects of water content in sol SAXRD patterns of the samples prepared with various water contents in sol are illustrated in Fig. 2 . The results suggest that the water content in sol also influence the order of mesostructures. The suitable range of H 2 O/(Ti + Si) molar ratio is 7\u201315 when the HCl/(Ti + Si) molar ratio is fixed at 1.50. If the H 2 O/(Ti + Si) molar ratio is lower than 7, organized mesostructure can not be obtained. The inadequate folding of the F127 template is responsible for the lack of long-rang order. On the other hand, it is impossible to obtain clear sol with the H 2 O/(Ti + Si) molar ratio higher than 15 and hardly get organized mesostructure. The enrichment of the system in water is beneficial for adequately hydrolyzing the inorganic species and condensation, but it also can be a detrimental effect on the organization. 3.1.3 Effects of heat treatment Fig. 3 shows the SAXRD patterns of the mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxides heat-treated at different temperatures. The as-synthesized, TS-400 and TS-500 samples all exhibit two well-resolved diffraction peaks which assigned to a cubic symmetry. The two peaks can be indexed as (1 1 0) and (1 1 1) reflections, for the d value ratio of the two peaks is determined to \u221a2/\u221a3, suggesting that the space group of the mesostructure is bicontinuous cubic Pn 3 \u00af m [29] . After calcination at 500 \u00b0C, two well-resolved diffraction peaks can still be observed ( Fig. 3 b and c), indicating that the samples have high thermal stability. The sample TS-600 shows only one (1 1 0) diffraction peak, the (1 1 1) peak disappears. This suggests that the well-ordered mesostructure is partly destroyed. The destruction of mesostruture is caused by the further growth of nanocrystalline TiO 2 [30,31] . However, the main domain of the ordered mesostructure is still maintained. There is only an ambiguous peak appeared at the pattern of the sample TS-700, suggesting a complete collapse of the mesostructure. The d (1 1 0) spacings of the samples as-synthesized, TS-400, TS-500 and TS-600 are 9.21, 8.86, 8.44, 8.02 nm, respectively. The shrinkage of the cell parameters for the bicontinuous cubic mesostructure still proceeds continuously up to 600 \u00b0C. It is noted that the P\u2013TiO 2 without adding TEOS exhibits no diffraction peak ( Fig. 3 f), indicating that silica as a mesostructure stabilizer plays a key role in the enhancement of thermal stability. The WAXRD patterns ( Fig. 4 ) of mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxides show the effects of calcination temperature on phase structures of the sample. The as-synthesized sample shows several broad diffraction peaks, suggesting the formation of TiO 2 nanocrystallites [32] . The characteristic peaks of anatase and rutile are labeled in Fig. 4 , respectively. Comparison to the mesoporous titania\u2013silica composites reported previously [24,25] , whose wall structures were composed of pure anatase, mixed-phase crystal textures can be observed in our samples. The samples present a main phase of anatase with small amount of rutile. It has been widely reported that a certain amount of HCl can favor the growth of rutile nuclei [33\u201334] . In hydrochloric acid solution, the hydroxide groups in the pair of octahedrons sharing one edge are protonated. When a neighboring octahedron attacks the pair of octahedrons, the electrostatic repulsion between the neighboring octahedrons is favorable to further share the opposite edge between neighboring octahedrons. As a result, linear chairs of octahedrons are formed by continuously sharing the opposite edges, which lead to the formation of rutile. During calcination treatment, the intensities of diffraction peaks increase, indicating higher crystallization of titania particles. The sample calcined at 400, 500, 600, 700 \u00b0C shows a strongest peak at 2 \u03b8 = 25.72\u00b0, 25.38\u00b0, 25.38\u00b0, 25.32\u00b0, respectively, representative of (1 0 1) anatase phase reflections. Compared with pure anatase whose strongest peak generally shows at 2 \u03b8 = 25.28\u00b0, the peak positions shift slightly toward higher angles. Similarly, the peak positions of rutile also shift, implying a distortion of the crystal lattice of TiO 2 . The distortion is probably caused by the silica incorporating into the framework of mesoporous TiO 2 , a little part of Ti 4+ ions (ionic radius is 0.074 nm) are substituted by Si 4+ ions (ionic radius is 0.041 nm) and that leads to form Ti\u2013O\u2013Si in the lattice of TiO 2 . The 2 \u03b8 value of the sample decreases from 25.72\u00b0 to 25.32\u00b0 when the calcination temperature increases from 400 to 700 \u00b0C. It indicates that the Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bonds in the network of TiO 2 are partly disassociated. As the calcination temperature increases, the diffraction peaks of anatase phase become strong and narrow, denoting a higher degree of crystallinity and larger crystal sizes. However, the diffraction peaks of rutile phase have little change even at 700 \u00b0C. It implies that the crystallinity and size of rutile almost unchange during heat treatment. There are two possible reasons responsible for this. One probable reason is that the content of rutile is very low and the rutile particles can not grow upon these temperatures [35] . The other is that both the Ti\u2013O\u2013Si interface and the silica glass phase hindered the growth of rutile and restrained the transition of anatase-to-rutile. The sizes of anatase nanocrystals calcined at different temperature are calculated based on the Scherrer\u2013Debye formula and listed in Table 1 . The anatase size of the sample calcined at 700 \u00b0C (8.1 nm) is smaller than that of P\u2013TiO 2 (8.3 nm), indicating that the addition of silica could efficiently inhibit the crystal growth of TiO 2 particles during the calcinations process, which is in favor of improving the thermal stability. 3.2 Infrared spectra Silica is believed to play an important role in enhancing the thermal stability of the samples probably due to the generation of Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bond. The presence of the Ti\u2013O\u2013Si vibration band in the mesostructure titania\u2013silica binary oxides was confirmed by the FT-IR spectra ( Fig. 5 a). The spectrum of the sample TS-600 shows a peak at 949 cm \u22121 belonged to asymmetric stretching vibration of the Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bond [36\u201338] . This bond is possibly ascribed to the SiO 4 tetrahedron bonded to a titanium atom. The silica is incorporated into the framework of mesoporous TiO 2 and a little part of Ti 4+ ions are substituted by Si 4+ ions. This is in agreement with the WAXRD result. The band at 1180 cm \u22121 is due to the asymmetrical vibration of the Si\u2013O\u2013Si bond in the bulk silica [36\u201338] . It is noted that the peak of Ti\u2013O\u2013Si is not strong enough, which indicates that the quantity of silicon incorporated into the TiO 2 lattice is limited and the main silicon exists as amorphous silica. The amorphous silica can prevent the titania particles aggregating together and further growing into large scale, which makes the mesostructures avoid collapsing. The low-frequency band at 453 cm \u22121 is attributed to the Ti\u2013O\u2013Ti vibration of the sample [39,40] . The peak at 1628 cm \u22121 corresponds to the bending vibrations of O\u2013H, and the broad bands around 3416 cm \u22121 are assigned to the surface adsorbed water and hydroxyl groups [41] . The intensity of these two peaks are stronger than that of the pure TiO 2 calcined at 600 \u00b0C, suggesting more hydroxyl groups on the surface of the sample TS-600 due to the addition of silica, which can act as Lewis acid sites to easily adsorb oxygen and water molecules, possibly corresponding to a more powerful redox ability for photocatalytic reaction. 3.3 Transmission electron microscopy The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images ( Fig. 6 ) of the samples confirmed that the mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxides have a well-ordered bicontinuous cubic mesostructure. The materials show a laylike feature ( Fig. 6 a) at 400 \u00b0C, and a gridlike feature ( Fig. 6 c and d) at 500 and 600 \u00b0C, for pores have merged in preferential directions. It is consistent with previous reports [17,42] . At high calcination temperature, highly ordered mesoporous patterns are presented in large domain. The sample exhibits mesoporous channels from 3 to 4 nm and pore wall thicknesses from 4 to 5 nm, which is in agreement with the SAXRD patterns. The HRTEM image ( Fig. 6 b) shows both nanocrystals and amorphous phase of the framework. And the nanocrystals are found to be embedded in the amorphous phase with random orientation. Crystal planes can be clearly seen in the HRTEM image and the average d-spacing of the lattice fringes of the sample TS-400 measured from it is about 0.36 nm, which is in good agreement with the anatase d-spacing value (0.35 nm) calculated from the WAXRD data. Fourier-transform of the selected area ( Fig. 6 b inset) show some ambiguous diffraction rings of nanocrystals, which indicates the crystallinity is not very well, corresponding well with the WAXRD patterns. As the calcination temperature increases, the pore architecture is destroyed gradually. The self-assembly and structure evolution process is illustrated in Scheme 1 . In the peptization stage, TTIP and TEOS hydrolyze synchronously in the existence of HCl. Large amount of HCl can slow down the condensation and polymerization of TTIP and accelerate the hydrolysis of TEOS simultaneously. In the aging stage, titania species and silica species co-assembly with F127 and form ordered mesostructures. During the calcination process, titanate oligomers and silicate oligomers can cross-link with each other through Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bonds. Silica act as a glue between TiO 2 nanocrystals and improve the thermal stability of the meosostructures. However, when the calcination temperature increase up to 700 \u00b0C, silica can not effectively inhibit the growth of TiO 2 nanocrystals and the mesostructrures are destroyed. 3.4 Nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption Fig. 7 shows the representative N 2 adsorption\u2013 desorption isotherms and Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) pore-size distribution plots of the samples. All isotherms of the samples show similar type IV isotherms, which are representative of mesoporous materials according to the IUPAC classification. The isotherms display a H 2 hysteresis loop with a triangular shape and a steep desorption branch. The H 2 type loop indicates that the samples have ink-bottle-shaped or cage-type pores [43,44] , which is correspondence with the TEM images ( Fig. 6 ). BJH pore-size analyses using BJH model show that the mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxdies have a mean pore size in the range of 3.2\u20133.5 nm, implying the samples possess very regular pore channels. The half-height width of the pore-size distribution shows a narrow pore-size distribution, which is of great importance in selective adsorption of organic molecules. The textural properties of the samples calcined at different temperatures are listed in Table 1 .The sample TS-400 shows high BET surface area (234 m 2 g \u22121 ) and pore volume (0.18 cm \u22123 g \u22121 ). The BET surface area and pore volume of the sample decreases to 110 m 2 g \u22121 and 0.09 cm \u22123 g \u22121 , respectively when the temperature increases to 700 \u00b0C. As the temperature increases, the BET surface area and pore volume of samples decrease gradually. This suggests a partly destroy of the mesostructure due to the growth of the crystallites, which agrees with the SAXRD ( Fig. 3 ) results. However, the pore size is not significantly changed with the calcinations temperature increasing, which can be ascribed to the high thermal stability of mesoporous framework. 3.5 MB adsorption study As we know, the continuous pore channels can facilitate the transfer of reactant molecules, and the periodic surface structure allows structural orientation of guest molecules in the pores, which may result in the enhancement of activity and selectivity in catalysis [45] . However, if the pore channels are blocked, the reactants can not get into the pore channels and proceed reaction. Thus, the accessible pore of mesostructure materials makes an important effect on the efficiency of reaction occurring within the architecture. And accessible interconnected mesoporous structure is a particularly important property for maintaining a fast mass-transfer throughout the pore architecture. We investigated the accessible pore of the samples using MB as a probe molecule. MB is a kind of cationic dye with molecule diameter 1.1\u20131.2 nm, and the adsorption of MB by metal oxides such as TiO 2 follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm [46] . The well-defined optical absorption of MB provide an easy way to measure the accessible pore of the samples. Fig. 8 shows the adsorption of MB for the samples TS-400, TS-500, TS-600 and TS-700 compared with P\u2013TiO 2 and Degussa P25. The adsorptions of the mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxides were 4\u20135 times than that of P\u2013TiO 2 and Degussa P25. The results indicate that the titania\u2013silica binary oxides have open-pore structures and the probe molecule can get into the pore channel easily, which is favorable for photodegradation reaction. 3.6 Photocatalytic performance The photacatalytic degradation of RhB solution under UV light irradiation has been selected as a model reaction to evaluate the photoactivity of the synthesized mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxides. The degradation yield of RhB removal at various time intervals and the plot of \u2212ln( C / C 0 ) versus time are illustrated in Fig. 9 . The photocatalytic activity of commercial photocatalyst Degussa P25 was measured under identical conditions for comparison. The reaction follows first-order kinetics and the initial reaction rate constants were calculated according to the formula \u2212ln( C / C 0 ) = kt , where C / C 0 is the normalized organic compounds concentration and k is the apparent reaction rate constant. At 400 \u00b0C, the mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxide exhibits inferior photocatalytic activity ( k c = 0.0101 min \u22121 ), even though it has large surface area, which is due to its low crystallinity degree. With the calcination temperature increasing, the photocatalytic activity increases, which is ascribed to higher crystallinity degree. The mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxides calcined at 500 \u00b0C ( k d = 0.0180 min \u22121 ) shows similar photocatalytic activities with that of P\u2013TiO 2 ( k b = 0.0187 min \u22121 ). And the mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxides calcined at 600 and 700 \u00b0C show much better activities than that of P\u2013TiO 2 , which maybe attributed to their high surface areas, open-pore structures and high surface acidity due to the addition of silica. The sample calcined at 600 \u00b0C ( k e = 0.0456 min \u22121 ) shows the best catalytic effect, which is as high as that of Degussa P25 ( k a = 0.0458 min \u22121 ), and the percentage of degraded RhB reached 95% after 60 min. It is noted that the Ti content of TS-600 is much lower than that of P25. Thus the titania photocatalytic efficiency of TS-600 is considered to be better than that of P25. The sample TS-700 shows lower photocatalytic activity than that of TS-600, probably due to the sharply decrease of the surface area, loss of order mesosturcture and increase of crystallite size after calcination. 4 Conclusions Highly ordered bicontinuous cubic titania\u2013silica binary oxides have been prepared effectively through EISA method. The solution acidity and sol water content show important effects on the formation of ordered mesostructures. To obtain ordered mesostructures, suitable HCl/(Ti + Si) and H 2 O/(Ti + Si) molar ratios are necessary. The synthesized samples exhibit high thermal stability (up to 600 \u00b0C) due to the existence of silica. The silica is well-dispersed into the titania framework without phase seperation. And the titania and silica link with each other through Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bonds. Therefore, the silica can suppress the crystallite growth and inhibit the anatase\u2013rutile phase transformation, which are benefit for the stability of mesostructures. The mesostructured titania\u2013silica binary oxides have high surface areas, uniform pore diameters, open-pore structures and small nanocrystal sizes, which is favorable for the photodegradation of RhB under the irradiation of UV light.

Nonbiodegradable azodyes acid orange 7 (AO7) was selected as modal target to examine the photocatalytic activity of CeO 2 . AO7 could be efficiently degraded in aqueous suspension of CeO 2 under visible light illumination. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 sorption, transmission electron microscopic image (TEM) and UV/vis absorption spectrum techniques. AO7 solution was quickly decolorized and partly mineralized under visible light irradiation with existing CeO 2 . The photodegradation rate of this azodye catalyzed by CeO 2 is much faster than those occurring on commercial titania (Degussa P25) under otherwise identical conditions of visible light irradiation. Experiments were conducted to examine the adsorption mode of acid orange 7 on CeO 2 and adsorption capacity at different pH values. The possible degradation pathway has been proposed for the photocatalytic degradations by using certain radical scavengers and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) to determine intermediates. The enhanced photoactivity of the lanthanide oxide CeO 2 was attributed to the superior adsorption capacity and special 4f electron configuration.",

        "abstract": "Cr-doped TiO 2 (Cr-TiO 2) nanoparticles with anatase and rutile bicrystalline phases were synthesized by a simple one-step flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) technique. The influences of chromium doping on the phase composition, microstructures, and optical properties of Cr-TiO 2 were analyzed by the methods of XRD, TEM, EPR, XPS, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. It was revealed that Cr 3+ doping not only extends the visible light response of TiO 2 but also increases the content of rutile in the bicrystalline TiO 2. XPS results confirmed that Cr 3+ can effectively promote the formation of oxygen vacancy which is contributed to the anatase-to-rutile transformation. EPR analysis indicated that the existing state of Cr in Cr-TiO 2 is closely relative to the Cr content: Cr is mainly incorporated into the crystal lattice of TiO 2 when the Cr content is lower than 1at.%, while higher Cr content is favorable to the formation of Cr 2O 3 clusters. The photocatalytic activities of different Cr-TiO 2 photocatalytsts were evaluated in terms of the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) under visible light irradiation. Appropriate Cr 3+ doping can significantly enhance the visible-light photocatalytic activity of TiO 2, which is attributed to the improvement of visible light response as well as the suitable anatase-to-rutile ratio. Excess Cr 3+ doping is detrimental to the improvement of visible light photocatalytic activity, which is relative to the formation of Cr 2O 3 clusters as well as too high rutile content. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

During the double-jet precipitation process, the presence of gelatin and Cl- ions at low concentration was necessary for the formation of cubic AgCl grains. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to probe the morphological structure of Ag@AgCl grains for the first time, which showed that Ag NPs are anchored on the surface of AgCl grains like up-and-down mounds. Further characterization of the photocatalyst was also done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The as-prepared Ag@AgCl plasmonic photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of the azo dye acid orange 7 (AO7), phenol, and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). The photocatalytic mechanism was studied by radical-trapping experiments and the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), and the results indicated that \u2022O2 - and Cl0 are responsible for the rapid degradation of organic pollutants under visible-light irradiation. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

The resulting photocatalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). It was found that the boron and carbon modified TiO 2 showed obvious absorption in the range 400\u2013500 nm. XPS results suggested boron species entered into interstitial site of TiO 2 matrix and formed the B\u2013O\u2013Ti bond, while carbon species were in the form of carbonates species. EPR results showed the existence of oxygen vacancy in carbon and boron modified TiO 2 . This may result in the sensitivity of the as-synthesized photocatalyst to visible light. The resulting boron and carbon modified TiO 2 exhibited significantly higher photocatalytic activity than carbon modified TiO 2 and undoped anatase TiO 2 on the degradation of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The presence of carbon originating from organic precursor has great influence on the surface properties of B-doped TiO 2 .",

        "abstract": "Bismuth and Boron co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully prepared by a modified sol-gel method. The products were characterized with various spectroscopic and analytical techniques to determine their structural, morphological, light absorption and photocatalytic properties. The results reveal that all the samples consist of highly crystalline anatase with mesoporous structures. The experimental results further indicate that Bi and B species have been doped into the crystal lattice of TiO2 with Bi substituting Ti in the form of Bi3+ and B doped in the form of substitutional and interstitial B. The presence of Bi species facilitated the incorporation of B into the crystal lattice of TiO2. XRD and TEM analysis show that all the dopants (B and Bi) have the ability to inhibit particle growth of anatase TiO2 with more inhibition exhibited by Bi. Compared to pure TiO2, B and Bi singly doped TiO2; Bi-B co-doped samples showed better activities for degradation of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) and 2, 4-dichlorophenol under visible light irradiation. The highest activity is observed for 3% Bi-B-TiO2 calcined at 450\u00b0C. The superior performance of this sample is ascribed to the high surface area, ability to absorb in visible light, efficient charge separation as well as improved e- transfer associated with the cooperate effects of appropriate amounts of B and Bi in co-doped sample. Bi species are found to play a pivotal role in the co-doped samples. Superoxide radicals are the most reactive species in degradation of AO7 over 3% Bi-B-TiO2 under visible light irradiation. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

During NaBH4 reduction, large amounts of NaBO2 and carbonaceous impurities covered the surface of the TiO2 self-doped with Ti3+, resulting in an inhibition of visible-light absorption and photocatalytic activity. In the preparation, HCl solution was used to wash off the by-product NaBO2 and carbonaceous impurities coated on the surface of the catalysts. The samples were characterized by XRD, UV-DRS, ESR, XPS, and FT-IR analyses. After HCl washing, the photocatalytic activity of the Ti3+-doped TiO2 increased markedly, while the Ti3+ content remained the same. Furthermore, it was found that the visible-light photocatalytic activity of Ti3+-doped TiO2 depended on the amount of Ti3+ added, while there was no significant impact of Ti3+ doping on its UV-light photocatalytic activity. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The as-prepared and calcined mesoporous TiO 2 materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared and N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements. After calcinations at 350 \u00b0C, the TiO 2 co-doped with nitrogen and 3% ytterbium had the highest surface area (219 m 2 g -1) and retained ordered structures. Under visible light irradiation, 75% of 20 mg/L phenol solution was degraded after 10 h and 10 mg/L rhodamine B (RhB) was decomposed completely after 4 h. The significant enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of the modified TiO 2 is attributed to the synergistic effect of N and Yb. The N dopant extended the absorption to visible region and the Yb dopant was beneficial in stabilizing the mesoporous structure and restraining the recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "As an important reactive oxygen species (ROS) with selective oxidation, singlet oxygen (1O2) has wide application prospects in biology and the environment. However, the mechanism of 1O2 formation, especially the conversion of superoxide radicals (\u2022O2-) to 1O2, has been a great controversy. This process is often disturbed by hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH). Here, we develop a molybdenum cocatalytic Fenton system, which can realize the transformation from \u2022O2- to 1O2 on the premise of minimizing \u2022OH. The Mo0 exposed on the surface of molybdenum powder can significantly improve the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling efficiency and weaken the production of \u2022OH, leading to the generation of \u2022O2-. Meanwhile, the exposed Mo6+ can realize the transformation of \u2022O2- to 1O2. The molybdenum cocatalytic effect makes the conventional Fenton reaction have high oxidation activity for the remediation of organic pollutants and prompt the inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the adsorption and reduction of heavy metal ions (Cu2+, Ni2+ and Cr6+). Compared with iron powder, molybdenum powder is more likely to promote the conversion from Fe3+ to Fe2+ during the Fenton reaction, resulting in a higher Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio and better activity regarding the remediation of organics. Our findings clarify the transformation mechanism from \u2022O2- to 1O2 during the Fenton-like reaction and provide a promising REDOX Fenton-like system for water treatment.",

Both of undoped TiO2 and Ce-TiO2 samples exclusively consist of primary anatase crystallites, which further form spherical aggregates with diameters ranging from 100 to 500 nm. The photocatalytic activity of Ce-TiO2 was investigated for the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RB) aqueous solution both under UV and visible light irradiation. Doping of Ce(4+) effectively improves the photocatalytic activity under both UV light irradiation and visible light irradiation with an optimal doping concentration of 0.2 and 0.4%, respectively.

        "title": "Mesoporous titania with high crystallinity during synthesis by dual template system as an efficient photocatalyst",
        "abstract": "The mesoporous titania, designated MS-TiO 2 was successfully prepared via a new combination of pluronic P123 and poly ethylene glycol templates and acetic acid as the hydrolytic retardant with extremely high crystallinity achieved during synthesis process. MS-TiO 2 has remarkable thermal stability, biporous mesostructure and superior photocatalytical activity for phenol degradation and mineralization as compared to mesoporous TiO 2 prepared using single template systems. The anatase\u2013rutile phase transformation of the MS-TiO 2 was not observed up to 800 \u00b0C. The mesoscale order of MS-TiO 2 was retained after thermal treatment up to 450 \u00b0C as confirmed by low angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses. It maintained its pore properties at high temperature of 700 \u00b0C with a significant pore size 10.4 nm and pore volume 0.11 cm 3 /g. MS-TiO 2 has biporous mesostructure with the small mesopore of 5.5 nm and the large mesopore of 8.7 nm in mean pore diameters. The MS-TiO 2 showed higher photocatalytic activity for phenol degradation than mesoporous titania prepared using single templates and standard system of Degussa P25. The remarkably high catalytic activity of the MS-TiO 2 is attributed to its high crystallinity and biporous mesostructure. The phenol mineralization was confirmed using high performance liquid chromatography and total organic carbon analyses. Keywords Mesoporous titania Dual templates High crystallinity Phenol Mineralization 1 Introduction Functional metal oxide material, has been a hot topic of interest due to enormous application potentials of such materials as membranes, in catalysis, solar energy conversion and as chemical sensors [1\u20138] . Among these, mesoporous titania is of particular interest since this class of materials possesses well-defined porosity and large specific surface areas [9,10] . For photocatalytic degradation of organics, these desirable properties are anticipated to improve the photocatalytic activity. However, it is quite difficult to fabricate mesoporous titania with an anatase crystalline wall during the synthesis process with thermal stability. The relatively low thermal stability of the titania based mesoporous materials is often attributed to their phase transformation and pore shrinkage derived from elimination of the structure-directing agents and the wall is too thin to retain the mesoporous structure during crystallization [11,12] . From a viewpoint of catalytic application, it is very significant to synthesize the mesoporous titania with high crystallinity and thermal stability. Many reports focused on synthesis of mesoporous TiO 2 using costly titanium alkoxide or inorganic reagent as a Ti source, which was prepared via complex physicochemical process. The obtained mesoporous TiO 2 was usually an amorphous or poor anatase phase with poor thermal stability. The ideal material would be porous, highly crystalline and present a high surface-to-volume ratio to enhance exchange with a second phase or the environment. In the past, copolymer-directed TiO 2 synthesis has typically been limited to temperature treatments below 400 \u00b0C to prevent collapse of the mesoporous structure. The resulting limited crystallinity of TiO 2 annealed at these relatively low temperatures is thought to contribute towards its low electron diffusion coefficient due to a high density of trap sites. The combination of high temperature treatment while maintaining a high porosity has been demonstrated by Lee et al. [13] employing a combined assembly of soft and hard chemistries method. Recently, Yoshitake et al. [14] improved thermal stability of template (primary amine)-extracted titania through CVD treatment of titanium isopropoxide. Cassiers et al. [15] synthesized NH 3 -treated titania, which was stable up to 600 \u00b0C. The other approach is to use dual or multiple templates in different ranges to produce hierarchical pore structure. For the mesopores, the supramolecular arrays of amphiphilic block copolymers [16\u201318] or other surfactants are commonly used as templates, through which the materials exhibit a narrow pore size distribution. There are some reports about the use of dual template systems. Holland et al. [19] used arrays of monodiperse polystyrene spheres as templates for macropores and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide for mesopores. Sen et al. [20] synthesized silica materials with macro\u2013meso\u2013microporous structure using polystyrene spheres, F127 and P123 as templates, respectively. Sun et al. [21] presented a two-step route to produce bimodal pore structure. Firstly, MCM-41 nanoparticles were prepared, using CTAB as mesopore templates. Then the nanoparticles were cross-linked around assemblies of triblock copolymer to produce macroporous structure. Groenewolt et al. [22] prepared silica monoliths with bimodal pore structure by nanocasting mixtures of fluorinated nonionic surfactants and micelles of two hydrocarbon block copolymers. Micelles with different sizes formed by different surfactants acted as the templates for hierarchical pore structure. Sheng et al. [23] synthesize bi-porous TiO 2 using a double surfactant system of F127 and DDA (Dodecylamine). Smatt et al. [24] designed a dual-templating route to synthesize silica monoliths. PEG and CTAB were utilized as templates for macropores and mesopores, respectively. In the present work we employed a new combination of templates of pluronic P123 (P123) and poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and acetic acid (Hac) as hydrolytic retardant for the preparation of mesoporous titania. Mesoporous TiO 2 prepared using dual tempalates materials (MS-TiO 2 ) exhibited high crystallinity with a nanocrystalline anatase structure in the as-synthesized state, remarkable thermal stability and biporous mesopore structure. This new dual template system proved a valuable combination for the preparation of mesoporous anatase with special characteristics as compared to mesoporous TiO 2 prepared using single template systems. MS-TiO 2 showed the superior catalytic activity for phenol degradation and mineralization as compared to the standard system of Degussa P25 and mesoporous TiO 2 prepared using single template systems. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) Ti(OBu) 4 , PEG with the molecular weight of 600 (designated as PEG600), absolute ethanol and acetic acid (Hac) were analytical grade. Pluronic P123 [( M w ) 5800, HO\u2013(CH 2 CH 2 O) 20 (CH 2 \u2013CHCH 3 O) 70 (CH 2 CH 2 O) 20 H, EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 , abbreviated as P123], was purchased from Aldrich. P25 (a commercial nanocrystalline TiO 2 that consists of ca. 80% anatase and 20% rutile; BET area ca. 50.0 m 2 g \u22121 ) was supplied by Degussa. All the above chemicals were purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Double-distilled water was used throughout the experiments. 2.2 Catalyst preparation In a typical synthesis procedure, 5.0 g of TBT was added drop-by-drop to 30 mL of Hac aqueous solution (20%, v/v) under vigorous stirring. The mixed solution was sealed and stirred continuously for 4 h to obtain solution A. In a separate beaker, 3.0 g of PEG 600 and 1.0 g of P123 was dissolved in 20 mL ethanol under vigorous stirring to obtain solution B. Solution B was then added drop-by-drop to solution A. The final mixed solution was sealed and stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The resultant solution was then transferred into a Teflon sealed container for hydrothermal treatment under a constant temperature of 120 \u00b0C for 48 h. The precipitations were then collected and dried overnight in air at 80 \u00b0C. The as-prepared sample was then subjected to a thermal treatment process at 450 \u00b0C for 4 h. As-prepared sample was calcined at different temperatures as well. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the effect of the use of dual template system we replaced the dual template system with single template P123 and PEG. 2.3 Characterization The crystal phase composition and crystallinity of the obtained mesoporous-TiO 2 was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray diffraction patterns of all samples were collected in the range 10\u201380\u00b0 (2 \u03b8 ) for wide angle XRD and 0.5\u20138\u00b0 (2 \u03b8 ) for small angle XRD using a Rigaku D/MAX 2550 diffractometer (Cu K\u03b1 1 radiation, \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5), operated at 40 kV and 100\u2013200 mA. The crystallite size was estimated by applying the Scherrer equation to the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the (1 0 1) peak of anatase. D = k\u03bb / \u03b2 cos \u03b8 , where \u03b2 is the half-height width of the diffraction peak of anatase, K = 0.89 is a coefficient, \u03b8 is the diffraction angle and \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength corresponding to the Cu K\u03b1 irradiation. The morphology was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2011) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 system. All the samples were degassed at 473 K before the measurement. TGA/DTA was performed on the Perkin Elmer Pyris Diamond thermo gravimetric analyzer. 2.4 Photocatalytic activity test The photocatalytic activity was evaluated in terms of the degradation of phenol. Phenol was chosen as a model pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic activities. The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at 30 \u00b0C using a home-made reactor. 300 W high-pressure Hg lamp having strongest emission wavelength of 365 nm was used as a UV light source (the average light intensity was about 1230 \u03bcW cm \u22122 ), mounted 10 cm away from the reaction solution. The photocatalyst (0.05 g) was added into a 100 mL quartz photo reactor containing 50 mL of a 40 mg L \u22121 aqueous solution of phenol. The mixture was sonicated for 5 min and stirred for 30 min in the dark in order to reach the adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. Under UV irradiation and vigorous stir, each reaction was lasted for 5 h. Preliminary studies indicated a linear light absorbance verse phenol concentration and that the decomposition of phenol in the absence of photocatalyst or UV irradiation could be neglected. The reproducibility was checked by repeating the measurements at least three times and was found to be within the acceptable limit (\u00b13%). To analyze the concentration of phenol and degradation products, the suspension was first centrifuged and filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm Millipore membrane filters to remove the catalyst. The concentrations of phenol were measured with a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 100) with UV absorbance in the range of 200\u2013400 nm, and the absorbance at 269 nm corresponded to the maximal adsorption of phenol. The concentrations of phenol were calculated from the height of peak using calibration curve. The decrease of total organic carbon (TOC), which indicated the mineralization of phenol, was determined using an Elementar TOC analyzer. Phenol degradation intermediates were determined by the HPLC series 1100 (Agilent) is equipped with a reverse-phase C18 analytical column (Zorbax SB-C18, USA) of 150 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm and 3.5 \u03bcm particle diameter. Column temperature was maintained at 22 \u00b0C. The mobile phase used for eluting phenol from the HPLC columns consisted of acetonitrile and water (30:70 v/v) at a flow-rate of 0.3 mL min \u22121 . 3 Results and discussion In this procedure, we employ a new combination of template system of P123 and PEG with acetic acid. Acetic acid acts as the hydrolytic retardant, for better control of the hydrolysis process of titanium sources due to the chelating effect of acetic anions and formation of pH buffer [25\u201327] . In the new dual-template system the PEG affects the formation of the mesopore structure by changing the micelle size of P123. The addition of PEG enlarged the mesopore size and widened the mesopore size distribution of the material, it co-micellized with P123 and stabilized hydrophilic\u2013hydrophobic interface. The micelles of these block copolymers possess a higher hydrophobic contrast than only pluronic [28] or PEG type copolymers (the standard system), thus leading to a greater driving force for self-assembly. The long hydrophobic chain offers the possibility of synthesizing mesoporous oxides with thick walls that may lead to an increased thermal stability. The composite surfactants give a unique combination as compared to single template [29,30] and cooperatively self assemble to facilitate the mesoporous structure by inducing hydrolysis of TBT solution and to obtain thicker titania framework leading to high crystallinity and thermal stability of the mesoporous titania prepared using dual tempalates. Thus give the highly crystalline anatase in as prepared form. In this system anatase is formed during the synthesis process before calcinations. The moment of anatase formation depends on both medium and type of surfactants used, because the condensation rate of titania is influenced by the medium used and nature of surfactants. In acidic medium, titania is positively charged, because the pH is lower than the isoelectric point of titania. When the ethanolic solution of templates is added in the acidic acetic acid solution of TBT, the templates formed a strong interaction with titania which results in the less strong interaction between neighboring titania particles leading to less condensed state of mesostructured titania. Subsequently the hydrothermal treatment can condensate the titania particles into an anatase containing mesoporous structure as represented in Scheme 1 . 3.1 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTA) Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTA) was performed for the as synthesized MS-TiO 2 sample to replicate the calcination conditions as shown in Fig. 1 . The analysis was carried out at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min from 40 to 800 \u00b0C in air. Below 200 \u00b0C, 3.2% mass loss was due to volatile species (water, ethanol, acetic acid) [18,31] . Between 200 and 400 \u00b0C, a mass loss of 16.8% was raised due to the decomposition of the templates. Some residual organic matter, such as amorphous carbon or carboxylate species and possibly hydroxyl groups, was removed at temperatures between 400 and 450 \u00b0C with a mass loss of 2.5%. Above 450 \u00b0C the mass loss was negligible. There is a slight weight gain above 720 \u00b0C. This weight gain between 720 and 800 \u00b0C is only about 1.0% which could be due to the change in buoyancy as the density of the purge gas decreases with temperature. Based on this TGA trace and several related papers [31,32] , the as synthesized samples were calcined at 450 \u00b0C for 4 h for complete removal of templates from the thermally stable mesoporous titania. 3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXRD) patterns of the MS-TiO 2 as prepared and calcined at 450 \u00b0C show one high-intensity peak as represented in inset of Fig. 2 . With calcination the diffraction peak shifts to the lower angle which corresponds to the d -spacing increase. A clear retention of the diffraction line can be observed for MS-TiO 2 up to a calcination temperature of 450 \u00b0C, which is not possible without the use of dual template system. Whereas mesoporous TiO 2 prepared using single template the as prepared samples show small angle diffraction which totally disappear at 450 \u00b0C due to the collapse of the mesoporous structure as represent in inset of Fig. 3 a and b . The wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) patterns obtained from samples by dual and single template systems are shown in Figs. 2, 3a and b , respectively. These samples exhibit characteristic anatase peaks, which can be indexed to 25.3 (1 0 1), 37.2 (0 0 4), 48.9 (2 0 0), 54.0 (1 0 5), 55.3 (2 1 1), 62.4 (2 0 4) and 68.7\u00b0 (1 1 6) (JCPDS no. 21-1272). As prepared sample also shows the high intensity anatase peaks which suggest that anatase is the highly crystalline phase in the sample after preparation. This confirms that Ti sol originating from acetic acid and new dual template system can lead to better crystallized anatase titanium dioxide. This might be due to the benefits of replacing strong acid with dilute acetic acid. When HCl was used in place of acetic acid the obtained mesoporous titania is amorphous before hydrothermal treatment and show lower crystallinity of anatase as compared to mesoporous titania prepared using acetic acid as shown in Fig. 4 . It is well known that the titanium precursor rapidly hydrolyzed in strong acid (HCl) media often leads to the aggregation and formation of large size particles because of uncontrollable hydrolysis causes by the rapid pH change [27,33,34] . The mean crystal sizes calculated by Scherrer equation of MS-TiO 2 and mesoporous TiO 2 prepared using single template P123 and PEG calcined at 450 \u00b0C was 12.8, 13.7 and 14.0 nm, respectively [35] . When the as prepared samples were calcined up to 800 \u00b0C, the mean crystal size of MS-TiO 2 samples increased from 9.0 to 38.1 nm. 3.3 Thermal stability The crystal structure of TiO 2 depends on the temperature of heat treatment. It is commonly considered that the anatase phase of TiO 2 shows better photocatalytic activity than the rutile one. Fig. 5 shows high crystallinity with a nanocrystalline anatase structure even in the as-synthesize state. When the samples are calcined, the peak width and the intensity of anatase phase at 2 \u03b8 = 25.3\u00b0 become more strong and sharp which indicate the formation of larger crystallite size and higher crystallinity. Anatase TiO 2 can be obtained from not only the as-prepared sample but also those samples even heated up to 800 \u00b0C for 2 h, during which no rutile phase is observed as illustrated in Fig. 5 a\u2013f. When the catalyst is calcined at 900 \u00b0C, anatase\u2013rutile phase transformation is observed in the titania sample. The anatase (1 0 1) peak at 2 \u03b8 = 25.3\u00b0 and the rutile (1 1 0) peak at 2 \u03b8 = 27.6 are analyzed using the formula in order to estimate the anatase\u2013rutile ratio of TiO 2 samples: X R = 1 + 0.8 I A I R \u2212 1 where X R is the weight fraction of rutile in the powders and I A and I R are the XRD peak intensities of the anatase and rutile phases, respectively. When the samples of MS-TiO 2 are calcined at 900 \u00b0C, 70% anatase TiO 2 is transformed to rutile phase ( Fig. 5 g) while the samples prepared with single templates show this transformation at 700 \u00b0C. The results reveal that the present preparation is unique in producing anatase TiO 2 sample with considerably high resistant to the phase transformation to rutile. In our synthetic method, the thermal stability of the mesoporous titania is extremely high because the as prepared anatase was highly crystalline after hydrothermal treatment. Moreover, the dual template system, successfully maintained the distance between the anatase clusters incorporated into the mesopores and maintain its high pore properties at high temperature resulting in the suppression of the anatase\u2013rutile phase transformation up to 800 \u00b0C. 3.4 N 2 sorption data The pore size distributions and N 2 sorption isotherms of the MS-TiO 2 in comparison with mesoporous TiO 2 prepared by single template system at 450 \u00b0C calcination temperature are given in Fig. 6 . All the samples display similar nitrogen sorption isotherms. These isotherms exhibit a Type IV adsorption/desorption shape with a H 2 hysteresis loop, at high relative pressure range between 0.4 and 0.8 indicating the abundance of mesopores in samples. The isotherm of the MS-TiO 2 shows two major capillary condensation steps representing the two types of mesopores inside the titania particles. MS-TiO 2 exhibits biporous mesostructure with pore sizes of 5.5 and 8.7 nm while the mesoporous TiO 2 using single template P123 and PEG show the pore sizes of 6.3 and 6.8 nm, respectively. Up to 700 \u00b0C, the porous structure of the MS-TiO 2 is maintained as shown in Table 1 . The pore volume is sustained in the range of 0.24\u20130.11 cm 3 /g in the calcination range of 450\u2013700 \u00b0C. Detailed pore structure properties are listed in Table 1 . Generally, the anatase is transformed into rutile by thermal treatment in the temperature range of 600\u2013700 \u00b0C [36] resulting in the mesostructure collapse of the mesoporous titania along with a significant decrease in pore properties such as specific surface area and pore volume [37\u201339] . In contrast, the MS-TiO 2 has the stable anatase crystal up to 800 \u00b0C, resulting in the maintenance of its high pore properties at high temperature. 3.5 Transmission electron microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the MS-TiO 2 in Figs. 7a and 8a reveal that the titania particles are uniform, rounded and rectangular shape with pores in interstitial spaces between anatase particles, with anatase crystalline nanodomains of about 12\u201313 nm in size. These results correspond well with the domain size (ca. 12 nm) obtain from XRD. The single broad SAXRD peak of the TiO 2 at 450 \u00b0C ( Fig. 2 inset), indicating no discernible order of the pore arrangement in long range [40] is in consistent with the TEM micrograph. Such disordered structure can actually be explained by the interactions between the titanium source and the mesopore templates. The multivalent Ti species can associate preferentially with the hydrophilic polyethylene oxide moieties mediated by PEG and P123 to form crown-ether-type complexes through coordination bonds by the self-assembly of the resulting complexes according to mesoscopic ordering, directed principally by the microphase separation of the block copolymer species. If a larger Ti oligomer or cluster linked with a PEO segment is formed in hydrolysis and condensation, this self-assembly for orderliness would be obstructed. This leads to a converse action for forming ordered mesostructure. The corresponding well-defined selected-area electron diffraction pattern in Fig. 7 b of the MS-TiO 2 is also indicative of high anatase phase nanocrystallinity [13] . In Fig. 7 c, the presence of clearly resolved lattice fringes demonstrates that the framework of the mesopores is composed of anatase nanocrystals. Thus HRTEM and XRD indicated the presence of mesopore network with a highly crystalline matrix between the mesopores. Mesoporous TiO 2 prepared using single template indicate a collapse of the mesopore structure as shown in Fig. 8 b and c and confirmed by disappearance of SAXRD peak at 450 \u00b0C as shown in inset of Fig. 3 a and b. 3.6 Photocatalytic activities The photo degradation of phenol is employed to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of MS-TiO 2 and the mesoporous titania prepared with single template. No detectable degradation of phenol was observed without TiO 2 as the catalyst. For all three TiO 2 samples, adsorption was below 4.0% over the initial 1 h pre-equilibration period carried out in the dark, indicating that adsorption did not contribute considerably to the observed phenol removal. It was observed that these unique nanoparticles prepared by use of dual template system showed highest activity in the degradation of phenol. Degradation profile of phenol by MS-TiO 2 in comparison with samples by single templates and Degussa P25 is given in Fig. 9 . It shows that after 5 h of irradiation, near complete degradation of phenol is observed with MS-TiO 2 . Mesoporous TiO 2 prepared by use of single template P123 and PEG show 68.0% and 60.0% degradation, respectively, while the Degussa P25 shows only 40.0% of degradation under these experimental conditions. The photocatalytic activity of the MS-TiO 2 prepared by a combination of templates is far superior than that of the mesoporous TiO 2 prepared using single templates and Degussa P25. The increase in the photocatalytic efficiencies of MS-TiO 2 as compared to the mesoporous TiO 2 prepared using single templates and Degussa P25 is attributed to the high crystallinity of synthesized mesoporous-TiO 2 and the increased mesoporous parameters such as the mean pore size, BET surface area and the pore volume ( Table 1 ). Fig. 10 shows spectral changes during degradation of phenol, no new absorbance peaks are appeared after 5 h irradiations, indicating near complete degradation of phenol. The mineralization of phenol is confirmed by TOC and HPLC analysis as given in Figs. 11 and 12 , respectively. TOC is decreased more quickly in the reaction using MS-TiO 2 as the catalyst (94% in 5 h). It suggests that phenol degradation and mineralization is even more completed. The degradation of phenol with effect of calcination temperature is presented in Fig. 13 . The highest phenol degradation efficiency is observed at 450 \u00b0C and then decreased when the sample calcination temperature further increased up to 700 \u00b0C. This decrease of photocatalytic activity with calcination temperature is due to the collapse of mesopores and decrease of surface area as appeared in Table 1 . MS-TiO 2 at 450 \u00b0C shows highest activity due to high crystallinity, and well-defined biporous mesostructure and surface area [22] . The mesostructure allows the reactant molecules to more readily access the active sites and provide the more pathways for the reactants to enter and products to escape [41] . The high crystallization of anatase facilitates the rapid transfer of photoelectrons from bulk to the surface, which can effectively inhibit the recombination between photoelectrons and holes, leading to enhanced quantum efficiency [42,43] . Absorbance spectrum of phenol degradation is shown in Fig. 10 . It shows the main absorbance at 269 nm and another absorbance at \u03bb 249 nm as well as a tailing absorbance with a shoulder in the region of \u03bb 300\u2013400 nm. The new absorbance is observed at \u03bb 249 nm which is probably related to an intermediate degradation product (presumably 4,4\u2032-dihydroxybiphenyl) and the broad tailing absorption spectra are indicative of other aromatic degradation intermediates. After 5 h of irradiation, near complete mineralization of phenol is observed. The mechanism for phenol degradation is proposed in Scheme 2 on the basis of HPLC results. The photocatalytic oxidation of phenol involves complicated multistage processes. It has been demonstrated that the photocatalytic process with TiO 2 is energetically favorable for the decomposition of phenolic compounds and that two types of oxidizing species hydroxyl radicals and positive holes are involved in the transformation of aromatic compounds in oxygenated aqueous TiO 2 suspensions [44] . Various aromatic intermediates products are formed in the initial stage. These intermediate products then undergo further photocatalytic oxidation to induce ring cleavage to form aliphatic acids and finally, they completely degrade to CO 2 and H 2 O. Scheme 2 shows the detected intermediates of phenol degradation by HPLC data. By comparison of retention time with the standard components dihydroxybenzene (RT 3.0 min), benzoquinone (RT 2.3 min), 4,4\u2032-dihydroxybiphenyl, and maleic anhydride (RT 3.3 min) are the main intermediates identified. Because no other intermediates (e.g., aliphatic acids) are observed, it appears that the intermediates mentioned above further degraded to more polar compounds such as carboxylic acid and eventually degraded to CO 2 [45] . The further degradation of the intermediates is likely via several reaction pathways (including oxidative hydroxylation, ring cleavage, oxidative decarboxylation, etc.) that are simultaneously operative. HPLC graph ( Fig. 12 ) illustrated the removal of number of intermediates and phenol concentrations with the irradiation time. The photodegradation pathway proposed in Scheme 2 is consistent with the results of other research groups with anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles as catalyst [46] . 4 Conclusions New combination of P123 and PEG with acetic acid proved a suitable template system for preparation of mesoporous anatase with high crystallinity in the as prepared sample during the preparation method as compared to single templates system. MS-TiO 2 retained its mesoscale order up to 450 \u00b0C with highly crystalline anatase framework. MS-TiO 2 has higher thermal stability and biporous mesostructure. The pore properties were maintained up to 700 \u00b0C, which was attributed to the thermally stable anatase-nanocrystal framework. The catalytic activity of the MS-TiO 2 was much higher than that of the mesoporous TiO 2 prepared with single template and Degussa P25. The remarkably high catalytic activity of the MS-TiO 2 was derived from its high crystallinity and biporous mesostructure. The mesoporous structure could provide the more accessible site for pollutants and highly crystalline anatase enhance the quantum efficiency. This work provides a new pathway to design and fabricate novel photoactive materials for catalyst and other applications.

Higher ageing temperature facilitates the separation of organic phase and inorganic phase, while thinner sol layer facilitates the formation of homogeneous system and improves the mesostructural order of TiO 2 . Lanthanum dopant, which is more electropositive than Ti, can improve the thermal stability of mesostructure by enhancing the strength of Ti\u2013O bond. On the contrary, Fe and Pd dopants, which are more electronegative than Ti, decrease the thermal stability of mesostructure.

The obtained BiO/BiTiO composite films possess superior photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B, owing to the visible light response of BiO and the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes between the two components. As a result, the BiO/BiTiO (Bi/Ti\u00a0=\u00a01:1) displays the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light or UV light irradiation for the degradation of different organic dyes, including methyl blue, methyl orange and acid orange 7.",

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, FTIR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution transmission electron micrograph (HRTEM). The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated for degradation of methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solutions under visible light (lambda > 420 nm). The results of XRD, FTIR, XPS, and HRTEM analysis indicated that the structure of Fe compounds changed from Fe2O3 to \u03b3-FeOOH after redox treatment. Compared to N-TiO2 with Fe+3 ions, the catalysts after redox treatment showed higher photoactivity under visible light, and the formation of \u03b3-FeOOH was responsible for the improvement of photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, to the catalysts after redox treatment, the mechanism for degradation of MB under visible light is an opening of a central aromatic ring attacked by OHbull;combined with a process of \u03b3-FeOOH photoreductive dissolution. \u00a92009 American Chemical Society.",

The obtained samples were characterized by XRD, UV-vis DRS, FT-IR, BET, EPR and XPS. Compared with undoped TiO2 and S doped TiO2 photocatalysts, the FeS codoped TiO2 photocatalysts exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity for phenol degradation under visible light irradiation. The optimal ratio of Fe/Ti is 1.0 at%. It was revealed that the band gap of FeS codoped TiO2 was obviously decreased, extending the light response of TiO2 into visible light region, and sulfate ions were absorbed on the surface of the TiO2. The high visible light photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 was assigned to the beneficial co-effects between S and Fe. The doped Fe(III) and SO4 2- anchored on TiO2 surface are favorable for the separation of photo-induced electrons and holes, suppressing the recombination of electrons and holes and consequently promoting the formation of hydroxyl radical. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 physical adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet\u2013visible adsorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectra (PL). The photocatalytic performance of N\u2013F\u2013TiO 2 microspheres was evaluated by analyzing the degradation of acid orange 7 (AO7) under visible light irradiation. It was found that N\u2013F\u2013TiO 2 microsphere with mesoporous structure is composed by anatase phase, and the interstitial doping of nitrogen into TiO 2 lattice might be responsible for the visible light response. Meanwhile, F-doping could not only retard the transformation from anatase to rutile, but also increase the concentration of OH radicals in solution, which is beneficial for improving the photodegradation rate of organic compounds. The synergetic effect of nitrogen and fluorine doping leads to the high activity of N\u2013F\u2013TiO 2 for the photodegradation of AO7 under visible light irradiation.",

The as-prepared nano microsphere was composed numerous BiOCl nanoplates, which are fabricated together to form opening microporous structure. The preparation of BiOCl under different solvothermal conditions indicated that the formation of nano microsphere follows a glycol-assisted growth process. Two oxygen atoms in glycol coordinate with one or two Bi3+ ions to produce Bi3+-containing complexes. During the solvothermal treatment, glycol molecules were condensed via the catalysis of Bi3+ ions to produce H2O, which promoted the hydrolysis of Bi3+-containing complexes and the formation of a Bi-O-Bi structure in turn. The Bi-O-Bi structure then combines the Bi3+ in the solution via the interlinking action of the glycol and leads to the formation of BiOCl substructure. The BiOCl substructure grows up radially from the crystal nucleus to form a nano microsphere structure. The surface microporous structure of the nano microsphere favors the adsorption and the mass exchange of the dyes, consequently, the as-prepared BiOCl nano microsphere exhibits a good dye-sensitized visible light photocatalytic activity.",

Increasing the initial H2O2 concentration enhances the degradation and mineralization efficiency for nalidixic acid, while Fe3+ shows an optimal concentration of 0.25 mM. A complete removal of nalidixic acid and a TOC removal of 28 % were achieved in 60 min under a reaction condition of [Fe3+] = 0.25 mM, [H2O2] = 10 mM, T = 35 \u00b0C, and pH = 3. LC-MS analysis technique was used to analyze the possible degradation intermediates. The degradation pathways of nalidixic acid were proposed according to the identified intermediates and the electron density distribution of nalidixic acid. The Fenton-like degradation reaction of nalidixic acid mainly begins with the electrophilic attack of hydroxyl radical towards the C3 position which results in the ring-opening reaction; meanwhile, hydroxyl radical attacking to the branched alkyl groups of nalidixic acid leads to the oxidation at the branched alkyl groups. \u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "title": "Cooperative effect of crystallization temperature and NaF addition in the formation process and hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve",
        "abstract": "The hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 was conveniently and effectively improved by increasing the crystallization temperature and directly adding NaF to the synthesis gel. The crystallization temperature varied from 373 K to 403 K. The influences of NaF addition, crystallization temperature and crystallization time on the formation process and hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 were systematically studied here to solve the problem of poor reproducibility. Results from XRD patterns indicated that the crystallization temperature and crystallization time were very critical factors for the improvement of the hydrothermal stability besides NaF addition. The formation process of MCM-48 was significantly accelerated and the pore structure ordering was also greatly improved by increasing the crystallization temperature and F \u2212 /Si ratio. A high hydrothermally stable MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve was obtained after being crystallized at 393 K for 36 h in the presence of NaF, which endured the hydrothermal treatment in boiling water at least for 4 days. However, only an amorphous product was obtained when the crystallization temperature was further increased to 403 K. Results from Si MAS NMR, N 2 adsorption isotherms, TEM, Raman spectra and XRD patterns manifested that the improved stability of MCM-48 was attributed to the high silicates condensation degree and the excellent pore structure ordering. The possible reason for the successful formation of hydrothermally stable MCM-48 sample by controlling the crystallization temperature, time and F \u2212 /Si ratio was explained here. Keywords MCM-48 Fluoride ion Hydrothermal stability Crystallization temperature Crystallization time 1 Introduction M41S mesoporous molecular sieves including unidimensional hexagonal MCM-41, three-dimensional cubic MCM-48 and unstable lamellar MCM-50, have large BET surface area up to 1000 m 2 /g, continuously controllable pore diameter between 2 and 10 nm and highly ordered pore channel [1,2] . These materials have drawn tremendous attentions from various research fields due to their excellent structure characteristics and great potential applications such as catalysts [3\u20135] , drug deliver carriers [6,7] and adsorbents [8,9] . It seems that cubic MCM-48 is more attractive than other meso-silica materials since it has a highly interwoven channel structure, which can effectively avoid pore block by guest molecules. Nevertheless, most of current researches were involved with MCM-41 due to the difficult synthesis for MCM-48 [10\u201315] . MCM-48 is an intermediate of hexagonal MCM-41 and lamellar MCM-50, so its cubic I a3d mesophase is unstable and liable to transform into other mesoporous phases, which results in the poor reproducibility of its preparation [16,17] . Xu et al. reported the phase transformation from MCM-48 to other phases can be prevented by adjusting the pH value of the synthesis gel or selecting the reaction time [17] . So the synthesis of MCM-48 is more rigorous than that of MCM-41 or other mesoporous products. Moreover, the formation of MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve generally needs longer reaction time than that of MCM-41 [18,19] . Gallis and Landry [20] and Kim et al. [21] reported that increasing crystallization temperature could greatly reduce the synthesis time for MCM-48. However, a rapid synthesis process often engenders inferior pore ordering and framework stability. Up to now, fast synthesis of high quality MCM-48 silica materials is still difficult but desirable. The structure stability is very important for the wide applications of meso-silica materials and numerous efforts have been devoted to improving it. Presently, the structure stability of mesoporous molecular sieve can be enhanced by silylation [22] , post treatment in water [23] and adding salts during crystallization process [24] . However, these ways need either repeated operations or long crystallization time, resulting in the high cost and low efficiency. Up to now, the one-pot synthesis of meso-silica materials with hydrothermal stability is still very difficult. It leads to the much fewer attentions on improving the hydrothermal stability of cubic MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve. Xia et al. [25] reported that the addition of HF can improve the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48. Kim et al. [26] reported that the combination of direct addition of NaF to the synthesis gel and post treatment in NaF solution can also improve its hydrothermal stability. However, the two means either need long crystallization time or require tedious post treatment process. We have concentrated on improving the framework stability of MCM-48 materials since a structurally stable MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve with highly interwoven channel structure is more attractive than its one-dimensional counterpart, MCM-41. Recently, we reported a novel method for improving the hydrothermal stability of Si-, Ce- and Fe-MCM-48 by directly adding fluoride ions to the initial synthesis gel [27,28] . The influence of NaF addition procedure on the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 was singled out by keeping all other experimental parameters constant in those reports. However, it should be noted that MCM-48 is very sensitive to the synthesis conditions. The NaF addition procedure is not the decisive factor for the synthesis of high-quality MCM-48. We should systematically study the influences of the crystallization temperature, crystallization time as well as NaF addition on the formation process of MCM-48. It is helpful to solve the problem of poor reproducibility for the synthesis. In this paper, we also compared the hydrothermal stability of the MCM-48 materials synthesized at different crystallization temperature, crystallization time and F \u2212 /Si ratio. The optimum conditions for the synthesis of hydrothermally stable MCM-48 and the specific structure properties influencing the hydrothermal stability were found out. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The reactants used in this study were a tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica source, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium fluoride (NaF) and deionized water. The typical composition for synthesis of MCM-48 was: 1.0TEOS:0.65CTAB:0.5NaOH:62H 2 O: x NaF, where x varied from 0 to 0.6. 2.2 Experimental The MCM-48 molecular sieve was prepared as follows: 10 mL of TEOS was mixed with 50 mL of deionized water and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 40 min at 308 K, then 0.9 g of NaOH and 10.61 g of CTAB were added into the mixture in succession and continued stirring for 60 min. After that, 0\u20131.13 g of NaF was added into the mixture. After another 60 min of vigorously stirring, the mixture was heated in an autoclave under static condition at 373 K, 383 K, 393 K or 403 K for various times from 24 h to 72 h. The resulting product was filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at 373 K. The as-synthesized samples were then calcined in air for 6 h at 823 K, increasing the temperature to 823 K at 2 K/min of heating rate. 2.3 Hydrothermal stability test Calcined Si-MCM-48 (0.1 g) was boiled for different period of time in 100 mL of distilled water, using a flask equipped with reflux condenser. XRD pattern was obtained after this boiled sample was subsequently filtered and dried in an oven at 413 K. According to the XRD analysis, loss in the XRD intensity, as compared with that of the same sample before the boiling water treatment, was used to judge the hydrothermal stability. 2.4 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded on Rigaku D/MAX-2550 diffractometer using Cu K \u03b1 radiation of wavelength 1.541 \u00c5, typically run at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 100 mA. TEM analyses of the samples were done using a JEM 2000-EX (Jol) instrument and the electron beam accelerating voltage was 200 kV. N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were carried out by using Micromeritics ASAP 2010. For BET (Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller method), the as-synthesized samples were calcined following the procedures described in experimental section and the samples were then outgassed to remove moistures and impurities at 623 K for 5 h before measurement. Magic-angle spinning (MAS) 29 Si NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker DMX 400 instrument. Data were obtained at 79.45 MHz with 90\u00b0 pulses and 100 s recycle delays using zirconia rotors 4 mm in diameter spun at 5 kHz. The chemical shifts are given in ppm from external tetramethylsilane (TMS). The fluoride content was determined on a pH meter by potentiometric titration. The Raman spectra were recorded on the inVia Reflex spectrometer equipped with an optical microscope at room temperature. For excitation, the 785 nm line from an Ar + ion laser was focused. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis 3.1.1 Influences of different crystallization temperature and crystallization time on the phase of the product synthesized with the aid of fluoride ion Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-synthesized samples prepared at different F \u2212 /Si ratios and crystallization temperatures: (a) 373 K, (b) 383 K and (c) 393 K. The crystallization time is fixed for 24 h. From Fig. 1 (a) we find that the samples synthesized at 373 K for 24 h are not the cubic mesoporous phase no matter what the F \u2212 /Si ratio is. The product is the mixed phases of the lamellar and cubic at F \u2212 /Si = 0.1. The lamellar phase is dominant, which gradually converts to cubic phase when the F \u2212 /Si ratio increases to 0.3. The cubic phase becomes dominant at F \u2212 /Si = 0.3. However, the formation of cubic phase is inhibited when the F \u2212 /Si ratio further increases to 0.4 or 0.5. It indicates excessive addition of fluoride ions is disadvantageous to the formation of MCM-48. It is caused by the interruption of excessive fluoride ions to the electronic interaction between cation CTAB + and anion silicates. The product finally becomes an amorphous phase at F \u2212 /Si = 0.6, which further proves that overmuch addition of external fluoride ions obstruct the electronic interaction between cation CTAB + and anion silicates. From Fig. 1 (a) we can conclude that increasing the F \u2212 /Si ratio is advantageous to the formation of cubic MCM-48, but too much fluoride ions is unfavorable. Different from the case at 373 K, the product synthesized at 383 K can more quickly change into cubic I a3d phase within 24 h. For example, the sample synthesized at F \u2212 /Si = 0.1 almost becomes the purely cubic phase except the [2 2 0] peak is a little broad. A purely cubic MCM-48 phase is ultimately formed when the F \u2212 /Si ratio increases to 0.2. The cubic phase remains at F \u2212 /Si = 0.3. However, the cubic phase converts to a mixed phases of the cubic and lamellar at F \u2212 /Si = 0.4. It finally becomes an amorphous product when the F \u2212 /Si ratio further increases to 0.5. In sharp contrast with the above conditions, pure cubic MCM-48 is more quickly formed at F \u2212 /Si = 0.1 when the crystallization temperature increases to 393 K. The cubic phase remains when the F \u2212 /Si ratio increases to 0.2 and 0.3. As expected, it turns to the amorphous phase when the F \u2212 /Si ratio further increases to 0.4. Therefore, increasing the F \u2212 /Si ratio can accelerate the formation of MCM-48, but the F \u2212 /Si ratio should not be too high. Moreover, it was found only amorphous product can be obtained when the crystallization temperature further increases to 403 K. It is because the overhigh temperature destroys the self-assembly interaction between cation CTAB + and anion silicates. The above results clearly manifest that increasing the crystallization temperature and F \u2212 /Si ratio can greatly promote the formation process of cubic MCM-48. However, the overhigh temperature or overmuch addition of fluoride ions is unallowable since they obstruct the interaction between CTAB and silicates. The subsequent investigation mainly dealt with the influence of crystallization time on the phase transformation process of MCM-48. Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of as-synthesized MCM-48 samples synthesized at F \u2212 /Si = 0 (a) and 0.1 (b, c, d) after various crystallization times. The crystallization temperature is set at 373 K (a and b), 383 K (c) and 393 K (d), respectively. Fig. 2 (a) shows the product is still the mixture of cubic and lamellar phases after reaction for 48 h at 373 K and F \u2212 /Si = 0. The cubic phase is ultimately formed after 72 h. Compared with the above condition, the sample synthesized at 373 K and F \u2212 /Si = 0.1 ( Fig. 2 (b)) more quickly changes into the cubic phase after 48 h. The crystallinity is improved after another 12 h. However, it does not further increase after total reaction for 72 h, which is actually lower than that of the sample crystallized for 60 h. As for the synthesis at 383 K and F \u2212 /Si = 0.1, the phase transformation process occurs more quickly than that at 373 K and F \u2212 /Si = 0.1. The mixture of cubic and lamellar phases formed after 24 h turns to the pure cubic phase only after another 2 h. The (2 1 1) peak intensity is enhanced after total reaction for 36 h, but decreases after 48 h. Finally, the sample changes into the mixture of lamellar and cubic phases after reaction for 72 h since MCM-48 is the mesophase of hexagonal and lamellar [17] . As mentioned above, a pure cubic phase can be formed at F \u2212 /Si = 0.1 after 24 h when the crystallization temperature increases to 393 K. The XRD intensity is also improved by prolonging the crystallization time from 24 h to 36 h. Similar to the condition at 383 K, the crystallinity decreases after reaction for another 12 h and changes into the mixed phases with most lamellar phase and slight cubic phase after reaction for 72 h. From Fig. 2 we can conclude that there is an optimum pore ordering for each MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve prepared at various crystallization temperatures. The higher the temperature is, the faster the highly ordered pore structure is formed. However, the crystallinity of MCM-48 sample does not linearly increase with the prolonging crystallization time, which begins to decrease after reaching an optimum value. The product ultimately changes into the lamellar phase after further hydrothermal crystallization treatment. It is noted that although the XRD intensity of the sample synthesized at 373 K is improved by prolonging the crystallization time from 48 h to 60 h, it is still much lower than that synthesized at 393 K for only 36 h. This means the sample synthesized at 393 K for 36 h has high pore ordering, which is confirmed by the TEM images. Fig. 3 (a) shows the low-resolution TEM image of sample synthesized at 393 K and F \u2212 /Si = 0.1 for 36 h. It is obvious that the appearances of MCM-48 particles are spherical and agglomerate. Fig. 3 (b), (c) and (d) are the high-resolution TEM images viewed along the (1 0 0), (1 1 1) and (1 1 0) direction, respectively. The uniform pore structure along (1 0 0) direction and the hexagonal arrangement along (1 1 1) direction reflect the actual shape and structure of the pore channel. The (1 1 0) direction is not the actual shape of the pore structure, but its regularity also illustrates the excellent pore ordering of this sample. 3.1.2 Influences of crystallization temperature and crystallization time on the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 sample synthesized with the aid of fluoride ion From Fig. 2 we found that each sample synthesized at different temperature has a best pore organization. Subsequently, we mainly investigated the hydrothermal stabilities of these cubic MCM-48 samples with best pore ordering. Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of calcined MCM-48 materials after being boiled in water for various times. N-373-72 denotes sample synthesized at 373 K and F \u2212 /Si = 0 for 72 h. F-373-60, F-383-36 and F-393-36 denote samples crystallized at F \u2212 /Si = 0.1 and 373 K for 60 h, 383 K and 393 K for 36 h. As seen from Fig. 4 , sample N-373-72 synthesized at 373 K without the aid of fluoride ion completely loses the mesoporous structure after hydrothermal treatment for 12 h. However, sample F-373-60 synthesized at 373 K with the aid of fluoride ion still preserves its cubic structure after being boiled in water for 12 h. It suffers great structure loss after another 12 h. So the addition of fluoride ions is advantageous to the improvement of the hydrothermal stability. As for sample F-383-36 synthesized at 383 K, the cubic structure is well kept after 24 h and does not greatly degrade until 48 h. In sharp contrast with the samples synthesized at 373 K and 383 K, the XRD intensity of sample F-393-36 synthesized at 393 K does not reduce much even after hydrothermal treatment for 48 h and still preserves two sharp and distinct characteristic XRD peaks of (2 1 1) and (2 2 0) after being boiled in water for 72 h. The XRD intensity of sample F-393-36 suffers greatly loss after the hydrothermal treatment for 96 h. This means the hydrothermal stability of this sample is extremely high. From Fig. 4 we can conclude that although the structure stability of MCM-48 materials can be improved only by adding NaF to the synthesis system, the combination of increasing the crystallization temperature and adding NaF can more effectively improve the structure stability. The above result shows that a high stable MCM-48 sample can be obtained at 393 K with the aid of NaF only for 36 h. We previously reported that MCM-48 sample synthesized at 393 K for 24 h can endure the hydrothermal treatment in boiling water for 72 h. So the framework stability is improved by prolonging the crystallization time to 36 h. Subsequently, we continued to investigate whether the much longer crystallization time for cubic MCM-48 materials could further improve their hydrothermal stability. Fig. 5 is the XRD patterns of samples F-393-36 and F-393-48 after being boiled in water for various times. F-393-36 and F-393-48 denote samples crystallized at 393 K for 36 h (a) and 48 h (b) and at F \u2212 /Si = 0.1. As mentioned above, the hydrothermal stability of sample F-393-36 is very high, which still preserves the excellent structure typical of cubic I a3d MCM-48 material after 72 h and does not greatly degrade until 96 h. In contrast, Fig. 5 shows that although the crystallization time for the sample F-393-48 is longer than F-393-36, its XRD peak intensity is more reduced than that of the sample F-393-36 after being boiled in water for 72 h. The above results clearly indicate the structure stability of the MCM-48 material synthesized at 393 K does not linearly increase with the increasing crystallization time. The optimum crystallization time for the formation of hydrothermally stable MCM-48 silica material is 36 h and a much longer time is instead disadvantageous to the formation of the high quality MCM-48 material. Table 1 shows the BET surface area, pore volume, average pore diameter and pore wall thickness of MCM-48 silica materials F-373-60, F-383-36 and F-393-36. It is obvious that the BET surface area and pore volume increase with the increasing crystallization temperature from 373 K to 393 K. However, the pore wall thicknesses ( W th ) calculated from W th = ( a 0 /3.0919) \u2212 (Pore Size/2) [30] and the average pore sizes of sample F-393-36 is similar with the other samples. It is reported material with thicker silicates wall has more rigid framework structure [29] , but the above results indicate the improvement of the structure stability of MCM-48 materials through our method is not attributed to the wall thickness. On the other hand, Table 1 shows that the unit cell contractions upon calcinations treatment are distinctly different for the samples F-393-36, F-383-36 and F-373-60. Sample F-393-36 shows the least shrinkage of a 0 upon calcinations. It is reasonable to suggest that the less contraction of the unit cell for the sample synthesized at 393 K is a result of better wall polymerization, which manifests that increasing the crystallization temperature maybe improve the condensation degree of silicates. 3.2 Framework structure analysis Fig. 6 shows the Si MAS NMR of various as-synthesized MCM-48 samples N-373-72, F-373-60, F-383-36 and F-393-36. All of samples show two broad peaks near \u2212101 ppm from Q 3 silicons in Si(OSi) 3 OH units and near \u2212110 ppm from Q 4 silicons in Si(OSi) 4 units [31] . Here Q stands for a silicon atom bonded to four oxygen atoms forming a SiO 4 tetrahedron and the subscript n indicates the number of other Q units attached to this unit. It is obvious that sample F-393-36 synthesized at 393 K for 36 h has the higher Q 4 /Q 3 ratio than samples F-383-36 and F-373-60, which represents the higher silicates condensation degree. It is accordant with the results from the comparison of unit cell contraction upon calcination. Mokaya [32] reported that the more condensed silicates framework of the as-synthesized sample results in the much more stable framework structure after calcinations. Sample F-393-36 has the higher silicates condensation degree than F-383-36 and F-373-60, so it is more stable. Moreover, the electrochemistry analysis shows the content of fluorine in the sample F-393-36 is 0.04%. The fluorine is assumed to be present as Si\u2013F bond in the framework, which is confirmed by the Raman spectra. As seen from Fig. 7 , sample F-393-36 shows a new band centered at 920 cm \u22121 compared with sample N-373-72 that synthesized without any fluoride. This band is related to the Si\u2013F vibration of a SiO 3 F tetrahedron [33] . It disappears after the sample is treated in boiling water for 96 h due to the hydrolysis. Moreover, for the sample N-373-72, the Raman spectrum shows a band at 605 cm \u22121 that is associated with localized modes arising from vibrations of defect sites. These defect sites make the sample more readily attacked by water [34] . The band at 605 cm \u22121 is absent as seen from the Raman spectrum of sample F-393-36, which means the framework of sample F-393-36 is more ordered. It is accordant with the result obtained from Si MAS NMR. Therefore, the addition of fluoride ions not only leads to the formation of Si\u2013F bonds, but also accelerates the formation of ordered silica network with fewer defects, thus improving the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve. Unexpectedly, although the silicates condensation degree of sample F-393-48 is similar with that of F-393-36 ( Fig. 8 ), its hydrothermal stability is lower as shown in Fig. 5 . It should be noted that in Fig. 2 the pore ordering of the sample synthesized at 393 K and F \u2212 /Si = 0.1 for 48 h is lower than that for 36 h, and the further crystallization treatment for 72 h finally makes the sample transform to the mixed product of cubic and lamellar phases. It is believed that a more regular pore system has less twists and defects in the framework, which may lead to the twist of the pore structure. Kim et al. [35] reported that KIT-1 material possessed the high hydrothermal stability by sufficient long-time salting treatment. They attributed the hydrothermal stability of KIT-1 material to the ordered local framework structure since silicates condensation degree does not change with the salting treatment time. So the higher hydrothermal stability of sample F-393-36 than F-393-48 is attributed to its excellent pore ordering with more ordered local framework structure. So we concluded that the highly condensed silica wall and the uniform local atomic arrangement in the framework are favorable to resist water attack, resulting in the high structure stability under hydrothermal treatment conditions. The fast formation of MCM-48 material synthesized at 393 K with higher silicates condensation degree was explained as follows. Stucky et al. [19] reported that the self-assembly of the organic\u2013inorganic meso-silica structure can be modeled by the surfactant packing parameter g = V / a 0 l , where V is the total volume of the surfactant chain plus any cosolvent molecules between the chains, a 0 is the effective headgroup area at the organic\u2013inorganic interface, and l is the surfactant chain length. Small values of g (1/3 < g < 1/2) stabilize more curved surfaces such as hexagonal MCM-41, and larger values stabilize less curved structures such as cubic MCM-48 (1/2 < g < 2/3) and layers ( g = 1). The formation of MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve is a slow phase transformation process and driven by the following factors: (1) the formation and growth of CTAB + surfactant micelles; (2) the interaction between cation CTAB + and anion silicates; (3) the silicates condensation. The increase of the crystallization temperature improves the effective packing parameter g value of CTA + ( g = V / a 0 l ) [36] , leading to the fast formation of cubic MCM-48 phase. The silicates condensation degree is accelerated by the higher crystallization temperature. The addition of NaF to the synthesis gel also leads to the fast silicates condensation. Therefore, the combination of increasing crystallization temperature and adding fluoride ions to the synthesis system leads to the fast formation of MCM-48 sample with higher silicates condensation degree. 4 Conclusion This report showed the results from studies of the influences of crystallization temperature, crystallization time and NaF addition on the formation process and hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve. The crystallization temperature varied from 373 K to 403 K and the crystallization time was between 24 h and 72 h. Results from XRD patterns indicated that directly adding NaF salts to the synthesis gel and increasing the crystallization temperature significantly accelerated the formation process of MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve. MCM-48 with the better pore organization was more quickly formed when the crystallization temperature increases from 373 K to 393 K, but only an amorphous product was obtained when the crystallization temperature further increased to 403 K. The formation of well-developed MCM-48 needed different crystallization times at different crystallization temperatures. The hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 was improved by adding fluoride ions to the synthesis system no matter what the crystallization temperature was, but it reached the highest when the crystallization temperature increased from 373 K to 393 K. The crystallization time was also very critical for the formation of high hydrothermally stable MCM-48 sample. MCM-48 synthesized at F \u2212 /Si = 0.1 and 393 K for 36 h had the best quality. It preserved cubic structure after being boiled in water at least for 4 days. Further increasing the crystallization time to 48 h instead decreased the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve. XRD, TEM, Si MAS NMR and Raman spectra indicated the high hydrothermal stability was attributed to the highly condensed silica wall and the excellent pore structure ordering.

        "abstract": "By using Au(S 2 O 3 ) 2 3\u2013 as the gold precursor, Au/TiO 2 photocatalysts were prepared by water washing (W) and rotary evaporation (E) processes, respectively. The samples were characterized by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic absorption flame emission spectroscopy (AAS). The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated from the analysis of the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO). By using the water washing treatment, well-dispersed gold nanoparticles with the diameter of 2\u20135 nm were formed on the surface of TiO 2 , whereas only the gold coating was formed for rotary evaporation processes. The photocatalytic activity of Au/TiO 2 photocatalysts is related to the preparation process. With a similar gold loading, the photocatalysts prepared by water washing showed higher photocatalytic activity compared to the catalysts prepared by rotary evaporation.",

        "abstract": "Photodriven nonoxidative coupling of CH4 (NOCM) is a potential alternative approach to clean hydrogen and hydrocar-bon production. Herein, a Mott-Schottky photocatalyst for NOCM is fabricated by loading Pt nanoclusters on a Ga-doped hierarchical porous TiO2-SiO2 microarray (HGTS) with an anatase framework, which exhibits a CH4 conversion rate of 3.48 \u00b5molg-1h-1 with 90% selectivity towards C2H6. This activity is 13 times higher than those from microarrays without Pt and Ga. Moreover, a continuous H2 production (36 \u00b5molg-1) with a high CH4 conversion rate of approx. 28% can be achieved through a longtime irradiation (32 h). The influence of Ga on the chemical state of a surface oxygen vacancy (Vo) and deposited Pt is investigated through a combination of experimental analysis and first-principles density functional theory calculations. Ga substitutes for the five-coordinated Ti next to Vo, which tends to stabilize the single-electron trapped Vo and reduce the electrons transfer from Vo to the adsorbed Pt, resulting in the formation of a higher amount of cationic Pt. The cationic Pt and electron-enriched metallic Pt form a cationic-anionic active pair, which is more effi-cient for the dissociation of C-H bonds. However, the presence of too much cationic Pt results in more C2+ product with a decrease in the CH4 conversion rate due to the reduced charge-carrier separation efficiency. This study provides deep insight into the effect of the doping/loading strategy on the photocatalytic NOCM reaction and is expected to shed sub-stantial light on future structural design and modulation.",

The composites contain agglomerates in as prepared form which transformed to nanorods at higher calcination temperature. As prepared agglomerates begin to transform into nanorods morphology at 600\u00b0C and acquires the nanorods morphology completely at 800\u00b0C. Tetrahedral tungstate ions with subsequent calcination result in fabrication and growth of one dimensional geometry. The fabrication and growth of the nanorods are illustrated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Presence of W inhibits the anatase phase transformation to rutile which shows thermally stability of the composite up to 800\u00b0C. The composite nanorods exhibit higher photo activity as compared to pure sample, Degussa P-25 and WO3 in degradation of Rhodamine B under visible and UV light. The highest photo catalytic activity of the composite at 800\u00b0C is due to retention of anatase form, unique structural characteristics, high surface area and tungsten incorporation. The new composite material extends the spectral response from UV to the visible region and reduces electron-hole recombination. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "A facile hydrothermal route employing H2O2 as structure-directing agent was explored to fabricate anatase microflowers with dominant {101} facets and anatase microspheres with exposed {001} facets. The influence of H2O2 concentration on crystal structure, morphology, and facet composition of TiO2 was investigated in detail. H2O2 plays a crucial role in determining the crystal structure, morphology, and exposed facets of TiO2. The presence of H2O2 favors the formation of anatase phase. When the concentration of H2O2 was in the range 0.7-3.3 M, anatase microflowers with dominant {101} facets were produced. In contrast, when the concentration of H2O2 was higher than 6.6 M, anatase microspheres with exposed {001} facets were formed. A mechanism was proposed to account for the influence of H2O2 on crystal structure and morphology of TiO2. Photocatalytic degradations of rhodamine B and 2,4-dichlorophenol indicated that anatase microspheres with exposed {001} facets showed much higher photocatalytic activity than anatase microflowers with dominant {101} facets. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) proved that the samples were in pure cubic phase. UV-visible diffuse reflection spectra showed the band gap of Bi(12)TiO(20) is about 2.7eV. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis proved that the Bi(12)TiO(20) samples have higher surface areas than samples prepared by methods reported previously. Photocatalytic degradation of acid orange 7 (AO7) under visible light illumination was used to evaluate the photocatalytic ability of samples. The photocatalytic results showed Bi(12)TiO(20) could degrade AO7 very efficiently and had higher photocatalytic activity than traditional N-doped TiO(2). In addition, we have also discussed factors that have major effect on reaction efficiency. BET surface area played the most important role in the photocatalytic degradation of AO7. The crystallinity of the samples is another important factor which can also influence photocatalysis results.",

The unique morphology of pits and dislocations interspersed on TiO2-B nanowires were firstly characterized and studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Oriented attachment is suggested as an important growth mechanism in the evolvement of pits and dislocations on TiO2-B nanowires. Lattice shears and fractures were originally formed during the ion exchanging process of the sodium titanate nanowires, which resulted in the formation of primary crystalline units and vacancies in the layered hydrogen titanate nanowires. Then the (110) lattice planes of TiO2-B grown in [110] direction is faster than the other lattice planes, which caused the exhibition of long dislocations on TiO2-B nanowires. The enlargement of the vacancies, which was caused by the rearrangement of primary crystalline units, should be the reason of the formation of pits. Additionally, the transformation from TiO2-B to anatase could be also elucidated by oriented attachment mechanism. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Degradation of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) was employed to evaluate the catalytic activity of the Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 in the presence of H 2 O 2 . Fe 3+ doping in the ceria improved the degradation of AO7 in the dark as well as under the visible light irradiation and showed the highest catalytic activity at Fe/Ce = 1/100 (FC100). XPS, Raman and EPR studies showed that Fe 3+ doping in the CeO 2 greatly affected the concentration of Ce 3+ . FC100 was found to have the highest Ce 3+ concentration. Raman and EPR studies confirmed the presence of surface peroxide-like species, which was derived from the complex of the surface Ce 3+ and H 2 O 2 . DMPO spin trapping EPR studies indicated that peroxide-like species played a key role during the dark-reaction, while OH radical induced the degradation of AO7 under visible irradiation. The amounts of both active species were remarkably increased in the FC100/H 2 O 2 system than those in the CeO 2 /H 2 O 2 system. Keywords CeO 2 Fe 3+ doping Ce 3+ Peroxide species Degradation 1 Introduction Cerium oxide (ceria, CeO 2 ) is an important rare earth metal oxide which has a wide range of applications in various fields including automotive three-way catalysts, water-gas shift reactions, solid oxide fuel cells, UV-blocking filters, oxygen sensors and protection of biological tissues [1\u20137] . Ceria has attracted intense interest because of its unique structure and properties: oxygen vacancy defects can be rapidly formed and eliminated on the surface of ceria, giving it the redox cycle of Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ and the high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [8] . Ceria-based materials (ceria doped with other ions) always exhibit better catalytic performance as compared to ceria. Doping ceria with trivalent ions (Pr 3+ and Tb 3+ ) was reported to lower the activation energy of oxygen release [9] , while doping ceria with smaller homovalent Zr 4+ could obviously enhance the thermal stability and OSC by decreasing the Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ reduction energy, preserving oxygen defects and retarding OSC degradation at high temperatures [10,11] . Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 has also received attention because of scientific interest in understanding the effect of doping with undersized lower valence ions to the practical applications of CeO 2 [12] . Consequently, Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 has been synthesized by various techniques, including hydrothermal, co-precipitation and template assisted methods [12\u201315] . Recently, Fenton-like reaction catalyzed by cerium salt in the presence of H 2 O 2 has been reported [16] . Specifically, it was proposed that the reaction of cerium and H 2 O 2 underwent the cycle of Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ with the generation of superoxide and hydroxyl radical. It is well-known that the catalytic activity of CeO 2 also relies closely on the redox cycle of Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ [1,2] . There have been many reports focused on promoting the redox cycle of the cerium ion, which enhances the catalytic oxidative activity of CeO 2 [10,11,17] . Conversely, the catalytic oxidative activity of the CeO 2 would be greatly reduced if the redox cycle of the cerium ion in CeO 2 was blocked, e.g., the catalytic activity of CeO 2 towards the superoxide species was inhibited in the presence of H 2 O 2 with high concentration (100 mM) [18] . Raman results in our previous work [19] indicated that peroxide-like species (O 2 2\u2212 ) appeared on the surface of CeO 2 after H 2 O 2 treatment. The as-formed peroxo-like species has a brown color and a relative chemical stability in the absence of the organic contaminants. Further studies showed that the degradation of organics depended strictly on their adsorption on the surface of CeO 2 , which suggested a localized surface reaction more than a superoxide/hydroxyl radical-attack pathway for the degradation of organics in the CeO 2 \u2013H 2 O 2 system [19] . It has been reported that impurity metallic doping into the CeO 2 can affect the catalytic oxidation activity of CeO 2 towards the molecular O 2 at high temperature [2,11] . However, the effect of the impurity metallic doping into the CeO 2 towards the catalytic oxidation reaction with the common oxidants such as H 2 O 2 at the ambient temperature has not been concerned yet. Therefore, Fe 3+ was selected in this work to be doped into the CeO 2 lattice to adjust the concentration of the oxygen vacancies, which might improve the catalytic activity of CeO 2 towards the organics degradation with H 2 O 2 . Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 with different doping amounts was prepared by hydrothermal method. The catalytic activity was evaluated by degradation of Acid Orange 7 (AO7). Raman, XPS and EPR spectra were employed to investigate the role of Fe 3+ on the catalytic degradation reaction of AO7 catalyzed by Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 in the presence of H 2 O 2 . 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O, Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O, NaOH and H 2 O 2 (30%) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. AO7 was purchased from Acros. The radical spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) (purity >97%) was obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry. All of the chemicals were of analytic grade and were used without further purification. Double distilled water was used throughout the experiments. 2.2 Preparation of the catalysts A hydrothermal procedure was employed to synthesize cerium oxide and iron doped cerium oxides [14,17] . 7.81 g Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O and desired amount of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O (molar ratio of Fe/Ce = 1/200, 1/100, 1/20, 1/10, 1/1) were dissolved in 60 mL water, and stirred at 30 \u00b0C for 1 h. An aqueous NaOH solution (5.0 M) was added drop wise to the mixture under continuous stirring until pH = 13.0. After 1 h stirring, the purple precipitates were transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and held at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitates were filtered and washed several times with water and then dried under infrared lamps over night. Finally, the catalysts were obtained after ground and calcined under ambient air at 500 \u00b0C for 4 h. The as-prepared Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 composites were labeled as FC200 (Fe/Ce = 1/200), FC100 (Fe/Ce = 1/100), FC20 (Fe/Ce = 1/20), FC10 (Fe/Ce = 1/10), FC1 (Fe/Ce = 1/1). Similarly, pure CeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 were prepared following the same procedure as control. The practical doping amounts of Fe 3+ in CeO 2 were detected by ICP-AES (Varian 710-ES). Table 1 shows the practical doping concentration of Fe 3+ in the CeO 2 , which is slightly less than the corresponding nominal doping concentration. 2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the catalysts was carried out with a Rigaku D/Max 2550 VB/PC apparatus using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15406 nm) and a graphite monochromator at room temperature, operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. Diffraction patterns were recorded in the angular range of 20\u201380\u00b0. The BET specific surface area ( S BET ) and BJH pore size distribution were determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77.3 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). Samples were degassed at 473 K for 5 h prior to the measurement. The morphology of the samples was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM 2100F), and the electron beam accelerating voltage was 200 kV. Raman measurements were performed at room temperature using a Via+ Reflex Raman spectrometer with the excitation light of 514 nm. The instrument employed for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies was a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA system with Mg K\u03b1 radiation (photon energy 1253.6 eV) operated at 300 W, and calibrated internally by carbon deposit C (1s) binding energy (BE) at 284.6 eV. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements for the catalyst powders were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker EMX-8/2.7 by accumulating three scans with the microwave frequency of 9.85 GHz and power of 6.35 mW. Both untreated and H 2 O 2 pretreated catalysts for measuring were placed into a glass capillary in pasty form. DMPO trapping measurements were detected at room temperature by adding DMPO (50 mM) into the reaction suspension and recorded by one scan. 2.4 Measurements of catalytic activity The catalytic activity was evaluated by measuring the decompositions of the AO7 (35 mg/L) aqueous solution with the addition of H 2 O 2 under visible irradiation or in dark. In a typical visible light irradiation degradation experiment, a total of 0.025 g of catalyst powder was added to 50 mL of the above AO7 solution in a quartz tube with vigorous agitation. The suspensions were stirred in the dark for 1 h to ensure the establishment of an adsorption/desorption equilibrium, then H 2 O 2 solution was added to reach a concentration of 1.0 mM. After 2 min stirring, the concentration of AO7 was recorded and set as C 0 . A 1000-W tungsten halogen lamp equipped with an UV cut-off filter ( \u03bb > 420 nm) was used as a visible light source. The lamp was cooled with flowing water in a quartz cylindrical jacket around the lamp, and ambient temperature was maintained during the vis-degradation reaction. At the given time intervals, samples were taken from the mixture and immediately centrifuged. The supernatant AO7 solution was withdrawn and analyzed by recording variations of the absorbance at 484 nm with a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 100). Dark-degradation experiment was carried out following the same procedure as the vis-degradation in the absence of visible light irradiation. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Lattice structure and the morphology of the Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 catalysts The XRD patterns of the different catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The pure CeO 2 displays a typical XRD pattern of cubic CeO 2 (fluorite structure, JCPDS 34-0349), while the XRD pattern of Fe 2 O 3 is consistent with that of hematite, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 (hexagonal, JCPDS 33-0664). The pattern of FC1 sample demonstrates the presence of both \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 and CeO 2 crystals, while only the characteristic diffraction angles of cubic CeO 2 are observed in the patterns of other composites (FC200, FC100, FC20, and FC10). A slight shift of the (1 1 1) peak of the CeO 2 is observed for doped CeO 2 in Fig. 1 . Fe 3+ ions were doped into the lattice of ceria to form a solid solution even at a Fe/Ce ratio of 1/10. \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 phase is observed in FC1 as the doping amount of Fe 3+ exceeded a critical value [15] . The lattice structure of CeO 2 is very flexible (a large fraction of the positions available for cations are unoccupied) and permits significant Ce 4+ ion substitution by various metallic cations of different sizes. For instance, it is well-known that CeO 2 can hold up to ca. 80\u201390% of metal cations as Zr 4+ , and still keeps the fluorite structure with distortions [1,15] . As for Fe 3+ , the XRD signals ascribed to \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 start to appear only when the Fe% in Fe 2 O 3 /CeO 2 composites is beyond 30% [12] . Physical parameters of the catalysts are calculated from the XRD patterns and listed in Table 2 . The average crystallite size is estimated using the Scherrer equation base on the (1 1 1) reflection of CeO 2 and the (1 1 0) reflection of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , respectively. Lattice parameter ( a ) is calculated by the following lattice parameter formula Eq. (1) . (1) a = d h 2 + k 2 + l 2 where a refers to the CeO 2 FCC (face-centered-cubic) lattice parameter, and h , k , l are the crystalline face indexes while d is the interplanar spacing. The diffraction angle (2 \u03b8 ) of CeO 2 (1 1 1) is shifted to higher values as the doping amount of Fe 3+ increased in the solid solution, which means the lattice parameter decreased with the increasing doping amount of Fe 3+ in the ceria. Since the size of Fe 3+ cation (0.064 nm) is smaller than that of Ce 4+ cation (0.101 nm), it is feasible for Fe 3+ cation to occupy either network Ce 4+ sites or interstitial sites in the fluorite lattice [1,15,20] . As a result, lattice shrink of CeO 2 occurred. Meanwhile, the crystallite size of the cubic CeO 2 grows with the increasing doping concentration of Fe 3+ . Moreover, BET specific surface area increases nearly one-fold from the pure CeO 2 to FC10. It seems that the Fe 3+ doping in the ceria stabilizes the solid solutions against thermal sintering (also see the pore volume). Similar effects of some other trivalent cations such as Al 3+ , La 3+ , Nd 3+ , and Y 3+ doping in the ceria have ever been reported [2] . It is suggested that the presence of trivalent cations on the surface of CeO 2 inhibits the sintering rate limiting step, that is, the surface diffusion of cerium defects [15,21] . TEM images in Fig. 2 a\u2013c show that the particle sizes of the CeO 2 and Fe 3+ -doped CeO 2 are about 10 nm, which are close to the values calculated from XRD results. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern ( Fig. 2 d) of prepared CeO 2 displays typical polycrystalline rings. 3.2 Catalytic activities of the Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 catalysts towards the H 2 O 2 for the degradation of AO7 It is well-known that Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ions in aqueous solution catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide along with the generation of hydroxyl radical, which leads to the oxidation of organics. Recently, it was further extended to the heterogeneous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /H 2 O 2 system for the degradation of organics such as AO7 [22] . Consequently, the catalytic activity of Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 catalysts with H 2 O 2 was determined by the degradation of AO7 aqueous solution. 3.2.1 Adsorption capacity It was suggested that the degradation of organics in ceria/H 2 O 2 system was tightly related to the adsorption of organics on the surface of CeO 2 [19,23] . Hence, the adsorption of AO7 on the various kinds of catalysts is presented in Fig. 3 . The adsorption of AO7 on \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 is very weak as compared to CeO 2 . Besides the larger surface area of CeO 2 than that of Fe 2 O 3 , the stronger adsorption of AO7 should be due to a chelation interaction between the electron-rich groups (sulfonate group, SO 3 \u2212 ) of AO7 and empty f orbital of cerium ion [23] . The adsorption capacity of Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 towards AO7 is variable according to different doping amounts of Fe 3+ and has an optimal Fe/Ce ratio of 1/100. Considering that the FC10 displays the maximum specific surface area among the catalysts, it seems that surface states other than the specific surface area of CeO 2 should be responsible for the maximum adsorption capacity of FC100. It was reported that the impurity metallic doping into ceria enhanced the concentration of oxygen vacancies [2,12] ; hence, the increased AO7 adsorption might be attributed to the increase of oxygen vacancies from the Fe 3+ doping, which promoted the chelation interaction between the sulfonate group and cerium atom [23] . 3.2.2 Dark reaction The heterogeneous Fenton activity of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 as shown in Fig. 4 A is relatively low and confirmed again in this work. As compared with the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , the CeO 2 exhibited a significant higher catalytic activity for H 2 O 2 to degrade the AO7. Fe 3+ doping obviously changed the reactivity of CeO 2 . FC100 presented the highest catalytic activity, either in degradation rate or in degradation rate per m 2 ( Fig. 4 B). The enhanced catalytic activity of CeO 2 was not because of tiny Fe 2 O 3 clusters on the surface of composites. As we know, individual Fe 2 O 3 clusters did not form in low Fe/Ce ratios; and even they were formed in FC1 and pure \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , the activities of the corresponding catalysts were particularly low. As a result, chemical factors other than special surface area play an important role in promoting the activity of Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 . 3.2.3 Visible reaction Fig. 5 presents the degradation of AO7 with CeO 2 , \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 in the presence of H 2 O 2 under visible irradiation. The doping of Fe 3+ favors the catalytic activity of CeO 2 at low level but retards the degradation of AO7 at high level with optimal Fe/Ce ratio of 1/100, similarly as in the dark reaction. The above results confirm that the catalytic activity of the catalyst towards the degradation of AO7 with H 2 O 2 , either in the dark or under visible irradiation, depends on its adsorption capacity towards AO7 rather than its specific surface area. 3.3 Surface sites of the catalysts and their interaction with H 2 O 2 The degradation of AO7 suggests that some active oxidative species are formed in the CeO 2 \u2013H 2 O 2 system. Considering the degradation reaction kinetics depends closely on the adsorption of AO7, the key step of the whole degradation process should be related to the surface of CeO 2 . Hence, several observations towards the surface sites of CeO 2 and Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 were carried out. 3.3.1 XPS spectroscopy measurement XPS spectra of the CeO 2 and Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 are presented in Fig. 6 A . It shows that no obvious signals of Fe appeared (Fe 2 O 3 2p 3/2 : 711 eV), even on the surface of FC10. This result is in good agreement with the XRD outcome. Because of the flexible lattice structure of CeO 2 , Ce 4+ can easily be substituted by large amount of metallic cations such as Fe 3+ with a slight lattice distortion, which results in the formation of solid solutions [1,12,15,24] . Ce 3d fine XPS spectra of the CeO 2 and Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 show that Fe 3+ doping results in some changes in the chemical state of cerium ions. The deconvolution of the Ce 3d XPS peaks and the corresponding meaning of each contribution were according to the literature method established by Burroughs et al. [25] , in which v n and u n refer to 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 spin\u2013orbit component of cerium ion, respectively. The Ce 3d fine XPS spectrum can thus be deconvoluted [26,27] and each deconvoluted peaks refer to Ce 3+ {two pairs of doublets: ( v 0 , u 0 ), ( v \u2032 , u \u2032)} [28,29] and Ce 4+ {three pairs of spin\u2013orbit doublets: ( v , u ), ( v \u2033 , u \u2033), ( v \u2034 , u \u2034)} [29] . The XPS spectrum of Ce 3d for FC100 is shown in Fig. 6 B with its corresponding deconvoluted peaks. The peaks at v 0 , \u2009 v \u2032 , \u2009 u 0 , \u2009 u \u2032 (880.4, 885.5, 898.8, 903.7 \u00b1 0.7 eV) represent the presence of Ce 3+ , while characteristic peaks of Ce 4+ present at v , \u2009 v \u2033 , \u2009 v \u2034 , \u2009 u , \u2009 u \u2033 , \u2009 u \u2034 (882.7, 888.96, 898.2, 901.3, 907, 916.7 \u00b1 0.7 eV). The semiquantitation of Ce 3+ in the catalysts can be obtained by calculating the relative integrated areas under the curve of each deconvoluted peaks, as shown in Eq. (2) [30] : (2) [ C e 3 + ] = A v 0 + A v \u2032 + A u 0 + A u \u2032 A v 0 + A v \u2032 + A u 0 + A u \u2032 + A v + A v \u2033 + A v \u2034 + A u + A u \u2033 + A u \u2034 A i is the integrated area of peak \u201c i \u201d. The calculated relative concentrations of Ce 3+ are illustrated in Fig. 6 C. The calculated [Ce 3+ ] values of about 7% in the catalysts are in good agreement with the reported XPS analysis in literatures [31,32] . The relative concentration of Ce 3+ is initially increased with the increase of Fe 3+ doping amount, and decreased at higher Fe 3+ doping amount, which presents a maximum Ce 3+ concentration in FC100 catalyst at Fe 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio of 1/100. Two mechanisms have been suggested about the concentration of oxygen vacancies for the impurity metallic doping in the CeO 2 , the vacancy compensation [9] and interstitial compensation mechanism [1,15] . The increased concentration of oxygen vacancies should be ascribed to the vacancy compensation mechanism [9] . As shown in Scheme 1 , besides the intrinsic oxygen vacancy in the CeO 2 , there are two additional kinds of oxygen vacancies: mode 1, substitution of one Ce 4+ cation by one Fe 3+ cation gives rise to the formation of one oxygen vacancy with the adjacent Ce 4+ reduced to Ce 3+ ; mode 2, one oxygen vacancy is created to balance the charge when two adjacent Ce 4+ cations were substituted by two Fe 3+ cations. Conversely, in dopant interstitial compensation mechanism [1,15] , Fe 3+ cation presented in the interstitial site neutralizes the negative charges caused by Fe 3+ substitution, and thus eliminates the appearance of oxygen vacancy. At small Fe 3+ doping amount, the vacancy compensation mechanism [9] is the dominant factor to charge the concentration of oxygen vacancy; therefore, the relative concentration of Ce 3+ is increased with the increase of impurity doping concentration. Conversely, the interstitial compensation mechanism [1,15] plays a more important role at higher Fe 3+ doping amount, which reduces the concentration of Ce 3+ . The evolution of the Ce 3+ concentration corresponds well with the trend of the catalytic activity and the adsorption capability of catalysts, which suggests that the catalytic reaction of the CeO 2 \u2013H 2 O 2 system is mostly centered on the surface Ce 3+ sites. 3.3.2 Raman spectroscopy measurement The Raman spectra for various catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . The pure CeO 2 displays a strong band at 463 cm \u22121 , which has been assigned to the F 2g vibration mode of the O atoms around each Ce 4+ cation [33,34] . The weak band at 1172 cm \u22121 is attributed to second-order phonon mode of fluorite structure [35] . The band at 593 cm \u22121 is known to be associated to the oxygen vacancies and has been widely observed in CeO 2\u2212 x [36,37] . However, the Fe 3+ doping into the CeO 2 increased the lattice distortion of the CeO 2 crystallite, and hence interfered with the vibrations of CeO 2 . As a result, the Raman band intensities of the Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 decreased significantly with the increase of the Fe 3+ doping amount. Therefore, an alternative approach to estimate the concentration of oxygen vacancies (593 cm \u22121 ) is adopted by comparing the Raman band intensity at 593 cm \u22121 ( I 593 ) to that at 463 cm \u22121 ( I 463 ) [12] . Fig. 7 B shows the evolution of the I 593 / I 463 according to the different Fe 3+ doping amounts in the catalysts. The relative concentration of bulk oxygen vacancies, that is the value of I 593 / I 463 , increased as the Fe 3+ doping amount increased. The result of XPS, in which Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 has a maximum surface oxygen vacancies concentration for FC100, is however different with that observed in Raman spectra, which should be due to the particularity of surface structure (XPS) to the bulk (Raman). Surface states of the catalyst play an important role in the catalytic oxidation of AO7 in the presence of H 2 O 2 ; hence, the surface information of the Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 was further observed via H 2 O 2 treatment in Raman spectroscopy. H 2 O 2 pretreatment has not obviously decreased the Raman band at 593 cm \u22121 ( Fig. 8 A) , which suggests that the oxygen vacancies does not disappear in the presence of H 2 O 2 . In other words, adsorbed H 2 O 2 on the surface of CeO 2 does not oxidize the surface Ce 3+ to the Ce 4+ . A new band appeared at 830 cm \u22121 in the presence of H 2 O 2 . The band at 830 cm \u22121 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of a peroxide-like (O 2 2\u2212 ) species [19,36\u201341] , which resulted from the surface cerium complex with the H 2 O 2 { Ce(O 2 ) + } [42] . According to our previous work [19] , the interfacial peroxide-like species { Ce(O 2 ) + } plays an important role in the degradation of organics in the pure CeO 2 \u2013H 2 O 2 system. The as-formed peroxide-like species is relatively chemical stable without organic contaminants, and can bear the pre-treatment for Raman measurement or be held in the desiccator for several days. Fig. 8 B presents the evolution of the I 830 / I 463 according to the different Fe 3+ doping amounts in the catalysts. FC100 presents the maximum I 830 / I 463 value, which indicates the highest amount of surface peroxide-like species is formed on the surface of FC100 among all the catalysts in the presence of the H 2 O 2 treatment. 3.3.3 EPR spectra measurement EPR spectra of CeO 2 and Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 are presented in Fig. 9 . The signal of g = 2.0 should be ascribed to ferric ions in the Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 , which is significantly enhanced with the increase of Fe 3+ doping amount [13] . The signal of g = 1.96 should be assigned to Ce 3+ [13,43] , which can be strengthened obviously with a trace amount of Fe 3+ doped into ceria. It is confirmed that a low doping amount of Fe 3+ into ceria increases the concentration of Ce 3+ . Fig. 9 B shows the EPR spectra of catalysts in the presence of H 2 O 2 . The signal of g = 2.0 was obviously increased CeO 2 after H 2 O 2 treatment. A weak signal of g = 2.0 is observed in the inset of Fig. 9 A. It was reported that the interaction between surface Ce 3+ of CeO 2 and molecular O 2 from air formed Ce\u2013O 2 \u2212 species and presented signals at g = 2.0 in the EPR spectra [43] . The stronger peroxide-like species (Ce\u2013O 2 \u2212 ) signals in Fig. 9 B originated from the interaction between surface Ce 3+ ions and H 2 O 2 . Further, a gradual g -value shift was observed for the Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 in FC200 ( g 1 = 2.0, g 2 = 2.05) and FC100 ( g 1 = 2.0, g 2 = 2.10). The g -value shift here should be ascribed to the Fe 3+ doping, which changes the electron coupling of the surface peroxide-like species. As for FC20 and FC10, no significant EPR signals for the surface peroxide-like species can be observed in Fig. 9 B. 3.3.4 DMPO spin trapping EPR spectra measurement DMPO spin trapping EPR spectra measurement was carried out to study the possible active oxygen species in the reactions ( Fig. 10 ). The sextet marked with \u201c\u2666\u201d for control experiment (CeO 2 and DMPO only) should be ascribed to the formation of DMPO\u2013CCR (CCR, carbon-centered radical) [44] , which was stable and kept unchanged even after 30 min at ambient or several weeks at \u221215 \u00b0C. The interaction between DMPO and some transitional metal ions such as manganese ion and cerium ion resulted in a metal ion-DMPO complex, which induced molecular rearrangement to produce a EPR active species as shown in Fig. 10 (curve a ) [45] . In the presence of H 2 O 2 , a typical signal of the DMPO\u2013 OH adducts (1:2:2:1 quartet) gradually appeared in the dark while that of the DMPO\u2013CCR adducts slowly disappeared ( Fig. 10 A). There are two possible pathways for the generation of the DMPO\u2013 OH adducts, attack of active OH radical to the DMPO or surface reaction of DMPO with the surface peroxide-like species. Considering the peroxide-like species at the surface of catalyst is relative chemical stable without organic contaminants, and the degradation of AO7 depends greatly on its adsorption at the surface of the catalyst, it is mostly that the reaction was carried out at the surface of CeO 2 following an intermolecular rearrangement mechanism with DMPO (and AO7). Under the visible irradiation, the DMPO\u2013 OH adducts appear more quickly and present a stronger intensity in the EPR spectra. Accordingly, catalysts exhibit a better catalytic activity under the visible irradiation than that in the dark ( Fig. 5 ). The enhanced catalytic activity and DMPO\u2013 OH signals should be due to the LMCT (ligand-to-metal charge transfer) from the excited colored adsorbate (AO7 here) under visible irradiation, which injects an electron to the surface peroxide-like species and results in the generation of hydroxyl radicals ( OH). The generated OH radical then attacks and destroys the organic substances such as AO7. Comparing the EPR spectra of FC100 with that of CeO 2 ( Fig. 11 ), it can be seen that the EPR intensity of the DMPO\u2013CCR slightly decreases, while that of DMPO\u2013 OH increases obviously, either in dark or under visible irradiation. It indicates that the amounts of either surface peroxide species or the OH radical were increased in the FC100/H 2 O 2 system than that in the CeO 2 /H 2 O 2 system, which confirms that the reactivity of the CeO 2 can be enhanced with a desired amount of Fe 3+ doping. 4 Conclusions A series of Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 were prepared with a hydrothermal procedure, which showed typical cubic CeO 2 structure from Fe/Ce = 1/200 to 1/10 with little fluorite structure distortion. XPS, Raman and EPR studies showed that Fe 3+ doping in the CeO 2 affected greatly the concentration of Ce 3+ . Lower doping amount of Fe 3+ improved the concentration of Ce 3+ as well as enhanced the adsorption capacity of AO7, which resulted in better catalytic performances. Further Fe 3+ doping decreased the concentration of surface Ce 3+ , which reduced the catalytic activity of the Fe 3+ doped CeO 2 . FC100 of Fe/Ce = 1/100 showed the maximum catalytic activity for the degradation of AO7 with H 2 O 2 . Raman and EPR studies confirmed that the amounts of both active species, the surface peroxide species in dark and the OH radical under the visible irradiation, were increased in the FC100/H 2 O 2 system than that in the CeO 2 /H 2 O 2 system.

The resulting materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N(2) physical adsorption, UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. Experimental results indicated that samarium doping inhibited the growth of crystalline size and the transformation from anatase to rutile phase. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated for degradation of salicylic acid under visible light irradiation. It was found that the Sm/N-TiO(2) samples presented much higher photocatalytic activity than N-TiO(2) and pure TiO(2) under visible light irradiation. This could be attributed to the appropriate crystallite size, more efficient separation of electrons and holes on Sm/N-TiO(2). In our experiments, the optimal dopant amount of samarium was 1.5% for the maximum photocatalytic degradation and the sample calcined at 400 degrees C showed the best reactivity.",

The as prepared films were characterized by wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Characteristic results clearly show that the architecture of Fe 3+ doped Ti0 2 is composed of mixed-phase crystal textures of anatase and brookite, and crystal size keeps at approximately 10 nm. After Fe (III) was successfully doped into titania lattice and partly substituted Ti (IV), absorbance of films in visible light displays obvious red shift.

Samples were characterized by different techniques such as, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis. DRS) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PLS). The XRD and Raman spectra showed only anatase phase of TiO2 for the pure, single doped and co-doped samples. The XPS of Ce showed the presence of both Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states. The PLS of the samples showed first decrease in the recombination centers when Ce was introduced in co-doped TiO2 with the maximum decrease for 0.05 Ce/N co-doped TiO2 and then started increasing with the increase of Ce in the samples. We found a direct relationship between the amount of recombination centers and photoactivity of the samples, which was evaluated by the decolorization of 25mg/L solution of Acid Orange 7 (AO-7). The activities of co-doped samples were highly increased by the incorporation of Ce with the maximum degradation exhibited by 0.05 Ce/N-TiO2 sample. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

The Ce-MCM-48 with a Si/Ce of 200 and 100, which were prepared by directly adding fluoride ions, could still maintain their mesoporous structures after refluxing in boiling water for 3 days. The incorporation of Ce into MCM-48 could enhance the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 in the absence of fluoride ions; however, the incorporation of Fe into MCM-48 materials barely improved the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 materials. The effect of adding NaF was much more efficient in enhancement of hydrothermal stability than that of the incorporation of Ce. The addition of fluoride ions mainly improves the degree of polymerization of silicates. The Ce(4+) ions in Ce-MCM-48 appear to be present partly in tetrahedral coordination in the framework and partly as CeO(2) particles on the surface of framework. The Ce positioned on the surface of pore walls and in the framework both provide the protection against water attack.",

        "title": "Preparation of TiO2\u2013SiO2 film with high photocatalytic activity on PET substrate",
        "abstract": "TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 films were successfully deposited on modified poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate as one of the thermal-sensitive material with different content of SiO 2 . The as-prepared films were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. At the ratio of Ti / Si = 1 : 1, the TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 thin film showed the highest photocatalytic activity due to improving the ability of the surface adsorption and increasing surface hydroxyl group in the composite thin film. Moreover, the SiO 2 \u2013TiO 2 composite thin film showed the most surface roughness, which further confirms the film with the highest photocatalytic activity at the ratio of Si / Ti = 1 : 1. When the ratio of Si / Ti more than 1 : 1, the decrease in photocatalytic activity is due to reducing amount of the surface acidity sites and photocatalytic center. Keywords TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 Thin film PET substrate Photocatalytic activity 1 Introduction In recent years, numerous researchers have focused on the photocatalytic activities of TiO 2 due to the strong oxidation power of its photogenerated hole under ultraviolet (UV) light [1] . To extend its applicability, many researchers have been developing various ways to apply TiO 2 coating on various substrates; promise to have high commercial potent applications such as self-cleaning, anti-bacterial and waste purification [2] . Comparing with the heat-proof substrate such as glass or steel, polymer substrates have low surface energy and thermal sensitivity. To solve the above problem, many methods have been applied to prepare high photocatalytic activity TiO 2 film at low temperature. Sheng et al. [3] prepared TiO 2 thin film on Pt-buffered polyamide substrates by magnetron sputtering. However, the cost and the feasibility of the process are considerable. Bao and Zhang [4] used sol\u2013gel method followed by the treatment of the films in boiling water to prepare the crystallized TiO 2 thin films and the treatment would affect the adhesion of the films to substrates. Liquid phase deposition (LPD) was also applied to prepare high photocatalytic activity TiO 2 film at low temperature [5,6] , and limited in the application for its low depositing rate and poor transmittance. To the best of our knowledge, there were few reports on preparing high photocatalytic activity TiO 2 film on the heat-sensitive substrates [5,7] . In this paper, we have deposited SiO 2 \u2013TiO 2 film on the modified PET substrate by advanced Sol\u2013Gel method. The effect of SiO 2 content has been discussed. When the ratio of Si / Ti = 1 : 1, the SiO 2 \u2013TiO 2 film showed the highest photocatalytic activity. 2 Experimental To modify the surface of the PET substrate, the cleaned PET substrate was immersed 5 min to the treatment solution which was prepared by KH550 ((aminopropyl) triethoxysilane) dissolved in acetone (1 vol.%) and aged for 240 h [8] . Then, the surface modified PET substrate has been formed. The method of TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 sol preparation is as follows. A 0.3 M aqueous peroxotitanium acid (PTA) gel was prepared by adding 100 ml 30% H 2 O 2 to 0.03 mol TiO(OH) 2 gel according to the literature [9] after stirring for 3 h, mixing with 7 ml different concentrations of SiO 2 sol (kindly supplied by Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences). The mixed sol was aged at 100 \u00b0C for 9 h and the final sol was transparent and uniform. The thin films were prepared by dip-coating using above prepared titanium dioxide sol; a withdrawal rate of 3 mm/s was used for all samples. The above dip-coating procedure was repeated once and the thickness of the films ranged from 280 to 310 nm, which was estimated via the interference oscillations in UV\u2013vis absorption spectra [10] . The film adhesion was tested by 3M SCOTCH600 Tape (kindly supplied by the 3M China Industrial Adhesive and Tape Division Distributor). The optical transmission spectra of films were measured using a UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer (UV-260, Shimadzu). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried out with a Rigaku D/max 2550 VB/PC apparatus at room temperature using CuK\u03b1 radiation and a graphite monochromator. FT-IR spectra were recorded on Magna550 infrared spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out using AJ-IIIa operating in the tapping mode. 3 Results and discussion The obtained films show good adhesion on the modified substrates; there was no fragment on the tape detected after peeling off on the modified substrate, while on the untreated PET substrate, TiO 2 film even cannot be formed uniformly and be easily peeled off. Irradiated under the sun for 1 month, all of the films still showed good adhesion without fragment on the tape detected, and the transparency also did not change, which indicates that the PET substrate coated with TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 mixed film exhibits high photochemical stability. FT-IR spectra of TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 thin films with different content of SiO 2 are shown in Fig. 1 . All the samples were prepared by dip-coating with the same withdrawal speed and dried at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h. The regions of 1400\u20131750 cm \u2212 1 are attributed to the bending vibrations of O\u2013H [11] . The band at 1100 and 800 cm \u2212 1 are assigned to the Si\u2013O\u2013Si bond. The absorption peak at 960 cm \u2212 1 is the overlapping of the band due to Si\u2013OH and Si\u2013O\u2013Ti bonds. In the system of TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 , the absorption of 960 cm \u2212 1 was mainly ascribed to the band due to Si\u2013O\u2013Ti bond [12] . The intensity of this band has been used to evaluate the absolute amount of Ti\u2013O\u2013Si linkages [13] . From Fig. 1 we can observe that when the ratio of Si / Ti is less than 1 : 3, the absorption peak at 960 cm \u2212 1 disappears, which indicates that most SiO 2 and TiO 2 grains exist independently and the amount of the Si\u2013O\u2013Ti is too few to be detected by FTIR. The broad bands at 2800\u20133800 cm \u2212 1 are assigned to O\u2013H for absorbed water molecules and Ti\u2013OH [11] . The film of Si / Ti = 1 : 1 has the highest intensity of this absorption, which was reported that the amount of the absorbed water was dependent on the surface microstructure. This is probably due to the fact that (d) surface has more acidity sites because of the formation of more Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bonds [14] . When the ratio of Si / Ti is more than 1 : 1, the intensity of peak at the region of 2800\u20133800 cm \u2212 1 becomes lower. It may be because that too much SiO 2 existed, and then the content of the Ti\u2013O\u2013Si in the surface of the film decreased, which means decreasing the amount of acidity sites. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of TiO 2 powder obtained by drying the sol with different content of SiO 2 at 40 \u00b0C. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the characteristic peak of anatase at 2 \u03b8 = 25.3\u00b0 is observed, so the crystal form of the TiO 2 films with a different Si / Ti ratio is identified as anatase. With the increasing content of SiO 2 , the intensity of the characteristic peak decreases. This implies that with the coexistence of SiO 2 , the rearrangement of TiO 2 is prevented [11] . The average crystallite size was calculated from the Scherrer's equation. The characteristic peak broadens with the increasing Si / Ti ratio, because the existence of SiO 2 limits the growth of TiO 2 grains. As shown in Fig. 3 , surface morphology of TiO 2 films with different SiO 2 content and heat-treated at 100 \u00b0C for 1 h was investigated using atomic force microscopy. The particle size and average roughness of the films are listed in Table 1 . Different from the grain size calculated from XRD results, those particles were formed by second particle with different aggregation states. From Fig. 3 and Table 1 , we can see clearly that the films of (c) and (d) have a larger particle size and more roughness than pure TiO 2 film (a), while (b) on the reverse. Bao and Zhang [4] had reported that the existing SiO 2 would behave as the \u201cneck\u201d and connects TiO 2 particles to form larger second particles. It can be assumed that SiO 2 acts as the \u201cneck\u201d only when Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bonds have been formed. If the amount of the Ti\u2013O\u2013Si is too few, such as the film of (b), most of TiO 2 and SiO 2 exist independently, and SiO 2 just limits the aggregation of TiO 2 particles. The photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 thin films with different SiO 2 content was evaluated by the decomposition of rhodamine B as shown in Fig. 4 . When the ratio of Ti / Si reaches 1, the film shows the best photocatalytic activity with 95% rhodamine B decomposed, almost 2 times of the pure TiO 2 film. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the unique physicochemical properties of TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 composite oxides resulted from the strong interaction of titania and silica particles at molecular level, such as smaller crystalline size, improved surface roughness and the generation of new strong acid sites on the surface. As we have known, the generation of new acid sites at the surface can be attributed to the imbalanced positive charge caused by chemically mixing tetrahedrally coordinated silica and non-tetrahedral titania at a molecular level [15] . Surface acidity is thought to take the form of stronger surface hydroxyl groups and to absorb more water molecules, which has been proved in IR spectra. In this way, SiO 2 acts as an absorbent, and TiO 2 as a photocatalytic center. Films of (d) had better photocatalytic activity than others caused by the SiO 2 acting as absorbent to accelerate the process of decomposition. However, in the film of (b) and (c), most of TiO 2 and SiO 2 exist independently and the additions of SiO 2 just reduced the content of the TiO 2 without improving the surface acidity sites of the films, which reduces the amount of photocatalytic center. So the photocatalytic activity of (b) and (c) films are lower than pure TiO 2 film, which can be obtained from Fig. 4 . The difference in the photocatalytic activity between (d) and (e) can be explained that the film of (e) contains too much SiO 2 which leads to less content of TiO 2 on the surface and reducing the surface acidity sites. Moreover, the surface morphology of the film also affects the ability of decomposition [7] . Rougher surface means larger surface area, and more photocatalytic reactions take place. It was also reported [16] that the fractal surfaces absorb light more efficiently and produce more photocurrent than smooth surfaces. That may be another reason for the film of Si / Ti = 1 : 1 has better ability of decomposition than others. 4 Conclusions TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 thin films with high photocatalytic activity have been prepared on the modified PET substrates by advanced Sol\u2013Gel method at low temperature. After PET substrates modified with silane coupling agent, the adhesion between TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 film and substrate has been improved. The effect of the SiO 2 content in the TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 film has been discussed. While the ratio of Ti / Si reaches 1 : 1, the TiO 2 \u2013SiO 2 film has the best photocatalytic activity, which is ascribed in improving the ability of absorption and enlarging the surface area. The results show that the photocatalytic activity not only depends on the crystallization of the film, but also depend on the surface absorbing and roughness.

        "abstract": "4-Piperazinyl- N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide (PMN) was synthesized and encapsulated into mesoporous molecular sieves. The fluorescent emission spectra and fluorescence decay of PMN/M-MCM-41 (where M = Si, Ce, Al) were used to investigate the photophysical properties of the hybrid composites. The emission intensity of 4-piperazinyl- N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide can be increased by decreasing the pH environment of the hybrid composites; the emission intensity varied with different MCM-41 hosts in the order: PMN/Al-MCM-41 > PMN/Si-MCM-41 > PMN/Ce-MCM-41; the fluorescence lifetime of PMN molecules followed the same order. The reasons for the improved fluorescence intensity and the prolonged lifetime of PMN in a low pH environment and Al-MCM-41 are discussed. Keywords MCM-41 Naphthalimide derivative Fluorescence Photoinduced electron transfer 1 Introduction MCM-41 (Mobile Crystalline Material) is an ordered mesoporous material, that comprises a honeycomb-like structure of uniform mesopores running through a matrix of amorphous silica. The hexagonally arranged uniform pore structure of MCM-41 has attracted much attention owing to its large surface area and narrow pore size distribution. The incorporation of dye molecules into mesoporous molecular sieves leads to organic\u2013inorganic composite materials. Compared with dyes in solution, these functionalized mesoporous materials have many advantages, such as high thermal and mechanical stability and high resistance towards UV radiation. Consequently such hybrid materials enable potential applications in optical sensors [1] , optical switches [2] , lasers [3] , frequency doubling [4] and drug delivery [5,6] . The transition metal and rare earth metal have been introduced into various kinds of mesoporous molecular sieves [7,8] . The dye molecules in such metal-doped molecular sieves are expected to exhibit peculiar photophysical and photochemical properties; electron transfer from the excited dye molecules to the titanium oxide can occur in the channel of Ti-MCM-41 [9] . Zhang et\u00a0al. [10] found large shifts in fluorescence spectra when C.I. Basic Violet 10 ( Rhodamine B ) was included in Ce-MCM-48, Fe-MCM-48, Cr-MCM-48 than that in Si-MCM-48 and the fluorescent lifetime of the cationic dye within Ce-MCM-48 decreased with increasing cerium content. Separation of charges is one of the most fundamental processes that have been investigated in numerous chemical and biological systems [11] . Electron donor\u2013electron acceptor molecules serve as an ideal system to mimic natural photosynthetic process. Naphthalimide derivatives comprising an amino moiety as electron donor and 1,8-naphthalimide as electron acceptor have been reported as fluorescent dyes in fluorescent sun collectors, liquid-crystal additives, fluorescent sensors, as well as fluorescent markers in medicine and biology [12] . The work concerns the inclusion of a naphthalimide derivative, 4-piperazinyl- N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide (PMN) as guest molecule within an inorganic matrix. According to the literature [13] , PMN molecules are able to recognize protons; photoinduced electron transfer (PET) within PMN molecules is considered as a significant pathway to fluorescence quenching between the fluorophore and the donor. Protonation of the terminal N atom will hinder the PET process and thus fluorescence will be regenerated. The effect of the local environment upon fluorescent emission spectra for different kinds of hosts as well as the fluorescence lifetime of the hybrid materials were investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of 4-piperazinzyl- N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide The method used for the synthesis of 4-piperazinzyl- N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide was reported earlier by Gan [13] . The particular synthesis method is depicted as follows. 4-Bromo- N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide was prepared from 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride and methtylamine aqueous solution at ambient temperature for 3 h. The mixture was filtered and washed by ethanol. Crystallization of the solid from chlorobenzene yielded a white solid which can be used without any purification. Mp 185.0\u2013186.5 \u00b0C. A round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser, was charged with 2 g 4-bromo- N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide, 20 ml methyl glycol, 4 g piperazine hexahydrate, and a catalylic amount of triethylamine and stirred for 4 h in an oil bath at 90 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and poured into water. Then the crude product was extracted by 80 ml ethyl acetate and the solvent was evaporated. Crystallization of the residue from ethanol and minimum amount of water afforded 4-piperazinzyl- N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide as yellow solid with a yield of 75%.

In a typical synthesis, 2.4 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was dissolved in 36 ml distilled water and 31 ml NH 4 OH. 10 ml tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) was added to this solution dropwise under stirring, after which, 10 ml metal ion aqueous solution was added to the ensuing gel and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. The molar composition of the final gel mixture was 1SiO 2 :0.01Me:0.15CTAB:11.6NH 3 :89.6H 2 O. Finally, the obtained mixture was transferred into Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 393 K for 48 h. The white solid was filtered, rinsed with large amount of distilled water and dried in air. The as-synthesized MCM-41 was calcined at 543 K for 1 h to remove the physisorbed water and then it was heated at 823 K for 5 h. The Si-MCM-41 was synthesized by the aforementioned procedure without adding the metal salt. 2.3 Incorporation of naphthalimide derivatives into MCM-41 by impregnation method The various MCM-41 were added to 5 ml dye solution (10 \u22124 mol/l, methanol/water = 4:1). After stirred for 3 h at ambient temperature, the solid was filtered and rinsed thoroughly with methanol and distilled water till the filtrate was clear. Then the samples were dried at 353 K for characterization. 3 Charaterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried out with a Rigaku D/MAX-2550 diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation within the scattering angel 2 \u03b8 range of 0.8\u201310\u00b0, typically run at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 100 mA. The UV\u2013vis absorption spectra were recorded with Varian Cary 500. The fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence photospectrometer. 1 H NMR spectra were measured on a Br\u00fccker AM500 spectrometer. The decay curves were recorded on Edinburgh FLS920. The infrared spectroscopic was made using a Nicolet 380 spectrometer from Thermo Electron (KBr pellet technique). All measurements were carried out at ambient temperature. 4 Results and discussions The XRD patterns shown in Fig.\u00a01 indicated that all these mesoporous materials have three typical reflections of MCM-41, corresponding to the (100), (110) and (210) reflections. All the reflections are indexed based on hexagonal symmetry. The maximum absorption peak position (397 nm) and the shape of PMN in MCM-41 is so similar to that in solution (shown in Fig.\u00a02 ), which indicates that the dye molecules exist in monomer form in MCM-41 due to high surface area. In Fig.\u00a03 , the emission band of PMN/MCM-41 is not symmetrical and tails to longer wavelength. The result corroborates the characterization of the bands as combination bands with significant contributions from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) normal (planar) mode transition as well as other accessible conformers [14] . The maximum emission peak of PMN molecules in Si-MCM-41 is blue-shifted to 493 nm, compared with that in methanol/water (v/v = 4:1) solution (520 nm). The large blue-shift (27 nm) of the emission band of PMN molecules in MCM-41 host in contrast with that in solution reflects that the local environment of MCM-41 has less polarity than methanol\u2013water mixed solvent. On the other hand, there are carbonyl groups in PMN molecules, which will form hydrogen bonds with silanol groups of internal surface of MCM-41. The interaction of the carbonyl groups with the silanol groups can be verified by the fact that they could not physically absorb in the silylated MCM-41 due to the loss of hydrogen bond, when the silylated MCM-41 was added to the dye solution. The rigidly held PMN molecules which prevent the exited states from relaxing could cause the pronounced shift [15] . Because there is no organic solvent around the dye molecule in molecular sieve, the lack of solvation of the excited state will also lead to destabilization and increasing energy between the ground state and the excited state. Otherwise, if solvent relaxation is slow compared with excited-state lifetime, as in a rigid glass, then in general, the optimum solute\u2013solvent configuration cannot be realized and an emission blue-shift results [16] . Hence we can deduce that the PMN molecules cannot attain the optimum configuration in such confined environment and result in the spectral shift. The fluorescence emission of PMN molecules in MCM-41 decreases drastically compared with that in organic solvent. The result can be attributed to the host\u2013guest interaction which causes non-radiated energy transition of the dye molecules. Moreover the width of the hybrid material's emission band suggests a greater dephasing of excitonic energy than that for PMN molecules in solution [17] . As shown in Scheme 1 , the fluorescence emission of the fluorophore ( N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide) is quenched via photoinduced electron transfer (PET) within PMN molecule. This PET process occurs from the donor (piperadine) to the fluorophore ( N -methyl-1,8-naphthalimide). When the PET process is stopped by protonation, the fluorescence of the fluorophore will be recovered. We speculated that the emission intensity of PMN molecules in MCM-41 changes with different pH values. So we design the experiment in such a way that the dye encapsulated MCM-41 is added into aqueous solution at different pH values and investigate its fluorescent emission intensity. The result shown in Fig.\u00a04 validates our deduction that the maximum emission intensity of PMN molecules in MCM-41 under acid condition increases 3.45 times than that under basic condition. The fluorescence enhancement effect in MCM-41 by hindering the PET process is not distinct as compared with that in solution [13] . The explanation can be rationalized that hydroxide ions or protons are difficult to diffuse into the pore structure of MCM-41 and bind with terminal N atom of PMN molecules in the deep location. With the increasing pH value, the emission peak is red-shifted ( Fig.\u00a04 ). Gan et\u00a0al. also found the same phenomenon in solution [18] . Continuing with Fig.\u00a05 , it is observed that the emission peaks of PMN in Si-MCM-41, Al-MCM-41, Ce-MCM-41 are almost at the same position, but have remarkably different intensity. To our knowledge, metal ions introduced into MCM-41 will quench the fluorescence of encapsulated dye molecules. Because the occurrences of the high charge transfer efficiency between dye molecules and metal-doped mesoporous material can quench the fluorescence of dyes. But in our researching system, it can only be observed in the PMN/Ce-MCM-41 system. The fluorescence of PMN in Al-MCM-41 increases by 54.2% than that in Si-MCM-41. This unexpected result can be attributed to the increasing anchored amount and the acid sites in Al-MCM-41. Besides the silanol sites, the metal ion sites can also easily absorb such neutral dye molecules. The acid sites presented in Al-MCM-41 can afford protons to prevent PET process within PMN molecule and recover the fluorescence. Maybe the unexpected fluorescence enhancement can also be explained that the protonated PMN molecules cannot approach the Al 3+ sites nearly and decrease the electron transfer efficiency owing to electrostatic repulsion. This unusual result has been supported by the fluorescence decay data which is depicted below. Table 1 shows that all fluorescence decay curves of PMN in mesoporous materials exhibit biexponential decay curves, compared with the monoexponential decay curve of PMN in solution. The biexponential decay curves have a longer lifetime ( \u03c4 1 ) and a shorter one ( \u03c4 2 ). It indicates that the dye molecules absorb on two types of existing site. As shown in the fluorescence decay data of PMN in metal-doped MCM-41 ( Fig.\u00a06 ), the long lifetime ( \u03c4 1 ) probably represents the dye molecules absorb on the silanol sites and the short one ( \u03c4 2 ) represents the dye molecules absorb on the isolated metal ion sites. For the short lifetime form, the PMN molecules are fixed on the isolated metal ion sites and high energy transition efficiency can occur between guests and hosts. As shown in Fig.\u00a06 , the lifetime of PMN in Al-MCM-41 is much longer than that in Ce-MCM-41. The explanations are listed below. (1) The acid sites in Al-MCM-41 can release protons and make the PMN molecules protonated. The protonated dye molecules cannot approach the metal ion sites in molecular sieve. The longer distance between dyes and hosts due to electrostatic repulsion decreases the charge transfer efficiency, so the short time ( \u03c4 2 ) in Al-MCM-41 is longer than that in Ce-MCM-41. (2) If the charge transfer in the dye molecules is accessible at dynamics, the relative stable excited state is required. The stable excited state can keep electron retain within PMN molecules. The PET process which occurs between the donor and the fluorophore win the advantage over the charge transfer process from the PMN molecules to the metal ion sites. The electrons incline to be transferred to the acceptor within the dye molecules, not the metal ion sites of host. The prolonged time constant ( \u03c4 1 ) in Al-MCM-41 approves this speculation. 5 Conclusions The naphthalimide derivative is firstly encapsulated into the channels of mesoporous materials. The absorption spectra show that PMN molecules existed in monomer form. The fluorescence emission of PMN in MCM-41 shifts to short wavelength compared with that in solution. Owing to the photoinduced electron transfer process, the emission intensity of PMN molecules in MCM-41 increases with pH value decreasing. The emission intensity of PMN in Al-MCM-41 is abnormally larger than that in Si-MCM-41 and the fluorescent lifetime of PMN in Al-MCM-41 is prolonged. The result indicates that the electrostatic repulsion between the pronated PMN molecules and Al-MCM-41 will cause the decreasing electron transfer efficiency from guest to host.

The materials were prepared by glycol solvothermal method using anatase, nickel nitrate, thiourea as precursor. The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This is the first time to report that NiS is used as a cocatalyst with TiO 2 for the photocatalytic production of H 2. The results revealed that the structure and the amount of the cocatalyst loaded on TiO 2 play important roles in the photocatalytic activity of NiS/TiO 2 composite. The maximum evolution of H 2 was obtained when NiS had hexagonal structure with content in the composite of 7 at% in relation to TiO 2. The rate of H 2 evolution was increased up to about 30 times than that of TiO 2 alone. Copyright \u00a9 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights.",

        "abstract": "In the past decades, TiO2-based photocatalysis has received much research attention as an effective strategy for decomposing the antibiotics in a water system. However, the degradation pathway of antibiotics over TiO2-based photocatalysts has seldom been studied. In this work, Ag\u2013TiO2 was prepared via photo-reduction method and the photocatalytic degradation pathway of sulfadiazine over Ag\u2013P25 under visible light irradiation was explored with the assistance of high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013MS). Based on the HPLC\u2013MS results, the chemical formulas of five degradation intermediates were proposed: one is the product of desulfonating reaction; the second is the product of sulfanilamide bond-breaking reaction; the others are the oxidation and substitution products initiated by \u00b7OH. The contributions of \u00b7O2\u2212, \u00b7OH and h+ during the photocatalytic degrading process of sulfadiazine were investigated by reactive species trapping experiments. On the basis of the above results, it can be deduced that there exist three possible photocatalytic degrading pathways of sulfadiazine, i.e., desulfonation, sulfanilamide bond-breakage and the oxidation of amino groups. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanism of Ag\u2013P25 was also proposed.",

Electron paramagnetic resonance illustrates the presence of oxygen vacancies in W, N co-doped TiO 2 acting as trapping agencies for electrons to produce active species. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of new energy states. New linkages and oxygen vacancies are proved to be the main cause for the improved photo catalytic performances.

W, N co-doped TiO 2 is thermally stable and retains its anatase phase up to 900 \u00b0C. 4.5% W, N co-doped TiO 2 showed superior activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B and 2,4-dichlorophenol as compared to pure titania, Degussa P-25, traditional N-doped TiO 2 and pure WO 3. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The contents of anatase and brookite in the TiO 2 particles have been successfully controlled by simply adjusting molar ratio of tartaric acid to Ti in reaction system. The degradation of Rhodamine B in aqueous solutions reveals that the catalyst containing 78.7 % anatase and 21.3 % brookite has the highest photocatalytic activity.

We successfully prepared TiO2 single crystals exposed with (001) and (110) facets as an ideal support to load the highly dispersed nanosized Au particles to improve the stability of Au on the catalyst surface and expand its photocatalytic applications. The transfer of photoexcited electrons from the higher-surface-energy facet, that is, (001) and (110), to the lower-energy facet of (101) could make the electrons aggregate on the (101) facet and leave holes on the (001) and (110) facets, which would promote the separation of electrons and holes. The highly dispersed Au nanoparticles also could capture the electrons from active facets and further improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Systematic density functional theory calculation was also carried out to investigate the formation of (001) and (110) facets. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen-doped TiO 2 nanocatalysts were successfully synthesized by adjusting a pH range using the ammonium nitrate and ammonia water as the nitrogen source. The samples were characterized by XRD, XPS and UV-DRS. When the total amount of ammonium nitrate and ammonia water was unchanged, different pH values were modified by changing the NH 4 NO 3 /NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O ratio to prepare nitrogen-doped TiO 2 . The prepared photocatalyst showed the highest photo-activity for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) under visible light when prepared at pH 5.87. XPS analysis showed the presence of nitrogen in two states doped in TiO 2 . The results indicated the photocatalytic activity of N-TiO 2 is varied with the change of pH values, the amount of the nitrogen sources and water. The experimental results showed that the higher activity is due to the variation in the concentration and states of nitrogen-doped in TiO 2 . In the preparation methods, the photocatalyst was treated with the hydrogen peroxide before calcination, resulting in the decrease of nitrogen doped into the lattice and the photo-degradation rate of 2,4-DCP. The results suggested that the nitrogen source could be doped into the crystal lattice only in the form of reduction state as NH 4 + ion during the calcination process.",

Ms-TiO2 is designed as an efficient visible light photocatalyst by copper (Cu) impregnation. X-ray diffraction analysis presents the nanocrystalline anatase phase. Cu impregnated Ms-TiO2 (Cu/Ms-TiO2) samples extend the absorption edge to the visible region. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum indicates the mixed valence states of Cu as Cu+ and Cu2+. The beneficial effect of Cu can be explained by the formation of oxygen vacancies with more Cu+ state. Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples exhibit superior visible light photocatalytic activities to Ms-TiO2, P-25 and 2.0% Cu/P-25 in the case of 2,4-dichlorophenol and methyl orange. Efficient charge separation due to the formation of Ti-O-Cu bonding at the surface and the associated appearance of oxygen vacancies together form the reason for higher degradation rate of organic compounds under illumination. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

The results indicated that S-2 molecules interact with the isolated framework Ti 4+ on the internal surface of Ti-HMS and the amount of S-2 introduced increases with the increasing of isolated titanium content.

Methyl orange (MO) and Rhodamine B (RhB) were used to test the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity of the composites was greatly improved after eluting Ag0 clusters from the Ag0/Ag+/TiO2 composites. Interfacial lattice Ag+ cations but not Ag0 clusters are responsible for improving the photocatalytic performance of the composites in this work. XPS measurement shows that the chemical state of the interfacial lattice Ag+ cation is different with the surface chemical adsorbed Ag+ cation. Surface chemical adsorbed Ag+ cation is invalid to promote the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 while Na+ cation can cancel the promotional effect of the interfacial lattice Ag+ cation by competitively occupying the interfacial lattice defects. The 2h turn over numbers of the interfacial lattice Ag+ cations to the degradation of MO and RhB reach 8 and 10, respectively, which show that the interfacial lattice Ag+ cations act as recyclable catalytic sites but not one-time consumptive species. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Iodine doped titanium dioxide has been successfully prepared by simple hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate in the presence of iodic acid. The adopted method allowed for the production of spherical iodine doped titaniun dioxide nanoparticles with varied amount of iodine content. Analysis by X-ray diffraction, Raman, transmission electron microscopy as well as UV-vis DRS revealed that titanium dioxide nanostructures were doped with iodine which existed in two different valence states I 5+ and I -. The iodine in the form of I 5+ is believed to have doped into the lattice whereas I - was well dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 probably as iodine adducts hence rendering it to be highly absorbing in visible light region. The I-TiO 2 exhibited improved photocatalytic activity toward degradation of acid orange 7 (AO7), methyl orange (MO) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) under visible light over the pristine TiO 2 prepared by the same method. High catalytic properties are attributed to iodine doping which led to high specific surface area, absorption in visible region as well as alleviation of charge carrier recombination. The most probable route undertaken in the degradation of AO7 is through indirect oxidation by the hydroxyl radicals. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Synthesis of hydrothermally stable MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve at low cost of CTAB surfactant",
        "abstract": "The hydrothermally stable MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve was successfully prepared at extremely low cost of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) by carefully adjusting the synthesis conditions. The increasing of the crystallization temperature from 373 K to 423 K can dramatically reduce the CTAB surfactant amount for the preparation of MCM-48 from 0.65 to 0.1 of the CTAB/Si ratio. The effect of increasing crystallization temperature on the formation process of MCM-48 at low CTAB cost was carefully studied. The influences of OH \u2212 /Si ratio and fluoride addition to the structure stability of the MCM-48 material synthesized at CTAB/Si = 0.1 and 423 K were systematically studied by XRD patterns. Moreover, the combination of increasing crystallization temperature and adding small amount of fluoride ions can considerably improve the structure stability of MCM-48 when reducing the CTAB cost. Keywords MCM-48 CTAB/Si Crystallization temperature Fluoride Hydrothermal stability 1 Introduction MCM-48 has got high attentions mainly due to its attractive three-dimensional interwoven channel structure; however, its requirement for the high template surfactant cost such as CTAB and sensitivity to the crystallization conditions have seriously restricted its developments in the fields of catalysis, drug loading and separation. Most of the current researches about the application of mesoporous materials have focused on MCM-41 and SBA-15 [1\u201310] . In consideration of the excellent pore structure and to accelerate the application of MCM-48, many researchers have devoted their attentions on optimizing the synthesis conditions for MCM-48 by adjusting the crystallization temperature, crystallization time and adding assistants such as salts or cosurfactant [11\u201314] . Among those challenges for the synthesis of MCM-48, reducing the high CTAB surfactant cost is the most attractive and important one in consideration of the environmental protection. It is reported that adding cosurfactant such as OP-10 can reduce the CTAB amount [15\u201320] . Moreover, using self-prepared GEMINI surfactant instead of CTAB can also prepare MCM-48 at low cost of surfactant [21\u201325] . These methods are all effective; however, it sounds better and is more economic if MCM-48 can be synthesized only by using cheap CTAB as the template instead of adding expensive cosurfactant or using self-made surfactant. In this paper, we reported the results about the specific influence of crystallization temperature to the CTAB amount for the synthesis of MCM-48. It was found the CTAB amount gradually reduced with the increasing crystallization temperature. The combination of increasing the crystallization temperature and adding NaF can form hydrothermally stable MCM-48 at extremely low CTAB/Si ratio. The formation mechanism and the optimum conditions for the formation of hydrothermally stable MCM-48 with low CTAB cost was carefully studied by XRD patterns. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis of MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve The typical synthesis procedure for MCM-48 was as follows: 10 mL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and 56 mL H 2 O were mixed and stirred for about 30 min, and then solid NaOH was directly added to the solution. After that, solid NaF powder was introduced to the mixture and stirred until the appearance of white silicates gel. Subsequently, solid cetyltrimethylammonium bromide powder (CTAB) was added under vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, it was transferred to an autoclave and crystallized at various temperatures. The molar composition for the reactants is as follows: 1SiO 2 : x NaOH: y CTAB:70H 2 O: z NaF, where x = 0.45\u20130.55, y = 0\u20130.65 and z = 0\u20130.4. The solid product (as-synthesized sample) was collected by filtration, dried in air at 353 K and calcined at 823 K for 6 h to remove the template. 2.2 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded on Rigaku D/MAX-2550 diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation of wavelength 1.541 \u00c5. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were taken on a 2000 JEOL electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing a large number of particles in alcohol, and depositing onto a holey carbon film on a Cu grid. Magic-angle spinning (MAS) 29 Si NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker DMX 400 instrument. Data were obtained at 79.45 MHz with 90\u00b0 pulses and 100 s recycle delays using zirconia rotors 4 mm in diameter spun at 5 kHz. The chemical shifts are given in ppm from external tetramethylsilane (TMS). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Reduction of the CTAB amount for MCM-48 The CTAB amount can be gradually reduced by increasing the crystallization temperature. Fig. 1 shows the relationship between CTAB/Si ratio and the crystallization temperature for the synthesis of MCM-48. The crystallization time fixes for 24 h. From Fig. 1 we can find that a well-ordered MCM-48 can be formed at CTAB/Si = 0.65 and 373 K, which is in accordance with the previous report by Monnier et al. [26] . This result indicates that the formation of MCM-48 generally needs high concentration of CTAB. The CTAB/Si ratio decreases to 0.3 when the crystallization temperature increases from 373 K to 403 K, and further decreases to 0.1 when the crystallization temperature increases to 423 K. These results clearly indicate that the increasing of the crystallization temperature is actually favorable for the formation of MCM-48 at low CTAB cost. To study the formation mechanism and determine the optimum conditions for the formation of MCM-48 at low CTAB cost, we investigated the phase transformation processes of MCM-48 samples synthesized at CTAB/Si = 0.1 and 423 K by XRD patterns. The sample synthesized at 423 K experiences the phase transformation process of H(hexagonal phase) \u2192 C(cubic pahse) \u2192 C + L(lamellar phase) \u2192 L within 72 h as seen from Fig. 2 . The hexagonal phase is formed before the crystallization treatment (not shown) and the cubic phase is predominant only after crystallized for 3 h, which turns to the pure cubic phase after another 3 h. The cubic phase is still preserved and the pore structure ordering is greatly improved after totally crystallization for 24 h. However, the cubic phase is not the ultimate phase and is still flexible, which turns to the mixture of the cubic and lamellar phases when the crystallization time is prolonged to 48 h. It finally becomes the pure lamellar phase after crystallization for 72 h. We previously reported that the appropriate addition of fluoride ions can also play the role of CTAB-reduction [27] . Different with the sample synthesized at 423 K, the sample synthesized at the same CTAB/Si ratio with the aid of fluoride ions (F/Si = 1.0) experiences the phase transformation process of H \u2192 C \u2192 C + L \u2192 C within 72 h ( Fig. 3 ), where the cubic phase formed within 6 h gradually change towards the lamellar phase and the mixture of cubic and lamellar phase is formed after 24 h, but the pure lamellar phase does not appear, even by finely varying the crystallization time (see the insert). The mixture phase finally transforms to the pure cubic phase after crystallization for 48 h and preserves to 72 h. The above result indicates that for the formation of MCM-48 with low CTAB cost by adding fluoride ions, the longer crystallization time is favorable to the formation of cubic phase. The above phase transformation processes for the formation of cubic MCM-48 by increasing the crystallization temperature and adding fluoride ions can be explained by their influences to the surfactant packing parameter, g ( g = V /( a 0 )( L ), where V is the total volume of the surfactant chain plus any cosolvent organic molecules between the chains, a 0 is the effective headgroup area at the organic\u2013inorganic interface, and L is the kinetic surfactant chain length). The higher crystallization temperature or the addition of fluoride ions can both accelerate the hydrolysis of TEOS and the subsequent formation of EtOH. The EtOH tends to locate in the outer shell of the surfactant due to their polarity and hydrogen bonding to water [28,29] , leading to the increase of the g value. Smaller g favors the formation of MCM-41 (1/3 < g < 1/2) and larger g favors the formation of MCM-48 (1/2 < g < 2/3). As seen from Figs. 2 and 3 , the hexagonal phase formed in the initial period transforms to the cubic Ia 3 d phase only within 6 h either by crystallizing at 423 K or adding fluoride ions. Unlike the migration process of EtOH to the outer shell of a surfactant micelle, the silicates polymerization process causes the decrease of the negative charge density of the silicate network, which leads to the increase of the surfactant headgroup area and the subsequent decrease of the g value. With more and more Si\u2013OH groups formed by TEOS hydrolysis, the Si\u2013OH polymerization degree and its effect on the product phase are improved. The competition between the effects of EtOH migration and the silicates polymerization on the g value determines the phase transformation process. The reaction in the presence of fluoride ion produces the mixture phase of cubic and lamellar after crystallization for 24 h as seen from Fig. 3 , indicating the EtOH migration further enlarges the micelle volume with the increasing time. However, the reaction carried at 423 K for 24 h does not show the appearance of the lamellar phase, which indicates the silicates polymerization speed is more accelerated at 423 K than that in the presence of fluoride ions within 24 h and the effect of EtOH migration on the g value is negligible. Fig. 4 shows the Si MAS NMR spectra of the sample synthesized at 423 K without fluoride ions for 12 h and 373 K with F/Si = 1.0 for 24 h. The silicates polymerization speed of the sample synthesized at 423 K is actually more accelerated than that with fluoride ions since the sample synthesized at 423 K only for 12 h has similar silicates polymerization degree to the sample synthesized at 373 K for 24 h with fluoride ions. However, the silica polymerization in basic condition will gradually increase the system pH as the reaction further proceeds [30] , which prevents the complete silica polymerization and leads to the reversed silicates hydrolysis. As seen from Fig. 2 , the reaction at 423 K for 72 h finally leads to the formation of the lamellar phase, which is the joint effect of the silicates hydrolysis at higher pH and the EtOH migration. Contrarily, the reaction in the presence of fluoride ions does not lead to the formation of lamellar phase after 72 h. This can be attributed to the strong hydration tendency of fluoride ions, which can effectively dehydrate the hydration layer around silicates network with the reaction proceeding. The silicates polymerization reaches to a more sufficient degree without the hydration buttering and prevents the g increase caused by EtOH migration. 3.2 The influence of OH \u2212 /Si ratio and fluoride addition on the structure stability of MCM-48 synthesized at the low CTAB cost The above results indicate that increasing the crystallization temperature can quickly form MCM-48 with low cost of CTAB surfactant. However, our further studies indicate that the structure stability of MCM-48 material becomes weaker with the decreasing CTAB amount. The sample synthesized at CTAB/Si = 0.1 and 423 K becomes amorphous after the removal of CTAB template by calcination at 823 K for 6 h. This result indicates that although increasing the crystallization temperature can effectively reduce the CTAB cost, the framework of the MCM-48 sample synthesized at low CTAB concentration is greatly weakened. In consideration that adjusting the initial OH \u2212 /Si ratio can change the silicates condensation degree, we investigated the influence of the OH \u2212 /Si ratio to the product phase and the framework stability by fixing the other reaction factors. Since the above sample is synthesized at OH \u2212 /Si = 0.5, we further studied the product synthesized at OH \u2212 /Si = 0.45 and 0.55, respectively. Fig. 5 shows that when the OH \u2212 /Si ratio is set at 0.45, the product is also the cubic phase after crystallization for 24 h, but the calcination treatment proves that the framework stability does not get improved (not shown). Interestingly, when the OH \u2212 /Si ratio is 0.55, the product transforms to the lamellar phase as shown in Fig. 6 . So, the variation of OH \u2212 /Si ratio cannot lead to the formation of structurally stable MCM-48 sample. The silicates condensation and hydrolysis is a base catalyzed process. When the OH \u2212 /Si ratio is 0.45, the silicates condensation degrees of the framework are comparatively low, leading to the poor structure stability. Although increasing the OH \u2212 /Si ratio is advantageous to accelerate the silicates condensation, the structure stability of the sample synthesized at OH \u2212 /Si = 0.5 is not much improved. The sample changes to lamellar phase when the OH \u2212 /Si ratio further increases to 0.55. This is because MCM-48 is the intermediate phase of hexagonal MCM-41 and lamellar MCM-50, which may easily change to another phase. The formation of MCM-48 and the phase transformation to the other phase are influenced by the electronic interaction between silicates and CTAB template, the silicates condensation and the EtOH distribution. In the conditions of OH \u2212 /Si = 0.55, the TEOS hydrolysis is accelerated but the subsequent silicates condensation is weakened since the much higher OH \u2212 /Si ratio leads to the hydrolysis of silicates. The EtOH produced from the hydrolysis of TEOS may distribute between the chains of the CTAB, and the less polymerized silicates leads to the improvement of the g value, thus leading to the final formation of lamellar MCM-50. Therefore, the simple adjusting of the OH \u2212 /Si ratio cannot form the structurally stable MCM-48. Our previous study showed that the appropriate addition of fluoride ions with F/Si = 1.0 can form MCM-48 at CTAB/Si = 0.1 with hydrothermal stability for 12 h in boiling water [27] . This result motivated us to investigate whether the addition of fluoride ions can improve the structure stability of the sample synthesized at CTAB/Si = 0.1 and 423 K. As seen from Fig. 7 , when the fluoride ions with F/Si = 0.1 was added to the synthesis system at OH \u2212 /Si = 0.45, the pore ordering of the sample is greatly deteriorated after calcination treatment. The structure stability is not considerably improved until the F/Si ratio increases to 0.4. When the OH \u2212 /Si ratio increases to 0.5, the addition of fluoride ions with F/Si = 0.1 can dramatically improve the structure stability of the sample synthesized at CTAB/Si = 0.1 and 423 K, which preserves the cubic structure after calcination at 823 K. This sample even can endure the hydrothermal stability in boiling water for 24 h and the pore structure does not considerably decrease until 36 h as seen from Fig. 8 . The above results indicate the structure stability of the MCM-48 sample synthesized at CTAB/Si = 0.1 and 423 K can be greatly improved by adding small amount of fluoride ions. Therefore, the combination of increasing the crystallization temperature and adding fluoride ions can lead to the formation of more hydrothermally stable MCM-48 sample. Fig. 9 shows the particle morphology and the pore ordering of MCM-48 material by SEM and HRTEM. The samples are synthesized at CTAB/Si = 0.1, F/Si = 0.1 and 423 K (a and b). From the figures, we can find that the particles of the above sample have irregular shape and are agglomerated, which is similar to the sample synthesized in the general conditions [30] and indicates the fluoride addition and temperature increase have little influence on the particle morphology. Moreover, the pore is highly ordered as observed along the [0 0 1] (b) direction, which is in accordance with the results from XRD pattern. Therefore, the TEM result further confirms that the combination of increasing crystallization temperature and adding small amount of fluoride ions can synthesize high-quality MCM-48 materials with the low cost of CTAB template. 4 Conclusion This paper shows the result that increasing the crystallization temperature can effectively reduce the CTAB amount for the synthesis of cubic MCM-48. Studies on the formation process for the MCM-48 T 423 K indicate the best crystallization time is 24 h. Further prolonging the crystallization time leads to the formation of lamellar phase. However, the sample obtained is not strong enough to endure the calcination treatment, and the structure stability cannot be improved by changing the OH \u2212 /Si ratio. The addition of fluoride ions is an effective way to improve the structure stability, and the addition amount decreases with the increasing OH \u2212 /Si ratio of the synthesis system. The sample obtained by both increasing the crystallization temperature and adding fluoride ions has higher stability than that synthesized by simply adding fluoride ions.

The XRD results show that ZnFe2O4 can prevent the transformation of titania from anatase to rutile. The magnetic properties analysis indicates that TiO2/ZnFe2O4 is of large saturation magnetization value and low coercivity. The photocatalytic experimental results show that TiO2/ZnFe2O4=3 and 4 are superior in photocatalytic reactivity to other proportions. TEM shows that TiO2/ZnFe2O4 has a fine core-shell fabric. After being used for four times during the photocatalytic reaction, the TiO2/ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles have good photocatalytic stability.",

        "abstract": "The fluorescent dye molecules, 4-piperidine-1,8-naphthalimide, were successfully fixed into the amino modified pore channel\n of mesoporous MCM-41 type materials by in situ reaction of 4-piperidinyl-1,8-naphthalic anhydride with the amino group. The\n formation of amide bonds on the pore surface was verified by infrared spectra. The maximum fluorescence emission peak of this\n hybrid material has a red shift of 13\u00a0nm compared to that of a naphthalimide derivative in ethanol solution. Moreover, the\n fluorescence intensity of dye molecules grafted into Ce-doped MCM-41 is higher than that in pure silica MCM-41. This phenomenon\n is attributed to the inhibited internal electron transfer from piperidine to naphthalimide groups by Ce4+, thus improving the fluorescence intensity of the naphthalimide group. The unique fluorescence behavior of the 1,8-naphthalimide\n derivative doped hybrid mesoporous material makes it a good candidate for the metal ions microdetection.",

The pore structure, morphology, water uptake, hydrophilic nature, degree of geometric swelling, mechanical properties and catalytic properties of the nanocomposite membranes were evaluated.

The techniques of XRD, TEM, SEM, TG/DTA and N2 adsorption-desorption were employed to investigate the structure and formation process of mesoporous microspheres. It was revealed that supersaturated urea not only serve as a reactant and pH modifier in the reaction system but also guide the oriented assembly of hydroxycarbonate crystallites into microspheres by acting as a structure-directing agent. The microspheres of rare earth oxides could easily be obtained by simple calcination of corresponding hydroxycarbonates precursors without undergoing morphology changes. In addition, the influences of rare earth precursor and urea concentrations on the formation of microspheres were also investigated. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The reduced form of W decreased the band gap and inhibited electron hole recombination efficiently. This composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). A series of experiments were conducted to investigate the operational parameters under visible light irradiation such as optimization of nanocomposites wt%, change of pH, reuse of catalyst and initial dye concentration. The kinetics of the dyes degradation was found to follow the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model. Decomposition or mineralization was investigated with the changes of absorption spectra, pH, degradation efficiency and TOC removal in visible irradiation systems. FT-IR spectroscopy of these adsorbed dyes on WO x /TiO 2 powder provided an insight to the mode of its adsorption on WO x /TiO 2 . It was found that the dye adsorbed on WO x /TiO 2 underwent a series of oxidation steps which lead to decolorization and formation of a number of intermediates mainly aromatic and aliphatic acids. These intermediates were quantified by GC/GC\u2013MS.",

        "abstract": "Nano ceria with cubic lattice was prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Degradation kinetics of acid orange 7 (AO7) was investigated to understand the catalytic oxidation mechanism of the CeO 2 with H 2O 2. The degradation of AO7 relies significantly on its adsorption on the surface of CeO 2 with an apparent order of 2.40. Increasing the concentration of H 2O 2 increases the degradation reaction rate constant of AO7 in a positive linear relationship at the initial stage, but later hinders further degradation of AO7 due to over-complexation of Ce 3+ with H 2O 2. The catalytic kinetics of CeO 2 in pre-adsorbed mode (AO7 pre-adsorbed on CeO 2 before the addition of H 2O 2) and pre-mixed mode (CeO 2 pre-mixed with H 2O 2 before the addition of AO7) is quite different. The pre-mixed mode is unfavorable for AO7 degradation, as almost all of surface Ce 3+ are pre-oxidized into surface peroxide species with H 2O 2 and hence reduces adsorption of AO7 as well as the activation of AO7 degradation. Reversely, the reactivity of CeO 2 can slowly be recovered by adsorption of AO7, which competitively adsorbs on the CeO 2 and gradually initiates the release of the surface Ce 3+ by consuming the surface peroxide species. The AO7 degradation kinetics investigation in this work verifies that the degradation of organics in CeO 2/H 2O 2 system is adsorption-triggered and the Ce 3+ in reduced state is essential for activating the catalytic oxidation activity of surface peroxide species. EPR studies show that the surface peroxide species oxidizes the organics via hydroxyl adduct route. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The as-prepared PF/TiO2 samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. PF/TiO2 has similar crystal phase and morphology to raw TiO2 and has significant absorption in the visible region. The XPS observed the presence of Cn, C-OH(C-O-C), and C=O(COO) species, which confirms that there is graphite carbonaceous matter on the surface of PF/TiO2. During the calcination, the phenolic resin on the surface of PF/TiO2 has been carbonized. The photocatalytic performance of PF/TiO2 under visible light was evaluated by the degradation of methyl orange. The photocatalytic activity of PF/TiO2 is greatly higher than that of bare TiO2. The PF dosage for preparing PF/TiO2 with the highest visible light photocatalytic activity is 2%, corresponding to a carbonaceous matter content of 1.33% in PF/TiO2.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the crystallinity of SAPO-34 increases with the increasing F/Si ratio and reaches to the best at F/Si = 0.1. Further increasing of F/Si ratio leads to the decrease of the crystallinity and the ultimate phase transformation to SAPO-5. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that the addition of NaF leads to the formation of floral SAPO-34 while the addition of other salts including NH4F, NH4Cl and NaCl leads to the formation of traditional cubic SAPO-34. N2 sorption isotherm and NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH 3-TPD) analyses indicate that floral SAPO-34 has the largest pore volume but lowest strong acidity compared with other samples with traditional cubic morphology. When applied to methanol to olefin (MTO) reactions, floral SAPO-34 shows the comparable yields of propylene and butylenes to other samples but lowest overall olefin yield, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of the largest pore volume and lowest strong acidity. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

F doping did not significantly change the grain size of TiO2 but greatly enhanced the photo- catalytic activity of the TiO2 film. The optimal doping concentration of F corresponded to F/Ti molar ratio of 0.01. The photocatalytic activ- ity of the FTO thin film was 23% higher than that of TiO2 thin film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results showed that there were two forms of F element in the FTO thin film: surface chemically adsorbed F and substituent lattice F.

The effects of solvothermal temperature, volume ratio of H 2O to C 2H 5OH, amount of NaOH and solvents on the formation of titanate nanostructures have been systematically studied through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At low concentration of NaOH solution (the actual concentration of OH - in the solution is only 0.58 M), different titanate nanostructures are achieved by simply changing the volume ratio of H 2O to C 2H 5OH at 180 \u00b0C and titanate nanotubes can be synthesized between 100 and 180 \u00b0C. A probable formation mechanism is proposed based on XRD, SEM and TEM analysis. The influence of cosolvent on the transformation from anatase TiO 2 to titanate is also investigated. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This work is first time to compare the hydrogen production of the ternary P25/GO/Pt hybrid photocatalysts prepared in different orders. We focus on studying the introduction of GO and find that the quantity of introduced GO and electronic transfer path play an important role in photocatalytic activity on ternary P25/GO/Pt hybrid catalysts.

The single electron in the color center could be produced in BaFCl without Eu 2+. A series of traps of different energy level in BaFCl lattice were formed, and some shallow traps of them could be bleached by Vis-light, and the other deep traps could not. The bleaching effects on ESR and photostimulated luminescence (PSL) were investigated. An F-H-Eu2+ complex (F color center, H color center and Eu2+ complex) in the lattice of BaFCl:Eu2+ was suggested when the phosphor was X-ray irradiated. The Eu2+ located in the complex has only contribution to the ESR signal, but has no contribution to PL spectrum. The excitation of both F-center and located Eu2+ could decompose the complex to induce bleaching. The 440 nm light could excite the F-centers and the 220 nm and 270 nm could excite the located Eu2+, and the excitation disturbed the F-H-Eu2+ complex and caused a decrease of the PSL. \u00a9 2007 VSP.",

        "title": "Synthesis and characterization of high hydrothermally stable Cr-MCM-48",
        "abstract": "The hydrothermal stability of Cr-containing MCM-48 in boiling water was found to be higher than that of the pure silica MCM-48, which was first improved with the increasing Cr content at low Si/Cr ratio, then went to the maxima at Si/Cr = 50, and finally instead decreases with the increasing Si/Cr ratio. The Cr-MCM-48 sample synthesized at Si/Cr = 50 maintained their mesoporous structure after refluxing in boiling water for 36 h. The results of diffuse reflectance UV\u2013vis and ESR spectra showed that the calcined Cr-MCM-48 contains Cr(V) and Cr(VI) at low Cr content. Chromium is present as Cr(V), Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species at the rich Cr content. Both of the Cr positioned on the surface of pore walls and in the framework provide the protection against water attack. Keywords Cr-MCM-48 MCM-48 Hydrothermal stability Chromium Mesoporous structure 1 Introduction A mesoporous molecular sieve, MCM-48, invented by Mobil [1,2] in 1992, has attracted considerable attentions because of its high surface area, ordered pore structure array and narrow pore size distribution. As the adsorbent, catalyst, catalyst support and template for the synthesis of advanced nanostructures, MCM-48 may be the more potential candidate than MCM-41 and MCM-50. However, M41S materials (MCM-41 and MCM-48) have poor hydrothermal stability in boiling water as a result of silicate hydrolysis of the relative thin amorphous silica walls [3\u20136] . The loss of hydrothermal stability could be a serious barrier for the application of this material to water and aqueous solution systems. Because of these limitations, enormous efforts have been made to improve the stability of M41S materials either by changing the synthesis procedure or by modifying the materials after synthesis, such as pore wall thickening [7\u201310] , silylation [11\u201314] , stabilization by salt effect [15\u201317] and hydrothermal restructuring process [18] . Recently, there are some reports focusing on the study or improvement of the hydrothermal stability of aluminosilicate microporous and mesoporous materials. Sano et al. [19] found that the dissolution rate of ZSM-5 in water decreased with an increase of the Al content in the ZSM-5 framework and they suggested that Al incorporated into the framework protected the zeolite framework from hydrolysis. Kawi and Shen [20] reported that compared with Si-MCM-41, the small amount of Al substituted in the framework of Si\u2013Al-MCM-41 was shown to give remarkable improvement of the hydrothermal stability of Si\u2013Al-MCM-41 in boiling water for days. More recently, Mokaya et al. [21\u201324] have shown that incorporated or grafted Al-MCM-41 and Al-MCM-48 have higher hydrothermal stabilities. Additionally, our group has found that the incorporation of Ce into MCM-48 could increase the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 [25] . However, there is so far no systematic study of the influence of Cr incorporation on the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 materials in boiling water. There is also no detailed study of the influence of Cr content on the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48. It is interesting to understand how the Cr content affects on the structure and hydrothermal stability of the mesoporous materials. It is also interesting to compare the hydrothermal stability of Cr-MCM-48 with pure silica MCM-48 materials. In this report, MCM-48 with varied amount of Cr have been prepared and their hydrothermal stabilities in boiling water have been studied using powder XRD and N 2 sorption analysis. Special attention has been focused on the relationship between the Cr content incorporated in MCM-48 and their hydrothermal stabilities. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The reactants used in this study were the tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica source, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant, Cr(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 9H 2 O as Cr source, respectively, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and deionized water. 2.2 Experimental procedure The Cr-MCM-48 molecular sieve was prepared as follows: 10 mL of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) was mixed with 50 mL of deionized water and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 40 min at 35 \u00b0C, then 0.9 g of NaOH was added into mixture, at the same time, the required content of Cr(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 9H 2 O, which is as Cr source, was added. After another 60 min of vigorously stirring, 10.61 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was added to the mixture and continued stirring for 60 min. The molar composition of the final gel mixture was 1.0TEOS:0.65CTAB:0.5NaOH:62H 2 O: x Cr(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 9H 2 O, where x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04. The mixture was heated for 48 h at 393 K in an autoclave under static condition. The resulting product was filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at 373 K. These samples are designated as Cr-MCM-48-( x ), where x is the Si/Cr ratio in the gel. The as-synthesized samples were then calcined in air for 6 h at 550 \u00b0C, increasing the temperature to 550 \u00b0C at 1 \u00b0C/min of heating rate. The procedure of synthesized pure silica MCM-48 was similar to the above procedure, but without Cr source addition after NaOH was added into mixture. 2.3 Hydrothermal stability test 0.1 g of calcined MCM-48 or Cr-MCM-48-( x ) was boiled for different periods of time in 100 mL of distilled water, using a flask equipped with reflux condenser. XRD pattern was obtained after this boiled sample was subsequently filtered and dried in an oven at 413 K. According to the XRD analysis, loss in the XRD intensity, as compared with that of the same sample before the boiling water treatment, was used to judge the hydrothermal stability. 2.4 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded on Rigaku D/MAX-2550 diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation of wavelength 1.541 \u00c5, typically run at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 100 mA. N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were carried out by using Micromeritics ASAP 2010. For BET (Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller method), the as-synthesized samples were calcined following the procedures described in experimental section and the samples were then outgassed to remove moistures and impurities at 623 K for 5 h before measurement. The diffuse reflectance UV\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) spectroscopy was recorded with VARIAN Cary 500. Electron spin resonance (ESR; Varian E-112) spectra were recorded at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis According to Fig. 1 , the basal peaks (2 1 1) and (2 2 0), which can be indexed to Ia 3 d cubic structure, are both clearly observed. Compared with pure silica MCM-48, the resulting materials exhibit XRD patterns with reduced peaks intensity after the introduction of small amount of Cr into the framework of MCM-48. This may be due to the partial structural collapse with increasing Cr content. Additionally, the basal diffraction peak (2 1 1) shifts to higher 2 \u03b8 values with the increasing Cr content, which indicates the d spacing is reduced with the incorporation of Cr. 3.2 UV\u2013vis spectra analysis The spectra of calcined Cr-MCM-48 with different Cr contents are shown in Fig. 2 . The spectra of calcined Cr-MCM-48 with different Cr contents all show two intense bands around 263 and 360 nm. These bands are usually assigned as O \u2192 Cr(VI) charge transfers of the chromate species [26] . A band around 440 nm characteristic of Cr(VI) polychromate is observed in Cr-MCM-48 with high chromium content [26] . These results indicate that high chromates exist in calcined Cr-MCM-48. However, the spectra of calcined Cr-MCM-48-(50) and Cr-MCM-48-(25) contains two typical bands of octahedral Cr(III) at 445 and 611 nm (see Fig. 2 c and d). They have been assigned to d d transitions described as 4 A 2g \u2192 4 T 2g and 4 A 2g \u2192 4 T 1g transitions, respectively [26] . On the other hand, ESR spectra of calcined Cr-MCM-48 samples showed sharp signals at g eff = 1.98, characteristic of Cr(V) in a tetrahedral coordination [27\u201329] . The results are in good agreement with literature, where chromium is present as both Cr(V) and Cr(VI) species [30] . Thus, we assign these optical bands to Cr(V) and Cr(VI) species. Cr(V) is formed by oxidation of Cr(III) during calcination, which is proved by the UV\u2013vis spectra of as-synthesized sample. Fig. 3 shows the UV\u2013vis spectra of as-synthesized sample synthesized at Si/Cr = 100. Besides the absorption of the MCM-48 skeleton (210 nm, not shown), the UV\u2013vis spectra of as-synthesized MCM-48 with Si/Cr = 100 mainly shows two typical bands of octahedral Cr(III) at 445 and 611 nm. There is also the absorption of Cr(VI) at 360 nm, which may be formed during hydrothermal synthesis as a result of oxidation of Cr(III) in a highly basic solution. The Cr(VI) content in the framework of MCM-48 is improved after the calcination compared with as-synthesized sample at Si/Cr = 100 since Fig. 2 shows this sample mainly contains the Cr(VI) spectra at 263 and 360 nm. Therefore, the UV\u2013vis spectral and ESR ( Fig. 4 ) show that the calcined cubic phase Cr-MCM-48 mainly contains Cr(V) and Cr(VI) species under low Cr content. However, chromium is present as Cr(V), Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species under the rich Cr content. 3.3 ESR analysis According to Fig. 4 , calcined Cr-MCM-48 samples with different chromium content show the narrow ESR spectra, which can be clearly assigned to Cr(V). Cr(V) is formed by oxidation of Cr(III) during calcinations since the as-synthesized sample obtained at Si/Cr = 100 only shows the Cr(III) signal at g = 1.97 ( Fig. 5 ). Fig. 4 shows that the Cr species with g \u22a5 = 1.985 and g \u2225 = 1.893 are observed after the samples calcined. The signal with g \u22a5 = 1.985 and g \u2225 = 1.893 is typical of Cr(V) in distorted tetrahedral coordination [31] . This confirms the assignments of the UV and ESR data for calcined Cr-MCM-48 to distorted tetrahedral Cr(V) and Cr(VI) species. Additionally, the ESR intensity of Cr(V) increases with the increasing Cr content, while the line width dose not increase with Cr content increasing. This indicates that Cr(V) is highly dispersed in calcined Cr-MCM-48. 3.4 XRD analysis The powder XRD patterns of pure silica MCM-48 before and after refluxing in boiling water for 12 h are displayed in Fig. 6 a. It is clear that the MCM-48 sample lost its mesoporous structure after refluxing in boiling water for 12 h, which is in agreement with previous reports [5,6,31] . It is known that the structural collapse of mesoporous silica material in water is caused by the hydrolysis of Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds [32] . If the pore walls of the materials are thin or less polymerization, the structure collapses at a relatively fast rate. However, the mesoporous structure of the Cr-containing sample with Si/Cr ratio of 100 still remains even refluxing in boiling water for 36 h ( Fig. 6 b). The low Cr content sample with Si/Cr ratio of 100 exhibits obviously improved hydrothermal stability compared to the pure silica analogue (see Fig. 6 a and b). Fig. 7 shows the powder XRD patterns of calcined Cr-MCM-48 with different Cr contents before and after refluxing in boiling water for different time. According to Fig. 7 a, the mesoporous structure of Cr-MCM-48-(200) still remains after refluxing in boiling water for 24 h, but the structure of Cr-MCM-48(200) is completely destroyed after refluxing in boiling water for 36 h. However, when the Si/Cr ratio decreases to 100 (see Fig. 7 b), the mesoporous structure is still maintained after refluxing in boiling water for 36 h. The similar result can be obtained after further decreasing the Si/Cr ratio to 50. Moreover, the mesoporous structure of Cr-MCM-48-(50) maintained after refluxing in boiling water for 36 h is better than that of Cr-MCM-48-(100). It indicates that the Cr-MCM-48 materials show improved hydrothermal stability in boiling water at higher Cr content. However, when the Si/Cr ratio decreases to 25, the hydrothermal stability drastically decreases compared to the former since the mesoporous structure is almost lost after only refluxing in boiling water for 24 h. From these observations it is clear that the introduction of certain amount of Cr into the mesoporous materials enhances the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 in boiling water. The XRD patterns clearly indicate that the more Cr-rich MCM-48 samples (Cr-MCM-48-(100) and Cr-MCM-48-(50)) are more stable in boiling water than the low Cr content (Cr-MCM-48-(200)) sample. Similar results have been reported by Xia and Mokaya [21,22] in a study on the hydrothermal stability of Al-MCM-48. They found that the dissolution rate of MCM-48 in water decreased with an increase of the Al content in the MCM-48 framework and they suggested that Al incorporated into the framework protected the mesoporous framework from hydrolysis. In this study, we also found that the higher content of Cr incorporated into MCM-48 is advantageous for the protection of MCM-48 framework from hydrolysis. However, when too much Cr is used in the synthesis gel (Cr-MCM-48-(25)), the hydrothermal stability decreases due to the lower structural ordering of parent material. Therefore, according to Fig. 7 , there exists an optimum amount of Cr (Si/Cr ratio of 50) with respect to hydrothermal stability in boiling water. It is also clear that hydrothermal stability of the Cr-containing samples is all higher than that of the pure silica sample. These results can be explained similar to the effect of the Al incorporated into mesoporous materials [21,22] . When Cr is incorporated into the mesoporous materials, Si\u2013O\u2013Cr bonds, which are more resistant to the attack from water than Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds, are formed. In addition, the nonstructural Cr species on the surface can also protect against water attack. However, the higher Cr content drastically degrades the structure ordering of Cr-MCM-48, leading to the decrease of hydrothermal stability. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully control the Cr content to efficiently improve the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48. 3.5 N 2 adsorption isotherms Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherms enable the measurement of the surface area, pore volume, and mesopore size distribution. According to Fig. 8 , the N 2 adsorption isotherms for calcined Cr-MCM-48-(200), Cr-MCM-48-(100), Cr-MCM-48-(50) and Cr-MCM-48-(25) are type IV adsorption isotherms typical of mesoporous solids with H2 hysteresis [33] . Adsorption at low pressures ( p / p 0 < 0.2) is accounted for by monolayer\u2013multilayer adsorption of N 2 on the walls of the mesopores. At a relative pressure p/p 0 between 0.2 and 0.4, the isotherm exhibits a sharp inflection characteristic of capillary condensation within the mesopores. The sharpness in this step indicates a uniform pore size. The pore size distribution curve for Cr-MCM-48-(200) shows a very narrow pore size distribution with pore size 20.7 \u00c5 and high surface area of 1058.7 m 2 /g ( Table 1 ). Cr-MCM-48-(100) ,Cr-MCM-48-(50) and Cr-MCM-48-(25) has a narrow pore size distribution with a pore size of 21.3 \u00c5, 22.8 \u00c5, 23.0 \u00c5 and smaller surface area of 873.9 m 2 /g, 912.6 m 2 /g and 727.0 m 2 /g, respectively. The decrease in the surface area with increasing Cr content is similar to Ga- or Al-containing MCM-41 [34,35] . 4 Conclusion The incorporation of Cr into the framework of MCM-48 materials results in the improvement of the hydrothermal stability in boiling water. Sample synthesized at Si/Cr = 50 has the optimum hydrothermal stability, which can still maintain their mesoporous structures after refluxing in boiling water for 36 h. The results of diffuse reflectance UV\u2013vis spectroscopy and ESR show that calcined Cr-MCM-48 contains Cr(V) and Cr(VI) species under low Cr content. However, chromium is present as Cr(V), Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species under the rich Cr content. The reason for the improvement of hydrothermal stability may be that the incorporation of Cr can form nonstructural Cr species on the surface and the Si\u2013O\u2013Cr bonds, which are more resistant to attack from water.

Titania oligomers hydrolyzed from TiOSO4 precursor can assemble with pluronic P123 to form a large pore mesostructure. The sulfate ions generated by titanyl sulfate forms the hydrogen bonding interactions with the hydrophilic segments (PEO blocks) of pluronic P123. The composites have large pore sizes as compared to the pure sample due to co-assembly of titania oligomers with ammonium and sulfate ions by S0NH4 +X-I + process.

        "abstract": "Ultralong mesoporous TiO 2 -B nanowires were synthesized via a hybrid hydrothermal-ion exchanging-thermal treatment using tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) as a raw material. The phase transformations and porous structures of TiO 2 -B nanowires were characterized and studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption measurement. Mesoporous TiO 2 -B nanowires showed a length of several micrometers and diameter of about 25 nm. The porous structures of obtained TiO 2 -B nanowires were demonstrated by BJH pore distribution measurement.

Microstructure 1 Introduction Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is a well-known wide band-gap n-type semiconductor photocatalysts with high activities for environmental remediation such as air and water purification, water disinfection and hazardous waste degradation [1\u20133] . One-dimensional (1D) nanostructured titania materials, such as nanowires and nanotubes, are particularly significant due to their superior photovoltaic (solar energy conversion), photocatalytic and gas-sensing properties [4\u20138] . TiO 2 -B is the least dense polymorph of titania and the metastable monoclinic modification of titanium dioxide with a shear-derivative of the ReO 3 type structure. Recently, TiO 2 -B was confirmed as promising candidate anode materials exhibiting favorable electrochemical properties [9\u201315] . Several literatures reported that TiO 2 -B nanowires exhibited larger specific charge-storage capacity (335 mA h/g) than TiO 2 -B and anatase nanoparticles [8,9] and more excellent photocatalytic efficiency than P25 and commercial anatase nanoparticles [4] . The first synthesis of TiO 2 -B nanowires by a hydrothermal route was reported by Armstrong in 2004 [8] . Porous structure was regarded to endow nanomaterials such as nanotitania with multiple advantages, e.g. higher mass transfer ability [16] ; many attempts hence were made to prepare 1D TiO 2 and/or titanate nanostructural materials with high pore volume [16\u201321] . In our previous work, TiO 2 -B nanowires with the unique morphologies of pits and dislocations were synthesized via a hydrothermal-ion exchanging-thermal treatment using TiO 2 particles (Degussa P25, which consists of about 30% rutile and 70% anatase, the particle size of which is about 30 nm) as a raw material [22] . The evolvement of pits on the TiO 2 -B nanowires was elucidated in that work, which were however limited in amount and size. Several other raw materials were therefore selected to confirm whether the poor pits can be developed to a possible porous structure in the TiO 2 -B nanowires. Using tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) as a raw material and shortening the hydrothermal treatment time, ultralong TiO 2 -B nanowires with remarkable porous structure were synthesized in this work. Compared to the previous work, TiO 2 -B nanowires obtained here had larger pore volume, smaller diameter and higher thermal stability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials TBOT was chemically pure and obtained from Ling Feng Chemical Reagent. NaOH (analytical reagent) and hydrochloric acid (analytical reagent) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. All the reagents were used as received. Doubly distilled water was used throughout the work. 2.2 Synthesis of TiO 2 -B nanowires Hydrogen titanate nanowires were synthesized in advance by an alkaline solvothermal-ion exchanging treatment. In a typical procedure, 7.0 ml tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) was directly added and compulsively hydrolyzed in the 10 M aqueous solution of NaOH under vigorously stirring. The total volume of solution was controlled up to 75 ml. After stirring for about several minutes the resulting suspension was transferred to a teflon-lined autoclave and heated to 180 \u00b0C for 24 h. After hydrothermal treatment, the product was acid-washed, which involved stirring the sample in 0.1 M HCl solution for 6 h in order to remove the residual Na + ion completely. The material was then filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at 50 \u00b0C for 24 h. In order to investigate the phase transformation and morphology evolution of the product at the conditions of post-heat treatment, the acid-washed product was also calcined at 300, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 \u00b0C for 4 h in air, respectively. Consequently, pure TiO 2 -B nanowires were prepared by heating the acid-washed product at 400 \u00b0C for 4 h in air. 2.3 Characterization XRD patterns were obtained using a powder diffractometer (RIGAKU D/max2550) operating in the reflection mode with CuK\u03b1 radiation at a scan rate of 0.02\u00b0 (2 \u03b8 s \u22121 ). The morphology of the collected powders was investigated using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100 F) operated at 200 kV and equipped with EDX facilities. To prepare the HRTEM specimens, the powder samples were first dispersed ultrasonically in anhydrous ethanol. One drop of the suspension was placed on a carbon film supported on a copper grid and allowed to dry in air before the specimens were transferred into the microscope. Specific surface areas were determined using an ASAP 2020 Micromeritics apparatus following the BET analysis. Adsorption and desorption of N 2 were performed at \u2212196 \u00b0C. Samples had been previously outgassed by heating at 100 \u00b0C under vacuum (3 mm Hg). Desorption isotherm was used to determine the pore size distribution using the Barret\u2013Joyner\u2013Halender (BJH) method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase transition and morphological transformation during TiO 2 -B nanowires synthesis Phase transition and morphological transformation of TiO 2 -B nanowires were characterized by XRD and TEM, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of sodium titanate, acid-washed titanate and the calcined samples. Fig. 1 a gives a XRD pattern, which is very similar to the structural configuration of sodium trititanate; hence, the precise formula of sodium titanate can be denoted as Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 \u00b7 n H 2 O. After H + ion-exchange, the most intense peak of the titanate structure at 2 \u03b8 \u224810\u00b0, which should be ascribed to the (0 0 1) crystal plane shifts to high-angle ( Fig. 1 b), suggesting that the layer spaces of titanates were narrowed as a result of the interlayered Na + ions replaced by hydroniums (H 3 O + ions). The structure of acid-washed product can be identified as the layered hydrogen titanate H 2 Ti 3 O 7 \u00b7 n H 2 O [23] . Layered hydrogen titanate would be converted to TiO 2 -B, anatase or rutile polymorph with the increase in calcined temperatures [24] . The calcined product of layered hydrogen titanate at 300 \u00b0C ( Fig. 1 c) should be identified as the TiO 2 -B phase. TiO 2 -B can be readily distinguished from the anatase structure by the absence of the anatase peak at 37\u00b0 (0 0 4) and from the titanate structure by its broad peak of multiple planes between 28\u00b0 and 34\u00b0 and by the absence of the trititanate (0 0 1) peak at about 10\u00b0 [25] . The main diffraction peaks ( Fig. 1 d) of the nanowires obtained in the typical procedure (400 \u00b0C) are 14.18\u00b0, 24.96\u00b0, 28.62\u00b0 and 48.44\u00b0, which correspond well to the (0 0 1), (1 1 0), (0 0 2) and (0 2 0) lattice planes of TiO 2 -B [26,27] . Besides the lattice planes of TiO 2 -B, the obvious diffraction peaks at 25.22\u00b0, 36.86\u00b0, 37.72\u00b0 and 38.64\u00b0 presented in Fig. 1 e, which correspond to the (1 0 1), (1 0 3), (0 0 4) and (1 1 2) lattice planes of anatase, indicate the coexistence of TiO 2 -B and anatase at 600 \u00b0C and the further development of phase transformation. Fig. 1 f gives a normal XRD pattern of anatase, which means a thorough transformation from TiO 2 -B to anatase at 800 \u00b0C. Finally, Fig. 1 g shows the sample calcined at 1000 \u00b0C to be pure rutile. In a word, the as-prepared hydrogen titanate exhibited the following phase transformation process during the thermal treatment: hydrogen titanate\u2192TiO 2 -B (300\u2013400 \u00b0C)\u2192TiO 2 -B and anatase (600 \u00b0C)\u2192anatase (800 \u00b0C)\u2192 rutile (1000 \u00b0C). Fig. 2 shows the TEM (a) and HRTEM (b) images of the sodium titanate nanowires. Fig. 2 a shows the ultralong sodium titanate nanowires with the length of several micrometers. Fig. 2 b shows that the fringe spacings of 0.356 and 0.832 nm correspond to the (0 1 1) and (0 0 1) lattice planes of Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 , indicating the layered structures of sodium titanate nanowires. Fig. 3 a\u2013c shows the TEM images of nanowires calcined at 300 \u00b0C ( Fig. 3 a) and 400 \u00b0C ( Fig. 3 b and c). The sample calcined at 300 \u00b0C is an ultralong nanowire, which is presented in Fig. 3 a. The length of the single nanowire is several micrometers, but the diameter of a single nanowire is only about 25 nm. In addition, it is noted that the surface of nanowires are not slick so that the coarse profile indicates the incompact configurations of nanowires. The nanowire obtained at 400 \u00b0C ( Fig. 3 b) gives a similar size (diameter of about 25 nm) as those of the hydrogen titanate nanowires and the sample calcined at 300 \u00b0C, which means no obvious size growth occurred. It is worthwhile to note that a great deal of pores with an average size of about 4 nm is presented throughout the nanowires ( Fig. 3 b). Hence, the TiO 2 -B nanowires synthesized from TBOT have higher length\u2013diameter ratio and more compact porous structures. The porous morphologies and the size of TiO 2 -B nanowires are clearly presented in the magnified TEM image of Fig. 3 c, in which the diameter of such nanowires is about 20\u201330 nm and pores with the size of about 3\u20135 nm are well distributed in the nanowires. In our previous work, the diameter of TiO 2 -B nanowires synthesized from P25 was about 50 nm, which is duple to the TiO 2 -B nanowires obtained in the current work [22] . The corresponding SAED pattern of nanowires calcined at 400 \u00b0C are located in the bottom right inset of Fig. 3 c. The central spot is shaded in the pattern in order to give better visibility of diffraction spots. Since the diffraction spots linked in lines can be observed, the linear spacings of 0.358 nm corresponds to the (1 1 0) lattice planes of TiO 2 -B. Fig. 3 d is the HRTEM image of nanowires calcined at 400 \u00b0C. Fringe spacings of 0.317, 0.364 and 0.636 nm correspond well to the (0 0 2), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) lattice planes of TiO 2 -B. The linear diffraction spots shown in SAED pattern ( Fig. 3 c, the inset) and the imperfect lattice fringes ( Fig. 3 d) exhibit the porous structure of TiO 2 -B, which disorders some the crystalline structure of TiO 2 -B nanowires. 3.2 Specific surface area and pore size distribution of TiO 2 -B nanowires The nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and (BJH) pore size distribution curves (inset) of the layered hydrogen titanates (hollow circles) and TiO 2 -B nanowires (solid circles) are presented in Fig. 4 . The hydrogen titanate nanowire gives an S BET of 23.65 m 2 /g, and does not show a special pore size distribution in the range 1.8\u201310 nm. The hysteresis loop at the relative pressure of P / P 0 >0.8 is associated with the pores of size larger than 10 nm, which can be attributed to the intra-aggregate pore of the nanowires [28] . A distinct capillary condensation step can be clearly seen in the nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm of the TiO 2 -B nanowires, giving an S BET of 38.33 m 2 /g, which is larger than the one ever reported [22] . The hysteresis loop is associated with pores that have a maximum distribution at a pore size of about 4.2 nm ( Fig. 4 , inset), corresponding to the unique morphologies of mesoporous structures at TiO 2 -B nanowires. The pore volume of TiO 2 -B nanowires at 4.2 nm of 0.0884 cm 3 /g is much greater than that of the TiO 2 -B reported in our previous work, indicating that the pore volume is greater than that of products synthesized from P25 [22] . The increased surface area of TiO 2 -B nanowire from the hydrogen titanate nanowire may be partly attributed to the formation of mesoporous structures on TiO 2 -B nanowires. Fig. 5 shows the TEM images of nanowires calcined at 600 \u00b0C ( Fig. 5 a and b), 800 \u00b0C ( Fig. 5 c) and 1000 \u00b0C ( Fig. 5 d). Fig. 5 a indicates that the diameter of single nanowire is maintained at 25\u201330 nm. In Fig. 5 b, mesopores at nanowires have been further enlarged and the pore size increases to more than 10\u201320 nm at a temperature of 600 \u00b0C, which indicates that the monodisperse nanowires combined mesoporous structures possessed high thermal stability. Samples obtained at 800 \u00b0C ( Fig. 5 c) also maintain 1D structure, and the subsistence of two holes in the rod indicates that porous structures existing in the nanowires and pores have merged together with the increase in calcined temperatures. The diameter of the nanowires is more than 100 nm, indicating that the aggregation and size growth of the nanowires occurred at 800 \u00b0C. The crystalline phase of sample has completely converted into anatase, and the perfect lattice fringes without any distortions are captured by the HRTEM image located in the top right inset of Fig. 5 c. The square area magnified in the inset clearly shows that fringe spacings of 0.354 nm precisely correspond to the (1 0 1) lattice planes of anatase, indicating that single crystalline nanorods have been produced. Finally, nanowires calcined at 1000 \u00b0C ( Fig. 5 d) show the submicron rod-like structure of rutile. 3.3 Formation mechanism of TiO 2 -B nanowires The formation of TiO 2 -B nanowires with mesoporous structure could be elucidated by the oriented attachment mechanism, which was also proposed in our previous work [22] . The ion-exchange of sodium ions with H + raises internal stress in the interlayers of hydrogen titanate. Numerous works reported that the protonation of sodium dititanate resulted in the convolution of dititanate nanosheets, namely the formation of hydrogen dititanate nanotubes [29] . However, such a convolution is impossible in the hydrogen titanate nanowire of diameter 25 nm in this work; the upheaval of internal stress during the ion-exchange results in the cataclasm of titanate layer. Therefore, the hydrogen titanate nanowires can be considered as the accumulation of primary crystalline units, among which a great number of vacancies exist. The transformation from hydrogen titanate to TiO 2 -B involves an exothermic nucleation and growth step, which results in the formation of a TiO 2 -B-like intermediate. The final TiO 2 -B is formed by a low energy transformation from the intermediate [30] . During the thermal treatment, the reduction of the overall surface energy by eliminating the interface of units drives the oriented attachment [31,32] . Therefore, when the nanowires are calcined at 400 \u00b0C, the vacancies are enlarged by the rearrangement of the primary crystalline units, which leads to the porous structures formed in the TiO 2 -B nanowires. According to the oriented attachment mechanism, the larger single crystallites (nanowires) are then formed due to slight rotation and merging of many small crystallites; consequently the pore size is enlarged with the increase in calcined temperatures. Mesopores at nanowires can be further enlarged to a size of more than 10\u201320 nm at 600 \u00b0C, and are eliminated at 800 \u00b0C to form the single crystallite of anatase nanorods. Using TBOT as a raw material can obtain an improved and remarkable porous structure in TiO 2 -B nanowires compared to the raw material of P25. A probable reason should be ascribed to the different formation kinetics of the sodium titanate nanowires. Once TBOT was compulsorily hydrolyzed in the alkaline solution (NaOH), amorphous titanate was formed by condensing TiO 6 octahedral monomers [33] . The formation of sodium titanate nanowires with high crystallization are thus synthesized by the rearrangement of the amorphous titanate. However, P25 consists of about 30% rutile and 70% anatase, and is highly crystallized. The synthesis of sodium titanate should be synthesized based on the mechanism of dissolution\u2013crystallization at hydrothermal treatment, which process is relatively slower than that of TBOT. Consequently, the sodium titanate nanowires obtained from P25 have a larger size and stronger strength, which result in larger splinters (larger primary crystalline units) when the crash of titanate layer occurs. Using TBOT as a raw material, the primary crystalline units with very small size and more regular distributions could be formed in the acid washing process, which transforms to a remarkable mesoporous structure with higher pore volume in the process of post-heat treatment. 4 Conclusion Ultralong TiO 2 -B nanowires were synthesized via a hybrid hydrothermal-ion exchanging-thermal treatment using TBOT as a raw material. Once TBOT was compulsorily hydrolyzed in the aqueous solution of NaOH, amorphous titanate was formed by condensing TiO 6 octahedral monomers. Ultralong sodium titanate nanowires with high crystallization were synthesized in the hydrothermal process by the rearrangement of amorphous titanate. A mesoporous TiO 2 -B nanowires with a length of several micrometers and diameter of about 25 nm were obtained in the process of post-heat treatment, which had a maximum distribution at a pore size of 4.2 nm, and gives an S BET of 38.33 m 2 /g, were demonstrated by TEM images and BJH pore distribution measurement. The wirelike morphologies and porous structures of monodisperse nanowires calcined at 600 \u00b0C showed little change, which indicated that such nanowires possessed high thermal stability.

        "abstract": "Mesoporous silica with thick pore wall (designated ECT) was synthesized in the presence of fluoride anions by using nonionic organosilicon surfactant (K903) as template. According to the results from XRD patterns and N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption analysis, the addition of fluoride has a strong effect on the pore diameter and pore wall thickness of the ECT samples. 29 Si MAS NMR indicates that the degree of silicate condensation is greatly enhanced by adding fluoride ions. The hydrothermal stability of the mesoporous silica (ECT) synthesized in the presence of fluoride was found to be greatly improved compared to that of the sample without addition of fluoride ions. When F/Si = 0.045, the mesostructure of the sample could still remain after refluxed in boiling water even for 20 days. The ultra hydrothermal stability could be attributed to its thick pore wall, less defects in the silica framework and high degree of polymerization of silicate. Moreover, results from SEM reveal that the addition of fluoride anions also has great effect on the morphology structure of ECT sample. Keywords ECT Hydrothermal stability Mesoporous Fluoride Polymethylsiloxane 1 Introduction Since MCM-41 was firstly reported by Mobil [1] in 1992, many research works have been focused on synthesis [2,3] , characterization [4] and application [5\u20137] of mesostructure materials. One of the most important usages of mesoporous material is as organic synthesis catalyst or the catalyst carrier [8,9] . Because many organic reactions must be carried in aqueous solution and even in steam at high temperature [10] , most of the mesoporous structure would be destroyed during the reaction process due to its amorphous silica wall. The poor hydrothermal stability of mesoporous materials limits its future industry application. Many works have been done to overcome this drawback, such as silylation [11,12] , incorporation of hetero-atom [13\u201316] , addition of inorganic salt [17,18] , using silica nanosphere as framework [19] and transferring zeolite to mesoporous material [20] . Besides the above improvements, addition of fluoride ions is considered as an effective and convenient method to improve the hydrothermal stability. Wang et al. reported that the hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 was conveniently and effectively improved by increasing the crystallization temperature and directly adding NaF to the synthesis gel [21] . As for SBA-15 kind materials, the polymerization degree was found to be the main factor that influences their hydrothermal stability. Zhao et al. employed a carbon-propping and high temperature thermal treatment approach to increase the polymerization degree [22] . This approach showed superior hydrothermal stability in pure steam of 1073 K for 12 h. Generally, mesoporous silica with thicker pore wall is more resistant to the boiling water since although the boiling water appears to gradually peel off the surface layers of silica, the removal of slim layer does not compromise the integrity of the framework [23] . For examples, Jin et al. has synthesized highly ordered SBA-16-type mesoporous silica with thick pore wall by using F108 through two-steps pathway under mildly acidic conditions [24] . Cho et al. reported that hydrothermal stable mesoporous ethanesilica was synthesized through macromolecular templating approach [25] . The mesoporous structural integrity of the solvent-extract sample was maintained for up to 25 days in boiling water at 373 K. But the used macromolecular template (nonionic PEO-PLGA-PEO triblock copolymer) is not commercially available. Recently, our group has synthesized ordered 2-D hexagonal mesoporous silica (ECT) with ultra-thick pore wall from nonionic organosilicon surfactant [26] . Compared with other hexagonal mesoporous silica (MCM-41), the ECT sample has excellent hydrothermal stability due to its thick pore wall. However the used surfactant contains organosilica component. It is difficult to form compact mesoporous silica wall during calcination process. In this study, we added different contents of fluoride ions into the previous synthesis system in order to accelerate the hydrolyze rate and enhance the level of polymerization of silicate species. The hydrothermal stability of fluorinated mesoporous ECT samples in boiling water has been studied by using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The reactants used in this study were the tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica source, sodium fluoride as a fluorine source, K903 as a surfactant, hydrochloric acid solution and deionized water. 2.2 Experimental procedure The fluorinated mesoporous silica molecular sieve (designated ECT) was synthesized as follows: nonionic organosilicon surfactant (K903) was dissolved in hydrochloric acid solution with vigorous stirring. Different amounts of sodium fluoride were added to the above mixture solution. At 309 K, a certain amount of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was slowly added into the above mixture solution. After being added, the mixture was stirred for another 2 h. The mother gel composition was K903:HCl:H 2 O:TEOS:NaF = 1:146:5294:20.6: x , where x = 0, 0.023, 0.045, 0.09, 0.18, 0.36. The resulting mixture was crystallized under static hydrothermal conditions at 393 K in a Teflon bottle for 24 h. The precipitate was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water and air-dried in air overnight. The as-synthesized samples were calcined at 823 K in a flow of air for 5 h to remove the organic composite of the template. 2.3 Hydrothermal stability test The calcined sample (0.1 g) was boiled at 373 K for different period of time in 100 ml of double-distilled water by using a flask equipped with reflux condenser. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to assess the hydrothermal stability. 2.4 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded on Rigaku D/MAX-2550 diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation of wavelength 1.54056 \u00c5, typically running at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 100 mA. N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were carried out by using Micromeritics ASAP 2010. For BET (Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller method), the as-synthesized samples were calcined following the procedures described in experimental section and the samples were then outgassed to remove moistures and impurities at 623 K for 5 h before measurement. 29 Si NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker DMX 40 instrument. Data were obtained at 79.45 MHz with 90\u00b0 pluses and 100 s recycle delays zrconia rotors 4 mm in diameter spun at 5 kHz. The chemical shifts are given in ppm from external tetramethysilane (TMS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on JEOL JSM-6360 LV. The instrument employed for XPS studies was VG ESCALab MK Surface Analysis System (UK) with MgK radiation ( h\u03c5 = 1253.6 eV) operated at 300 W. Raman spectra were recorded on the inVia Reflex spectrometer equipped with an optical microscope at ambient temperature. For excitation, the 785 nm line from an Ar + ion laser was focused. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD and XRS analysis The content of fluoride in the synthesis system is defined as the mole ratio of F/Si. ECT samples with different F \u2212 contents were synthesized to study the effect of fluoride on the quality and hydrothermal stability of ECT mesoporous materials. According to Fig. 1 , all the ECT samples exhibits only one diffraction peak. When the F/Si ratio is low (F/Si = 0.023, 0.045 and 0.090), the peak intensity increases and the width of the peak becomes narrow compared with that of pure mesoporous silica. It indicates that the presence of small amount of fluoride is beneficial to the formation of mesopores, which is in agreement with other report [27] . Table 1 shows that the pore size increases and the pore wall thickness decreases with the addition of fluoride ions with F/Si = 0.023. However, the pore size and the pore wall thickness gradually increase with the increasing F/Si ratio. These results can be explained as follows: The addition of fluoride ions into the synthesis system leads to the enlargement of the surfactant micelle [28] . Moreover, the addition of fluoride will also lead to the formation of Si\u2013F bonds and a progressive decrease of hydroxyl groups on silica oligomers. The amount of silanol groups on the outer shell became fewer and more non-silicates regions were created. It is difficult for silicate oligomers to hydrolyze in deep region of the hydrophilic shell. So the pore size increases and the wall thickness decreases at F/Si = 0.023. However, the addition of fluoride ions can also accelerate the silicates polymerization. So, when the F/Si ratios further increase, the wall thickness gradually increases. As a result, with the increase of the fluoride amount, a 0 lattice value increases from 88.3 \u00c5 (F/Si = 0.023) to 102.7 \u00c5 (F/Si = 0.360). The increase of the F/Si ratio will also destruct the pore ordering of ECT. As seen from Fig. 1 , the structure ordering of the samples synthesized at F/Si = 0.180 and 0.360 drastically degrade. It can be attributed to the overfast polymerization rate of the silicates species accelerated by the large amount free fluoride anions in the synthesis medium, leading to the deterioration of the pore ordering [29] . Similar studies have been shown in the literature in which high quality SBA-15 could not be obtained with F/Si > 0.05 [30] . The data of XPS in Table 1 shows that the fluorine contents of the samples synthesized at 0.023, 0.045, 0.09, 0.18 and 0.36 are 1.17%, 1.21%, 1.57%, 1.23% and 1.13%, respectively. On the condition of low F/Si ratio (0.023, 0.045, 0.09), the fluorine content on the pore surface increases with the increase of the adding amount of F \u2212 . However the fluorine contents of the samples synthesized at F/Si = 0.18 and 0.36 are lower than that of the samples synthesized at F/Si = 0.09. Overfast polymerization of silicate species make fewer F \u2212 ions participate in the fabrication of pore channels. F \u2212 ions tend to remain in the solution, not the surface of micelles. 3.2 N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms The addition of fluoride anions also has strong effect on the pore diameter and the pore wall thickness. As long range ordering of ECT mesoporous samples is kept at low F/Si ratio, the introduction of fluoride can be considered as an effective method to control the pore property of mesoporous material. The nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of calcined ECT samples with and without different fluoride contents are shown in Fig. 2 , which exhibits a type IV isotherm with a H 2 type hysteresis loop. The sharp step in the isotherm reflects the uniform mesopores in all the samples. Table 1 shows that the mean pore diameter of mesoporous silica increases with the increasing F \u2212 concentration in the synthesis medium. It can be explained by its catalytic oxolation properties: the more fluoride added, the faster the oxolation reaction proceeds [31] . The surfactant micelle is formed with a central hydrophobic core made of polymethylsiloxane and a hydrophilic shell. The addition of fluoride will lead to the formation of Si\u2013F bonds and a progressive decrease of hydroxyl groups on silica oligomers. The silica framework which was reticulated on the outer shell by silica oligomers appeared to become more difficult to be linked with hydrolyzed silicate species. Silica oligomers can not enter deeply into the hydrophilic shell, which increases non-silicates region. The more fluoride ions are added, the less silicate species exist in the deep region of the outer shell. During the calcination process, the polymethylsiloxane groups will link with the hydroxyl groups of silica oligomers in the hydrophilic shell. Therefore, the mesopores of all the samples expand from 3.21 to 4.34 nm with the increase of adding fluoride amount. When F/Si ratios are increased above 0.090, the hydrolysis rate of silica species is so fast that silica oligomers can not reach into the outer shell and quickly aggregated on the reticulated silica layer. Therefore, the pore wall thickness of the samples (F/Si = 0.090, 0.180 and 0.360) remained almost the same (about 6 nm). 3.3 XRD analysis of the samples after hydrothermal stability test Fig. 3 shows that XRD patterns of calcined ECT samples with different fluoride amount after being boiled in water at 373 K for various times. According to the literature [26] , the pure mesoporous silica synthesized by using nonionic organosilicon surfactant lost its pore structure after being boiled for 3 days. By adding fluoride ions, the hydrothermal stability of ECT mesoporous silica has been drastically enhanced. When F/Si \u2266 0.090, the mesostructure of the samples can be kept after treated in boiling water at 373 K for at least 5 days. Although the pore wall of the mesoporous samples ECT with addition of fluorides is thinner than that of pure mesoporous silica, the hydrothermal stability of fluorinated ECT samples are enhanced. In the previous reference, Koyano et al. [32] explained high hydrothermal stability of silylated-calcined mesoporous molecular sieve. They divided Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds in the silylated-calcined samples into three types with different stability against hydrolysis: (1) Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds originally present and constituting the wall; (2) those that were formed by the trimethylsilylation; (3) those derived from condensation of trimethylsilyl groups or a trimethylsilyl group and a silanol group on calcination. Only the hydrolysis of Type 1 bonds will cause the collapse of the mesophase structure. In our system, we considered that mesoporous material was silylated in hydrothermal crystallization process. The calcination process may cause condensation of polysiloxane or polysiloxane and silanol groups. The formed Si\u2013O\u2013Si layer protected Type 1 bonds constituting the pore wall. In pure mesoporous silica ECT, the condensation is incomplete and some silanol groups will be generated. The addition of fluoride ions can improve this condensation, which increase the amount of Type 2 Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds. The ultra-high hydrothermal stability of the fluorinated mesoporous samples can be explained by the above reason. As seen in Fig. 3 , the sample synthesized at F/Si = 0.045 exhibits the highest hydrothermal stability. The mesoporous structure of this sample was not completely lost even after being refluxed in boiling water for 20 days. Too high fluoride content in the synthesis medium is disadvantageous to the hydrothermal stability of meseporous ECT sample. Although the mesoporous samples synthesized at F/Si \u2267 0.090 have thicker pore wall, they have poor hydrothermal stability. It is because too fast silica polymerization causes more defects in the pore structure. We found that the sample with F/Si = 0.023 had less fluoride amount, but its XRD peak intensity reduced more quickly. It could be attributed to the less Si\u2013OH groups replaced by Si\u2013F groups and the low level of compactness of mesopore wall. Based on the experimental results, we can make a conclusion that the optimum adding fluoride amount for the formation of high hydrothermal stable mesoporous ECT is F/Si = 0.045. 3.4 Framework structure analysis We previously reported that the pure mesoporous silica ECT sample showed large shrinkage (17.8%) upon calcination, which means that the polymerization degree of silicate is low. If we found a suitable method to enhance the compactness of the pore wall, the hydrothermal stability of mesoporous ECT would be greatly improved. Fig. 4 shows the 29 Si MAS NMR spectra of calcined ECT samples with and without different F/Si ratios (F/Si = 0, 0.023, 0.045, 0.090, 0.180 and 0.360). It is observed that the ECT sample without addition of fluoride exhibits three resonances at \u221292, \u2212101 and \u2212110 ppm, assigned respectively to Q 2 , Q 3 and Q 4 (which stand for [Si(OSi) 2 (OH) 2 ], [Si(OSi) 3 (OH)] and [Si(OSi) 4 ] species) [33] . Here Q stands for a silicon atom bonded to four oxygen atoms forming a SiO 4 tetrahedron and the subscript n indicates the number of other Q units attached to this unit. When the F/Si ratio was at 0.045, it is obvious that this ratio is much higher than that of pure ECT sample. Therefore, we can make a conclusion that addition of fluoride ions can enhance the polymerization degree of silicates. All the fluorinated samples have similar level of silica polymerization. However, as seen from Fig. 3 , the different hydrothermal stabilities of the fluorinated samples can be explained as follows: At low fluoride content, more Type 2 Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds and Si\u2013F bonds with high binding energy improve the resistant ability of the framework to the water attack. At higher fluoride content, more defects were formed in the pore wall due to fast hydrolyze rate of silicate species, which is not beneficial to the hydrothermal stability. As shown in Fig. 5 , Raman spectra indicates that there is a new band centered at 945 cm \u22121 in fluorinated sample (F/Si = 0.045) compared with the sample without adding NaF. This new band is attributed to vibration of Si\u2013F according to the previous literature [34] . Because the binding energy of Si\u2013F bonds is larger than that of Si\u2013O bonds, it is difficult for Si\u2013F to be broken. These \u201ctough\u201d bonds on the pore surface can protect silanol groups from the attack of water molecules. The hydrothermal stability of mesoporous silica can be improved by the formation of these Si\u2013F bonds. 3.5 SEM analysis Fig. 6 presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ECT samples without and with the addition of fluorides (F/Si = 0.09). It is clear that the addition of fluoride ions can influence the morphology of mesoporous ECT. The pure mesoporous ECT is made of irregular mass particles with relative smooth surface. When sodium fluoride was added, the morphology was changed to a bundle of ropes with rough surface. This rough surface is beneficial to be resistant to the attack of water molecules, which makes the sample more hydrothermally stable. 4 Conclusions This report shows that high hydrothermally stable mesoporous silica was synthesized from nonionic organosilicon surfactant by adding certain amount of sodium fluoride. The long range ordering of mesoporous structure can be improved, when the F/Si \u2266 0.090. Excess fluorides caused the replacement of silanol groups and the incomplete polymerization, which is disadvantageous to the formation of high quality mesoporous ECT. Additionally, the optimal condition for hydrothermal stability is F/Si ratio of 0.045. The mesostructure of this sample can be remained even after being refluxed in boiling water at 373 K for 20 days. The high hydrothermal stability can be explained by considering that the fluorinated mesoporous ECT has fluorinated surface, ultra-thick pore wall, less defects in the silica framework and highly condensed silica wall. With the increasing amount of fluoride, the mean pore diameter and wall thickness of mesoporous samples increases. It can be explained by the catalytic oxolation properties of fluorides. 29 Si MAS NMR indicates that the addition of fluoride ions enhances the polymerization degree of silicate species. The addition of fluoride ions also has great influence on the morphology of mesoporous ECT sample. This hydrothermally stable mesoporous material is expected to be suitable for various applications in aqueous medium, such as organic catalysis, ions exchange and adsorbent.

The contents of anatase and brookite have been successfully controlled by adjusting the NaCl concentration and NH4OH/H 2O volume ratio.

The mixed-phase TiO2 exhibits higher activity than pure phase TiO 2, and the product containing 53.4% brookite and 46.6% anatase shows the highest photocatalytic activity. This behavior is explained by the mixed-phase effect between anatase and brookite.

        "abstract": "Bismuth modified nitrogen doped TiO2 nanoparticles have been successfully prepared by two steps synthesis route which includes hydrothermal and impregnation hydrolysis method. Samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physical adsorption, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), Fourier Transmission Infrared (FTIR), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PLS) technologies. The preparatory method afforded the production of well crystallized spherical Bi modified N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with varied amounts of Bi content. XRD analysis results reveal that Bi exists as rare metastable Bi20TiO32 which started to surface at Bi loading content of 7 mol% in relation to Ti ions. All Bi modified N-TiO2 samples exhibited higher photocatalytic activity toward degradation of 2,4-DCP over N-TiO2 under visible light irradiation. The sample with 10% composition of the Bi 20TiO32 exhibited the highest activity. The superior photocatalytic performance of 10%Bi/N-TiO2 is attributed to high visible light absorption as well as effective charge carrier separation. Therefore, the role of Bi species in the N-TiO2 is improvement of visible light harvesting and facilitation of charge carrier separation hence alleviating electron-hole recombination. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve with thermal and hydrothermal stability can be conveniently prepared within only 24 h with the aid of promoter anions SO 4 2 - , NO 3 - or Cl \u2212 (referred as P). The influences of the P/Si ratio and OH \u2212 /Si ratio to the formation of MCM-48 were investigated here, where the P/Si and OH \u2212 /Si ranges were set between 0\u20130.3 and 0.45\u20130.55, respectively. The suitable P/Si range for the formation of MCM-48 mainly depends on the hydration energy of the promoter anion, which follows the order of SO 4 2 - > Cl - > NO 3 - . The lower the hydration energy is, the wider the P/Si range is. Moreover, the P/Si range also varies with the OH \u2212 /Si, which is wider when the OH \u2212 /Si is lower. The thermal and hydrothermal stability of MCM-48 can be considerably improved by directly adding promoter anions to the synthesis gel. The results show SO 4 2 - is the most effective promoter for the improvement of structure stability due to its extremely high hydration energy, which is followed by NO 3 - and Cl \u2212 successively. Each promoter added to the synthesis gel has an optimum P/Si ratio for the improvement of the stability since overmuch addition of promoters obstructs the electronic interaction between anion silicates and cation surfactants, leading to the formation of poor ordered MCM-48 materials.",

The contents of anatase and rutile in the TiO(2) particles have been successfully controlled by simply adjusting the amount of urea in the aqueous phase of the microemulsion.

        "abstract": "The Fenton-like degradation of sulfasalazine solution is studied in this work. The effects of reaction parameters such as Fe(3+) concentration, initial H(2)O(2) dosage and the reaction temperature are evaluated. For sulfasalazine of 100mg/L, the removal of sulfasalazine, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) reached 99.5%, 84.2% and 41% in 60 min with 0.20mM Fe(3+) and 16 mM H(2)O(2) at 35\u00b0C, respectively. The complexed Fe(3+) presents a reaction constant of 0.062 min(-1)mM(-1) while that of free Fe(3+) is 2.526 min(-1)mM(-1) for sulfasalazine degradation. LC-MS technology was used to analysis the possible degradation intermediates. The degradation of sulfasalazine principally begins with the attack of hydroxyl radical on the azo-group as well as the sulfanilamido group. Both intramolecular rearrangement and bimolecular reaction occur simultaneously after the hydroxyl radical attack. Further attack of the active oxidative species results in the cleavage of the aromatic rings and the production of CO(2). The degradation of industrial sulfasalazine wastewater with a COD of 3425 mg/L has also been achieved by Fenton reaction with different dosage of H(2)O(2). Relatively better removal efficiency is observed at moderate Fe/H(2)O(2) molar ratio from 1/5 to 2/5 for industrial sulfasalazine wastewater treatment.",

        "abstract": "A thermally stable SiO(2)-doped mesoporous TiO(2) with high crystallinity was prepared by a templating method. The content of SiO(2) dopant was varied from 3% to 20%. The gels were characterized by TG-DTA analysis. And the resultant catalysts were investigated by various physicochemical techniques, such as WAXRD, Raman spectroscopy, N(2) adsorption-desorption, TEM, FT-IR, and XPS. The WAXRD, TEM, and Raman measurements suggest that the SiO(2) dopant can enhance the thermal stability of the anatase phase remarkably. Rutile phase did not present at all even at 1000 degrees C when the SiO(2) content was up to 15%. N(2) adsorption-desorption results show that the SiO(2)-doped samples have uniform pore diameters and large specific surface area, which is beneficial for photocatalytic reaction. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by degradation of Rhodamin-6G solution under UV irradiation. The results show that the SiO(2)-doped mesoporous TiO(2) have better activity than commercial P25. Especially, the 15% SiO(2)-doped mesoporous TiO(2) exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity than P25 in a large range of calcination temperatures, even at 900 degrees C. The excellent photocatalytic activity of the samples can be attributed to the high anatase crystallinity, large specific surface area, preserved surface hydroxyl groups and mesoporous channels.",

To make the catalysts achieve the highest photocatalytic activity under UV light illumination, the Ag content of Ag@TiO2 was optimized. The results showed that Ag@TiO2-doped Fe3+ extend their absorption into the visible region. Among the Fe3+-doped samples, Ag@Fe-TiO2 with low Ag content showed higher photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination. An excessive added amount of Ag would reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ and make them difficult to be incorporated into the lattice of titania. From the experiments, we found that Fe3+ ions could stabilize the Ag@TiO2 colloid by holding back the aggregation of the core-shell nanoparticles.",

The Ti-HMS samples exhibited a well-defined XRD pattern of typical hexagonal lattice. UV-vis and XAFS spectral for the calcined forms of Ti-HMS indicated that the Ti ions are tetrahedrally coordinated in the framework of HMS for the samples of Ti-HMS(1) and Ti-HMS(2), while at least a fraction of Ti-oxides in Ti-HMS(10) is in octahedral coordination. UV irradiation of the Ti-HMS catalysts in the presence of NO was found to lead to the decomposition of NO to form N2, O2, and N2O at 273 K with different yields and product distributions. The photocatalytic performance of Ti-oxides appears to be completely modified by their incorporation structure and reaction environment. High efficiency and selectivity for the formation of N2 and O2 in the photocatalytic decomposition of NO was achieved with the Ti-HMS(1) having highly dispersed isolated tetrahedral titanium oxide species, while the reactivity decreased with an increase in the Ti content.",

        "abstract": "Cr3+-doped anatase titanium dioxide photocatalysts were prepared by the combination of sol-gel process with hydrothermal treatment. The samples were characterized by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic absorption flame emission spectroscopy (AAS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was confirmed that Cr substitutes Ti 4+ in TiO2 lattice in trivalent ionic state, and the concentrations of dopants Cr3+ decrease from the exterior to the interior of doped TiO2. The photocatalytic activity of Cr-TiO 2 was investigated for the photocatalytic degradation of XRG aqueous solution both under UV and visible light irradiation. Due to the excitation of 3d electron of Cr3+ to the conduction band of TiO2, Cr-TiO2 shows a good ability for absorbing the visible light to degrade XRG. Doping of chromium ions effectively improves the photocatalytic activity under both UV light irradiation and visible light irradiation with an optimal doping concentration of 0.15% and 0.2%, respectively. The special distribution of dopants Cr3+ seems having a good effect on enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Cr-TiO2. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Study on visible light photocatalytic activity and mechanism of spherical Bi12TiO20 nanoparticles prepared by low-power hydrothermal method",
        "abstract": "Graphical abstract Research highlights \u25b6 Synthesiaing Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles within 2 h hydrothermal treatment. \u25b6 Bi 12 TiO 20 has spherical structures with good dispersion and high BET surface area. \u25b6 Bi 12 TiO 20 has a high activity under visible light irradiation. \u25b6 The photocatalytic mechanisms were identified. Abstract Bismuth titanate (Bi 12 TiO 20 ) nanoparticles with spherical structures and good dispersion were synthesized hydrothermally using C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O and TiCl 3 in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Only 2 h of hydrothermal process was needed which means the whole process of preparation was a less power consumption. X-ray diffraction (XRD) proved that the samples were in pure cubic phase. UV\u2013vis diffuse reflection spectra showed the band gap of Bi 12 TiO 20 is about 2.65 eV. Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) analysis showed that the Bi 12 TiO 20 samples have higher surface areas. Visible-light-induced photodegradation of acid orange 7 (AO7) on Bi 12 TiO 20 was investigated. It was found that Bi 12 TiO 20 -assisted photocatalytic degradation of AO7 occurs via two processes: the photocatalytic process of Bi 12 TiO 20 semiconductor and the photosensitized process of AO7. Photocatalytic experiments in the presence of N 2 and the radical scavenger suggested that OH and O 2 \u2212 are two main active species in the whole degradation process. Keywords Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles Ammonium Bismuth Citrate Acid orange 7 Photocatalytic degradation Active species 1 Introduction Environmental pollution and energy shortage are two of the most important problems which the mankind faces now. Since the discovery of the photocatalytic splitting of water on the TiO 2 electrodes by Fujishima and Honda [1] , the applications of semiconductor photocatalysts on solar energy conversion and degradation of pollutants have received great attention [2\u20135] . After about 40 years of research, the photocatalytic technology has been proved to be a promising method in solving energy and environmental problems. Among all the photocatalysts, TiO 2 attracts the most attention because of its chemical stability, nontoxicity, and high photocatalytic reactivity [6\u20138] , however, the band gap of the TiO 2 is 3.2 eV. It absorbs only the ultraviolet light ( \u03bb < 400 nm), which only accounts for about 4% of the sunlight [9] . In order to improve the efficiency of the sunlight utilization, the development of visible-light-driven and stable oxide photocatalysts is highly desirable. To find a breakthrough, it is indispensable to control the valence band with orbitals of some elements instead of O2p. It has been found that bismuth is a potential candidate for such a valence band control element [10,11] . Recently, ternary bismuth oxide semiconductors, such as Bi 2 WO 6 [12,13] , BiVO 4 [14,15] , NaBiO 3 [16] and Bi 12 TiO 20 [17,18] have been widely studied as a class of promising photocatalysts which can respond under visible light. The Bi 12 TiO 20 crystals belong to a family of sillenite compounds with the general formula Bi 12 MO 20 where M represents a tetravalent ion or a combination of ions, which gives an average charge of 4+. The frame-work of Bi 12 TiO 20 is formed by Bi\u2013O polyhedra, where Bi ions are coordinated with five oxygen ions that form an octahedral arrangement together with the stereochemically active 6s 2 lone electron pair of Bi 3+ [19] . The unique structure of Bi 12 TiO 20 is benefit for its application in the photocatalysis field. As a result, Bi 12 TiO 20 has received more and more attention as a photocatalytic material. Our group [20] has reported the hydrothermal preparation of Bi 12 TiO 20 in recent. In that system, Bi(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b75H 2 O was used as the Bi source while Ti(SO 4 ) 2 was used as the Ti source. Pure cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 (the products were named n-Bi 12 TiO 20 ) can be obtained when the reaction solution was hydrothermally treated at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using PEG10000 as cosolvent. The as-prepared n-Bi 12 TiO 20 samples were nano-sized particles with 13.5 m 2 /g of BET surface area. The agglomeration phenomenon can be observed in those samples. Therefore, the original hydrothermal method is not suitable to synthesize the Bi 12 TiO 20 samples with good dispersion. Thus, the synthesis of visible-light-driven Bi 12 TiO 20 photocatalysts with controlled microstructure and improved photocatalytic efficiency is a subject of considerable research interest. In this work, we have successfully synthesized Bi 12 TiO 20 with good dispersion and uniform spherical morphology using Ammonium Bismuth Citrate (C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O) as Bi source material and TiCl 3 as the Ti source material. PEG in this hydrothermal system acts as cosolvent. In addition, using Bi 12 TiO 20 sample as photocatalyst, we have investigated in detail its catalytic efficient of acid orange 7 (AO7) degradation under visible light irradiation. We offer the first opportunity to research the possible photocatalytic mechanism of Bi 12 TiO 20 under visible light. 2 Experiment 2.1 Materials Titania P-25 (TiO 2 ; ca. 80% anatase, 20% rutile; BET area, ca. 50 m 2 /g) was supplied by Degussa Co. Ammonium Bismuth Citrate (C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O) was purchased from Aladdin Co. while AO7 was obtained from Acros and used without further purification. Other major reagents were of analytical purity and supplied by China National Medicines Corporation. Double distilled water was used throughout this study. 2.2 Preparation of Bi 12 TiO 20 photocatalysts All samples were prepared by a standard procedure. Typically, 2.5 mmol of C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O were dissolved in 10 mL 20% (volume ratio) HNO 3 . 0.208 mM (Bi:Ti = 12:1) of different Ti source material (such as Ti(SO 4 ) 2 , TiCl 3 , TiCl 4 , Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 ) were dissolved in 5 mL of double distilled water. Aqueous solutions of Bi source material and Ti source material were mixed together and then vigorous stirred for 1 h. The 0.9 g PEG10000 were dissolved into 10 mL of double distilled water and added dropwise into the reaction solution. One mole of NaOH aqueous solution was also added slowly to adjust the pH. Afterward, this suspension was stirred for 30 min and then transferred into a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave up to about 80% of its capacity. The autoclave was kept at 180 \u00b0C for different time and cooled to room temperature after the reaction time. The precipitates were washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times and then dried at 100 \u00b0C for 2 h to obtain the final products. 2.3 Characterization of Bi 12 TiO 20 photocatalysts The powder X-ray diffraction analysis of the prepared catalyst was carried out at room temperature with a Rigaku D/max 2550 VB/PC apparatus using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) and a graphite monochromator, operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The BET of the sample was determined through nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2010). The sample was degassed at 473 K before the measurement. The UV\u2013vis absorbance spectra were recorded for the dry-pressed disk sample using a Scan UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary 500) equipped with an integrating sphere assembly. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the samples was done using a JSM-2100F (JEOL) instrument and the electron beam accelerating voltage was 200 kV. 2.4 Photocatalytic activities test The photocatalytic degradation of AO7 with visible light was used to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the samples. A 1000 W halogen lamp was used as the light source with a 420 nm cutoff filter to provide visible light irradiation. During the reaction, a water-cooling system cooled the water-jacketed photochemical reactor to maintain the solution at 25 \u00b0C. In each experiment, 0.08 g of photocatalyst was added to 80 mL of AO7 solution (20 mg/L). Before illumination, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure the adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and AO7. Then the solution was exposed to visible light irradiation under magnetic stirring. At given time intervals, 4 mL of suspension was sampled and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst particles. Then, the catalyst-free dye solution were analyzed by a Cary 100 UV\u2013vis spectrometer to record intensity of the maximum band at 484 nm in the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles The phase and composition of the products were investigated by XRD measurements. Different Ti sources are used in this work in order to determine the application scope of this hydrothermal system. Fig. 1 A shows the XRD spectra of the samples prepared using four kinds of Ti sources: TiCl 4 , Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 , Ti(SO 4 ) 2 and TiCl 3 . Compared with the JCPDS Card No. 34-0097, the Standard Card of cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 , all diffraction peaks of four curves can be indexed to cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 . In other words, four different kinds of Ti sources can be used to prepare cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 when the reaction solution is hydrothermally treated for 8 h at 180 \u00b0C. The hydrothermal system using C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O as Bi source is universal to different Ti sources which is benefit for the promotion of the hydrothermal method. Fig. 1 B shows the XRD spectra of samples prepared using different Ti sources with 2 h of hydrothermal treatment at 180 \u00b0C. As seen in curves b, c and d, peaks observed at 32.0\u00b0 and 46.8\u00b0 do not belong to the peaks of cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 . So using TiCl 4 , Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 or Ti(SO 4 ) 2 as Ti sources, 2 h of hydrothermal time is not enough for the formation of pure cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 . When TiCl 3 was used as Ti source, pure Bi 12 TiO 20 can be obtained at 180 \u00b0C after 2 h of hydrothermal treatment. All Ti sources are first dissolved in double distilled water without other solvents. However, the Ti(SO 4 ) 2 is slightly soluble in water while TiCl 4 and Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 will precipitate in double distilled water. These two phenomena are not conducive to the following reaction. TiCl 3 can be evenly mixed with double distilled water producing lots of Ti 3+ to react with Bi 3+ . The using TiCl 3 as Ti source can shorten the hydrothermal time which means it is the best choice among four Ti sources. To reveal the effect of hydrothermal treatment time on the Bi 12 TiO 20 , time-dependent experiments were carefully conducted. TiCl 3 was used as Ti source. Fig. 1 C shows the XRD spectra of samples synthesized with different hydrothermal time. In the preparation of pure sillenite Bi 12 TiO 20 , main peaks of cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 have been found when hydrothermal time was only 1 h. But a metastable phase (bump at about 28.0\u00b0) also appeared which means 1 h hydrothermal time is not enough for the formation of pure cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 . Pure cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 was finally obtained with 2 h of hydrothermal treatment. After the hydrothermal treatment was proceeded to 8 h, the peak intensity got stronger which showed the crystallinity of the sample was developing with the prolongation of hydrothermal time. FT-IR spectra of prepared samples are showed in Fig. 2 . As reported by previous papers [21,22] , the cubic Bi 12 TiO 20 has four peaks at 457, 535, 586 and 663 cm \u22121 , corresponding to the characteristic peaks of sillenite having Bi\u2013O vibration modes. As shown in Fig. 2 A, all of the four characteristic peaks can been observed in the samples with 8 h of hydrothermal treatment at 180 \u00b0C using different Ti sources. But when the hydrothermal time is just 2 h ( Fig. 2 B), the four peaks are not very obvious in the sample using TiCl 4 as Ti source. This result is in good agreement with the XRD results discussed above. The UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-synthesized Bi 12 TiO 20 (PEG10000, hydrothermal temperature: 180 \u00b0C; hydrothermal time: 2 h; pH = 12.5) is shown in Fig. 3 . As a comparison, the spectra of P-25 titania were also measured. The absorption edge of the Bi 12 TiO 20 sample extended nearly to the whole spectra of visible light, which implies the possibility of high photocatalytic activity of this material under visible light. In compared with P-25, the absorption onset wavelength of Bi 12 TiO 20 was shifted 100 nm to visible region. The color of synthesized Bi 12 TiO 20 was deep green, which was in accordance with its absorption spectrum. It is well-known that for a crystalline semiconductor [23] , the optical absorption near the band edge follows the formula: (1) \u03b1 h \u03bd = A ( h \u03bd \u2212 Eg ) n / 2 where \u03b1 , h , \u03bd , Eg, and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, the light frequency, the band gap, and a constant, respectively. Among these, n describes the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor. For Bi 12 TiO 20 , the value of n is 1. The plot of ( \u03b1h\u03bd ) 2 vs. h\u03bd based on the direct transition is shown in the inset of Fig. 3 . Therefore, the energy of the band gap could be estimated to be about 2.65 eV for Bi 12 TiO 20 in our case. This indicates that the nanosized Bi 12 TiO 20 has a suitable band gap for photocatalytic decomposition of organic contaminants under visible light irradiation. The morphology and microstructure of Bi 12 TiO 20 samples prepared under the best hydrothermal condition (Ti: TiCl 3 ; T : 180 \u00b0C; t : 2 h) were revealed by TEM images ( Fig. 4 A\u2013C ). The panoramic views shown in Fig. 4 A and B indicate that the as-prepared products are composed of sphere structures. The good dispersion of these samples shows the using C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O as Bi source can control the agglomeration at a large extent. As shown in Fig. 4 C which is the HRTEM image of Bi 12 TiO 20 sample, the Bi 12 TiO 20 samples were spherical in shape and less than 10 nm in size. The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface areas of Bi 12 TiO 20 prepared under different condition were shown in Table 1 . When the hydrothermal time was kept in 8 h, the sample prepared using TiCl 3 as Ti source had the larger BET surface area in compared with samples synthesizing using three other Ti sources. The largest BET surface area of the sample can reach to 21.95 m 2 /g, higher than n-Bi 12 TiO 20 (13.50 m 2 /g) [20] . The combination of C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O and TiCl 3 can increase the BET surface area in compared with the Bi(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b75H 2 O and Ti(SO 4 ) 2 . 3.2 The role of Ammonium Bismuth Citrate In previous research, Bi(NO 3 ) 3 is typically used as the Bi source in the preparation of Bi 12 TiO 20 [20] . As shown in formula (2) , Bi(NO 3 ) 3 can be fully ionized in acidic solution and produce great amount of Bi 3+ . When NaOH aqueous solution was added in the reaction solution, lots of Bi 3+ can react with Ti 4+ and produce white precipitate immediately. This kind of quick reaction is the reason why agglomeration phenomenon is serious when using Bi(NO 3 ) 3 as Bi source. When C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 instead of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 is selected as the Bi source in this new system, the reaction solution kept transparent under stirring even after adding the NaOH aqueous solution. C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 is one of the metal chelates which can produce the complex of Bi 3+ with citric anions, as shown in formula (3) [9] . Because of the coordination, Bi 3+ will not directly react with Ti 4+ and the precipitate will not appear when the reaction is in normal temperature. As the temperature increased during the hydrothermal process, the complex will gradually decompose and release Bi 3+ slowly, followed by the reaction with Ti 4+ . Thus, the nucleation and growth process of Bi 12 TiO 20 occur slowly during the hydrothermal process, which might be similar to that in homogeneous precipitation. In this precipitation process, the microstructure of the product is dominantly controlled by the nucleation and anisotropic growth of the Bi 12 TiO 20 ; thus small particles will be obtained using C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 as Bi source. In addition, this kind of reaction in a homogeneous solution is benefit for shortening the hydrothermal time and achieving the low-power preparation of Bi 12 TiO 20 . As shown in our previous research [20] , PEG10000 works as a template. Lots of spherical particles were obtained using long-chain PEG, which is due to the fact that a long-length PEG can confine more than one direction of the growing colloid and finally form spherical colloids [24] . As a result, Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles with spherical morphology and higher surface area are obtained.

For comparison, the photodegradation of AO7 by P-25 was also carried out. The results displayed in Fig. 5 show that AO7 solution was stable under visible light irradiation in the absence of any photocatalyst. Keeping the AO7 solution in neutral condition, when using Bi 12 TiO 20 as the photocatalyst, total degradation rate of AO7 was over 75% within 6 h irradiation, much higher than the P-25 which only reached 25% of the total decomposition. The solution pH has great influence on the surface charge of the semiconductor photocatalyst, which will also affect the degradation result. The photodegradation of AO7 over Bi 12 TiO 20 with different initial pHs is showed in Fig. 6 A . The photodegradation rate of the AO7 dye increased when the pH of solution changed from 6.0 to 4.0. It is well known that AO7 is a kind of anionic dyes. The acidic environment is helpful to increase adsorption of AO7 on the Bi 12 TiO 20 surface [25] and thus, indirectly, the photocatalytic decomposition rate of AO7. As a result, total degradation rate of AO7 was over 90% within 6 h irradiation when the pH of solution was kept at 4.0. In previous study, it has been proved the BET surface area of Bi 12 TiO 20 is an important factor in the degradation of AO7 [20] . On the one hand, the higher surface area can increase the amount of adsorption of AO7. On the other hand, higher BET surface area provides more active sites for photocatalytic reaction [26] . As shown in Table 1 , the hydrothermal time can influence the BET surface at a large degree. Therefore, the photocatalytic results of Bi 12 TiO 20 prepared under different hydrothermal time are shown in Fig. 6 B. The sample with the largest BET surface area (21.95 m 2 /g) has the best photocatalytic activity. In conclusion, the shorting hydrothermal time increases the BET surface area of Bi 12 TiO 20 , and then improves the photocatalytic result of sample. The repeatability of visible photocatalytic activity for the Bi 12 TiO 20 samples prepared using C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 as Bi source was investigated. It is apparent that the degradation curves are very close to each other within five times, implying the excellent stability of photocatalytic activity for the Bi 12 TiO 20 samples. Thus, the Bi 12 TiO 20 samples can be reused many times without diminution in photocatalytic activity, which extends the practical application of TiO 2 . 3.4 Photocatalytic mechanism of AO7 by Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles Professor Zhu and coworkers [11] have proposed that photocatalytic process and photosensitized process effected together in the degradation of RhB by Bi 2 WO 6 . In our experiment, the photocatalytic process of Bi 12 TiO 20 semiconductor is confirmed by degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). Fig. 7 shows the photocatalytic results of 2,4-DCP by the Bi 12 TiO 20 prepared under the best hydrothermal conditions (Ti: TiCl 3 , T = 180 \u00b0C, t = 2 h). The adsorption capacity (only 2.5%) on Bi 12 TiO 20 of 2,4-DCP is limited. After 6 h visible light irradiation, the total degradation rate reached 25%. 2,4-DCP dissolved in water will form a colorless solution and this solution is very stable under light irradiation. Because photosensitized process cannot occur in a colorless solution under visible light irradiation, the degradation of 2,4-DCP can only be attributed to the photocatalytic activity of Bi 12 TiO 20 . This experimental result proves that the Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles have the photocatalytic ability under visible light in the degrading process of AO7. Consequently, the photocatalysis process also exists in the decoloration of AO7. A large amount of adsorption of AO7 might influence the research on the photocatalytic mechanism of Bi 12 TiO 20 , so the AO7 solution of pH = 6.0 was adopted in the following photocatalytic experiments. In order to determine the main active species responsible for the degradation of AO7, comparison experiments in N 2 atmosphere and scavenger-loaded condition were undertaken. The AO7 solution with Bi 12 TiO 20 photocatalyst was sealed and purged with N 2 for 1 h before irradiation to drive out a part of dissolved oxygen and kept purging on until the reaction was completed. As seen in Fig. 8 , the result is that the degradation rate in the air equilibrium condition is 76%, much higher than in the N 2 equilibrium condition which is only about 7%. The 7% of degradation rate might be attributed to the absorption of AO7 on the Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles before the visible light irradiation. The result that AO7 cannot be degraded on Bi 12 TiO 20 under N 2 -purged condition indicates oxygen is the main source of the active species. As shown in formula (4), (5) and (6) , O 2 \u2212 , HO 2 and OH are three possible oxidative intermediate species formed from the O 2 [27,28] . According to formula (7) , HO 2 is unstable and automatically generate O 2 and H 2 O 2 . So the role of HO 2 will not discussed in this research. The degradation results of AO7 in the presence of methanol (CH 3 OH, a quencher of OH in the solution [29] ) and KI (a quench of positive holes (h + ) and OH radical on catalyst surface [30,31] ) are shown in Fig. 9 . Adding 50 mM of CH 3 OH in the AO7 solution, the degradation rate decreased from 76% to 50%, showing the OH in the solution can affect the degradation result of AO7. When 2 mM of KI was added into the AO7 solution, the degradation rate decreased from 76% to 30%. Because of the bad result in degrading AO7 in the N 2 equilibrium condition, the positive (h + ) holes is not the main active species. So the OH radical on catalyst surface is the main oxidative species responsible for the degradation of the AO7 dye solution. In conclusion, OH radical is the most important active species in the photocatalytic process of AO7 by Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles.

The whole degradation process consists of two parts: the photocatalytic activity of Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles and the photosensitized process of AO7. As seen in following formulas, four main reactions are involved in the photocatalytic process: (1) Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles produced h + and e \u2212 under light irradiation (as seen in formula (8) ); (2) O 2 reacted with e \u2212 and formed the superoxide (O 2 \u2212 ) and h + reacted with \u2013OH group absorbed on surface of Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles (as seen in formula (4) and (9) ); (3) further reaction of O 2 \u2212 produced OH (as seen in formula (6) ); (4) OH and O 2 \u2212 worked together to degrade AO7 into small molecules (as seen in formula (10) ). (8) B i 12 TiO 20 + h \u03bd \u2192 h + + e \u2212 O 2 + e \u2212 \u2192 O 2 \u2212 O 2 \u2212 + e \u2212 + 2 H + \u2192 H 2 O 2 \u27f6 e \u2212 OH + O H \u2212 (9) h + + OH \u2212 \u2192 OH (10) O 2 \u2212 / OH + AO 7 \u2192 degraded products In the photosensitized process, the AO7 dye first absorbed the incident photo flux. Then, the photogenerated electrons were transferred to the excited state of the dye. The photoelectrons of the excited state were immediately injected into the CB of Bi 12 TiO 20 . The photoelectrons in the CB were then captured by O 2 and formed the O 2 \u2212 which can lead to the mineralization of the dyes (as seen in formula (11)\u2013(14) ).

OH and O 2 \u2212 are two main active species in the whole process. 4 Conclusions Bi 12 TiO 20 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized under only 2 h hydrothermal treatment using C 6 H 13 BiN 2 O 7 as Bi source and TiCl 3 as Ti source. The as-prepared Bi 12 TiO 20 samples were composed of spherical structures with good dispersion and high BET surface area. The optical band gap of Bi 12 TiO 20 samples were estimated to be about 2.65 eV which showed Bi 12 TiO 20 can respond to the visible light. Visible-light-induced degradation of AO7 showed Bi 12 TiO 20 had a high activity for the AO7 degradation. The photocatalytic process of Bi 12 TiO 20 and the photosensitized process of AO7 were identified to exist in the degradation process of AO7 under visible light irradiation. The radical scavenger technologies suggest that OH and O 2 \u2212 took part in Bi 12 TiO 20 photocatalysis.

        "abstract": "Ce-intercalated layered titanate (CeTO) was synthesized through an ion-exchange process combined with thermal treatment. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the interlayer shrinkage, lattice cell contraction and lattice dislocation of CeTO occur during the ion-exchange process. The ion-exchange process lengthens the bond length of Ti\u2013O in the a -axis direction, which results in a bathochromic shift of titanate in UV\u2013vis spectrum. Calcination treatment intensifies the interlayer shrinkage and reduces the lattice dislocation via lattice rearrangement. The photocatalytic reactivity of CeTO is significantly improved with thermal treatment at 400 \u00b0C. EPR study shows that most of the intercalated cerium ions are oxidized to Ce 4+ after intercalation, while thermal treatment changes little the chemical valence of cerium ion. It is suggested that lattice dislocation but not chemical valence of cerium ion plays an important role in determining the photocatalytic activity of CeTO. Further, the photocatalytic reactivity of CeTO is much higher than cerium doped sodium titanate prepared by solid-state reaction (SSR) method.",

The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts was evaluated in terms of the degradation of methyl orange (MO). The physical features of the catalysts were measured with XRD, BET and HRTEM techniques. The phase content of brookite and anatase in the TiO2 can be controlled by fixing the concentration of the electrolyte in the hydrothermal system. The as-formed Ag0 clusters have an average diameter of ca. 1.5 nm and intersperse throughout the surface of both anatase nanoparticles and brookite nanorods. Ag0 has an optimal loading dosage of 2.0 mol%, with which the photocatalytic degradation of MO are 4.82 and 2.28 times of that with Ag0-free composite and P25 TiO2, respectively. The synergistic effect of hetero-junction in brookite/anatase composite and the schottky barrier at the interface of Ag0 and TiO2 significantly improved the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes under UV irradiation and thus resulted in a much enhanced photocatalytic reactivity towards the degradation of MO. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

Iron oxide in the Fe-4A composite appeared in \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 phase and was highly dispersed on the surface of 4A zeolite. Fe-4A composite effectively degraded Orange II under acidic and neutral conditions via sono-Fenton process. 4A-zeolite promoted the production of cavitation bubbles under ultrasonic treatment, while \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 promoted the homolysis of oxygen molecule producing hydroxyl radical and high-valent iron-oxo species. Both actions benefited the sono-Fenton reactivity of Fe-4A. Fe-4A-4 composite with a practical \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 content of 24.9% showed the maximum sono-Fenton reactivity to Orange II. Dissolved iron ion measurement showed that Fe-4A composite represented a low iron ion dissolution-level, while the repeatability test of recycled Fe-4A showed that Fe-4A composite has high reactivity stability and a long life-time under neutral condition in the sono-Fenton reaction.",

The results indicate Ti-HMS to be a good photocatalyst with a continuous reactivity under prolonged irradiation. The direct decomposition of NO into N2, O2, and N2O at 275 K with a high selectivity for N2 and O2 in a closed system is noteworthy. In situ photoluminescence and EXAFS investigations show that the Ti exists in a tetrahedral coordination and is highly dispersed within the mesoporous material. The TPD studies, before and after the photocatalytic investigations, clearly indicate that NO molecules cannot be adsorb strongly on the surface of Ti-HMS photocatalysts, in contrast to the powdered TiO2 photocatalysts, where strong NO adsorption species have been observed. It is likely that the charge transfer excited state of the tetrahedrally coordinated titanium oxide species plays a significant role in the direct decomposition of NO.",

By selecting photocatalytic degradation of acid orange 7 (AO7) as a probe reaction, the influences of calcination temperature of catalyst, the concentration of AO7, initial pH value of AO7 solution and catalyst dosage on the photocatalytic activity of CeO 2 were studied. It was found that CeO 2 calcined at 550\u00b0C shows the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. It was revealed that under visible light irradiation the degradation of AO7 over CeO 2 nanoparticles follows a dye self-sensitization mechanism. The degradation rate of AO7 increases with decrease in the initial pH value of the reaction solution, and degradation efficiency decreases with increase in the initial dye concentration. The optimal dosage of CeO 2 in solution for AO7 degradation is 1g/L. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

The influences of acids (HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4) and their corresponding salts (NaCl, KNO3, and Na2SO4) on the crystalline phase and morphology of products were investigated, respectively. Compared with NaCl and KNO3 that show no evident influence on the crystalline phase, HCl and HNO3 have a decisive influence on the crystalline phase of the products. However, both H2SO4 and Na2SO4 are favorable for the formation of anatase. By adjusting the concentration of SO2-(4) in the reaction medium, the contents of anatase and rutile phases in the TiO2 powders can be successfully controlled. The morphology of TiO2 crystallites are shown to be strongly related to the type of acid used in the reaction medium.",

The photo composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), BET, Raman spectra, UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), photoluminescence spectra (PLS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD, Raman, HRTEM and XPS analysis indicated that WO x is uniformly dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 probably with monolayer thickness and the mean particle size of the composite was 12 nm. XPS analysis also indicated that the vacuum activated composites contained more W in reduced form while the calcined composites showed more W in hexavalent form. The beneficial effect of W can be explained by considering the formation of W +5 species by means of a transfer of photo-generated electrons from TiO 2 to W +6 .Subsequently W +5 could be oxidized to W +6 by transferring electrons to adsorbed O 2 .DRS showed an extension of light absorption into the visible region for this WO x composite and PL analysis indicated that the electron-hole recombination rate has been effectively inhibited when WO x is deposited on the surface of TiO 2 .The samples activated in vacuum showed higher photocatalytic activity than calcined samples in case of MO and superior activity in case of phenol. The optimal WO 3 dosage of 4.0% in WO x \u2013TiO 2 achieved the highest rate of photodegradation in this experimental condition.",

These particles are aggregated to form the peculiar morphology of microspheres at 10.0% WO 3 /TiO 2 due to the in situ formation of ammonium sulfate in supersaturated state. 5.0% composite exhibits the best photoactivity as compared to pure TiO 2 , P-25 and pure WO 3 in the degradation of methyl orange and 2, 4-dichlorophenol in UV and visible light. 10.0% WO 3 /TiO 2 composite contains more dopant contents but exhibits comparable higher activity due to its specific morphology of spheres. Morphological variations of a photocatalyst also influence the photocatalytic efficiencies. Catalysts exhibit high activity owing to the combined effects of both the unique structural characteristics and the tungsten doping. The doped tungsten (W) inhibits the electron\u2013hole recombination rate. The kinetics of the organics degradation is found to follow the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model.",

Characterization of prepared samples were done by various techniques such as, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The XRD showed the presence of only anatase TiO 2 for the single sulfur-doped and cerium- and sulfur-codoped titania samples. XRD analysis also pointed out the decrease in the crystal size with the increase in Ce concentration in the samples. The BET analysis reported an increase in the surface area and decrease in the pore size with the increase in the Ce concentration. The PLS results of the samples first showed a decrease in the intensity of the spectra sync with the reduction of recombination centers when the Ce was introduced in codoped TiO2 with the maximum decrease for 0.04 Ce/S-codoped titania; with the further increase in the Ce concentration in the samples, the intensity of the spectra gradually increased coinciding with the increase in the recombination centers. The recombination centers exhibit a direct relationship with the photocatalytic activity of the samples, which could be evidenced by the decolorization of 25 mg/L solution of AO-7. The activity of codoped samples was first increased by the incorporation of Ce with the maximum degradation for 0.04 cerium- and sulfur-codoped titania. By the further increase in the Ce amount in the Ce- and S-codoped titania samples the activity was shown to decrease gradually. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

Two different ways have been used for the synthesis of the catalysts, one through the addition of boron followed by nitrogen, and the other through the addition of nitrogen first and then by boron. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates the synergistic effect of boron and nitrogen with the formation of Ti-B-N-Ti and Ti-N-B-O compounds on the surface of catalysts when nitrogen is introduced to the materials first. When the boron is added first, only Ti-N-B-O species occurs on the surface of catalysts. The above two compounds are all thought to enhance the photocatalytic activities of codoped TiO2. Density functional theory simulations are also performed to investigate the B-N synergistic effect.

It was found that the porous structure kept unchanged during Ag was transferred into AgBr, AgBrI, AgBr@Ag, and AgBrI@Ag. Both porous AgBr@Ag and porous AgBrI@Ag showed much higher visible-light photocatalytic activity than cubic AgBr@Ag for the degradation of methyl orange, which is because the interconnected pore channels not only provide more reactive sites but also favor the transportation of photo-generated electrons and holes. For AgBrI@Ag, AgBrI solid solution formed at the interface of AgBr and AgI, and the phase junction can effectively separate the photo-generated electrons and holes, favorable to the improvement of photocatalytic activity.

        "abstract": "TiO 2 was loaded on Cr-MCM-4s8 and Cr-KIT-6 mesoporous silica matrixes (TiO 2/Cr-MCM-48 and TiO 2/Cr-KIT-6) synthesized in alkaline and acidic conditions to achieve visible-light driven photocatalytic activity. The influences of pore ordering, Cr species, and content of mesoporous matrixes to the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 were carefully studied, where the Si/Cr ratio varies from 10 to 40 both in alkaline and acidic conditions. For the acidic conditions, Cr species are present as Cr(VI) in the samples synthesized with Si/Cr > 20 and as the mixture of Cr(VI) and Cr (III) in the samples synthesized with Si/Cr \u2264 20. However, for the alkaline conditions, Cr species are present as the mixture of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in all of samples synthesized with Si/Cr = 10-40. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) indicate that the alkaline system leads to more introduction of Cr content but more deterioration of matrix ordering. UV-vis spectra and XRD patterns indicate that Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species exist as highly dispersive Cr-O-M (M = Si and Cr) in the framework and Cr 2O 3 crystal in the pore channel, respectively. For the photocatalytic application by adopting AO7 as the degradation target, all of TiO 2 loaded composites show visible-light driven photocatalytic activity, which reaches the best at Si/Cr = 30. However, almost all of the TiO 2 loaded on Cr-KIT-6 synthesized in acidic conditions show higher activities than those loaded on Cr-MCM-48 synthesized in alkaline conditions with the same Si/Cr ratio, which is attributed to the formation of less Cr 2O 3 crystal and better pore ordering of the matrix synthesized in the acidic conditions. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

Keywords Cu 2 O CeO 2 Heterojunction Photocatalyst 1 Introduction Recently, cerium oxide has been extensively studied and employed for various applications including fast ion conductors, oxygen storage capacitors and catalysts. In particular, CeO 2 has some properties like titania such as wide band gap, nontoxicity and high stability. As for pure CeO 2 , it has been investigated under UV irradiation concerning water-splitting for the generation of hydrogen gas [1] and photodegradation of toluene in the gas phase [2] . Our group has recently reported the photocatalytic behavior of CeO 2 for the degradation of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) under visible light irradiation [3] . However, CeO 2 showed low degradation rate and good adsorption ability to AO7, which is attributed to the low light absorption efficiency of CeO 2 . Many strategies are commonly used to extend the spectral photoresponse of wide band gap semiconductors like titania to visible light region such as doping with transition metals [4] , dye sensitization [5] and anionic doping [6] . Besides, another promising idea is to couple them with narrow band gap semiconductors. In this configuration, several advantages can be obtained: (1) an improvement of charge separation; (2) an increase in the lifetime of the charge carrier and (3) an enhancement of the interfacial charge transfer efficiency to adsorbed substrate [7] . Cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) is a p-type semiconductor having a direct band gap of 2.0 eV, which has been previously studied for application in solar energy converting devices [8] . As reported by Li et al. [9] , the Ce 4f band potential of CeO 2 is similar to TiO 2 , which is lower than that of Cu 2 O, and the electron can be theoretically injected from Cu 2 O to the conduction band of CeO 2 . Therefore, we proposed that Cu 2 O is suitable for CeO 2 as sensitizer due to the energy band match. In this study, nanocrystal Cu 2 O loaded CeO 2 was fabricated via a soak-reduction method to form a novel Cu 2 O/CeO 2 heterojunction composite as a visible light-driven photocatalyst. This new coupled system, to our knowledge, was reported for the first time. Compared with pure CeO 2 sample, the coupled photocatalyst presented better visible light absorption capacity and photocatalytic activity to AO7. 2 Experimentals 2.1 Preparation of Catalysts Cu 2 O/CeO 2 heterojunction photocatalysts were prepared by a soak-reduction method using glucose as the reducing agent. Typically, a certain amount CuCl 2 was dissolved in 50 mL distilled water to form different concentration solutions, which is 0.01, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 M, respectively. Then 0.6 g CeO 2 prepared by direct calcination of cerium nitrate at 723 K for 6 h was dispersed in above solutions and treated with ulrasound to obtain uniform a suspension. The suspension was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 1 h to reach the adsorption equilibrium. After stirring, the mixtures were centrifuged and washed by deionized water for several times to dispose of free Cu 2+ ions in solutions. The mixture was added into 40 mL 1 M glucose solution to form a suspension and then heated to 60 \u00b0C in water bath under stirring. Then 20 mL 2 M NaOH was slowly added into the suspension until the color turned from green to pale yellow. After 15 min stirring, the products were collected by filtration, washed with deionized water for several times and dried under vacuum for 4 h at 60 \u00b0C. 2.2 Characterizations of Photocatalysts The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS), UV-visible absorption spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Details are given in the Supplementary Material. 2.3 Photocatalytic Activity Test The visible light photocatalytic activity test is similar to our previous report [3] and has been detailed in the supporting information. In this test, an aqueous suspension of AO7 (60 mL, 35 mg/L) and 0.06 g photocatalyst powder were applied. The change on the concentration of AO7 after irradiation was analyzed by UV-vis absorption spectra. The starting point of the concentration\u2013time plot was collected after the suspension was stirred for 1 h in darkness to reach the adsorption equilibrium. C 0 and C t referred to the equilibrated and the original dye concentrations. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Characterization of the Cu 2 O/CeO 2 Composites Fig.\u00a01 displays XRD patterns of Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composite photocatalysts prepared with different concentrations of CuCl 2 . From Fig.\u00a01 , however, we can find all the diffraction peaks only match the standard data for CeO 2 and no additional phases such as Cu 2 O, CuO or Cu can be detected in all the samples. Since only very small amount of Cu 2+ can be adsorbed on CeO 2 after centrifuged from CuCl 2 solution, which may be attributed to the relative low surface area of CeO 2 particle prepared by direct calcination with Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , the absence of detection can be explained as that cuprous oxide particles are so tiny (less than 3 nm) and beyond the detection limit of XRD [10,11] . To illustrate that the soak-reduction method can actually form Cu 2 O crystal, we prepared sample without the disposing of free Cu 2+ in the solution. As seen from the XRD pattern shown in Fig. S1, the diffraction peak attributed to Cu 2 O can be obviously observed. However, this composite show much more severe dark adsorption than pure CeO 2 , which has negligible photocatalytic activity. As the cuprous oxide cannot be detected by XRD, EDS were employed to confirm the presence and content of cuprous oxide in the Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composites. Table\u00a01 shows the EDS data of Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composites prepared with different concentrations of CuCl 2 . Only the elements of O, Ce and Cu can be observed and the molar ratios of Cu 2 O to CeO 2 in the composites prepared with different concentrations of CuCl 2 (0.01, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 M) are calculated to be 0.012, 0.016, 0.029 and 0.032, which increases with the concentration of CuCl 2 . The result also reveals the content of cuprous oxide dispersed on CeO 2 particle is so small that it is hard to highly crystallize at the reduction stage. It can be inferred that Cu 2 O probably forms nanocluster and attaches to the CeO 2 surface. XPS was employed to confirm that Cu species on the surface of CeO 2 particle exist as + 1 valence state. Fig.\u00a02 (A) shows the survey spectra of the sample prepared in 0.06 M CuCl 2 solution. As shown in the survey spectra, element Cu, O, Ce, and C co-exist in the sample, where the carbon peaks are attributed to the residual carbon from the sample and adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument itself. This result is in good agreement with the EDS data. Fig.\u00a02 (B) shows the pattern of the X-ray photoelectron scan for the Cu 2p 3/2 of composite photocatalyst prepared in 0.06 M CuCl 2 solution. The only peak located at 931.8 eV can be attributed to Cu (I) in Cu 2 O, although it is lower than the reported binding energy of Cu 2 O at 932.4 eV. The similar result was also observed in Huang's experiment and the shift can be explained as the small content of Cu 2 O on the surface of CeO 2 particles [12] and the different chemical environment around Cu 2 O compared to bulk Cu 2 O. It is known Cu 2 O can be easily oxidized to CuO during the washing and drying treatment process. However, from the XPS data, there is no peak attributed to Cu (II), where the range of binding energy is from 933.4 to 933.9 eV. It is probably because that nanocrystal Cu 2 O is more stable than bulk Cu 2 O under ambient atmosphere because Cu 2 O has a high-symmetry (cubic) structure and a lower anion/cation ratio, which is more stable at small particle size [12] . 3.2 Photocatalytic Activity Fig.\u00a03 shows the photocatalytic degradation curves of AO7 using CeO 2 and Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composites prepared with different CuCl 2 concentrations as photocatalyst. From the curves, it is found that under visible light irradiation, all the composites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of AO7 than pure CeO 2 . It can also be found that the photocatalytic activity of Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composites increases with the increasing amount of CuCl 2 and reaches to the best for the sample prepared in 0.06 M CuCl 2 solution. About 96.2% of AO7 is degraded after 4 h irradiation, while only 77.6% of AO7 can be decomposed using pure CeO 2 as photocatalyst. The degradation percentage is not further increased when the concentration of CuCl 2 solution increases from 0.06 to 0.08 M. That is to say, the amount of Cu 2 O in the composites plays an important role in the photocatalytic performance. The GC-MAS was also applied to identify the intermediates during the photodegradation of AO7 for the sample prepared in 0.06 M CuCl 2 solution. The main products included substituted benzene, such as benzoic acid, phenol, phthalic anhydride and low molecular weight organic 4-oxo-2-butenoic acid, which suggests that AO7 is almost completely photodegradated by Cu 2 O/CeO 2 . Because adsorption also plays an important role in most photocatalytic reactions, the adsorption capacity of all catalysts during the whole decolorization process was investigated ( Fig.\u00a04 ). As we studied before [3] , CeO 2 has the superior adsorption capacity to AO7 and from this pattern, we can also see that in the whole decolorization process of pure CeO 2 , almost 60% of AO7 molecules adsorbs on CeO 2 surface on the dark adsorption stage and only 30% of AO7 are decomposed by photocatalysis ( Fig.\u00a04 a). Hereby, the high decolorization efficiency of pure CeO 2 can be mainly attributed to its high adsorption capability to AO7 molecules. After loaded with Cu 2 O, however, the dark adsorption capacity becomes much lower even with the least loading amount of Cu 2 O ( Fig.\u00a04 b), which may be attributed to the reduced specific surface area as seen from Table\u00a01 . Actually, the photocatalytic activity usually improves with adsorption capacity during the photocatalysis process. But it is observed in Fig.\u00a04 d that sample prepared in 0.06 M CuCl 2 solution with best photocatalytic activity only adsorbs about 30% of AO7 during dark adsorption process. From these data, it is apparent that the high decolorization percentage of Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composite is not mainly attributed to the adsorption capability any more. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of pure CeO 2 and Cu 2 O loaded CeO 2 (prepared in 0.06 M CuCl 2 solution) are shown in Fig.\u00a05 . It shows that the Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composite has a red shift and increased absorption in the visible range. The optical band gap energy ( E g ) was calculated based on the absorbance spectrum of the powders according to equation of E g = 1240/ \u03bb Absorp.Edge . Pure CeO 2 and Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composite show the band gap absorption onset at 425 and 437 nm, which correspond to band gap energies of 2.92 and 2.84 eV, respectively. Consequently, the optical absorption edge of the Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composite shifts to the lower energy region compared to the pure CeO 2 , and its absorption is stronger in the wavelength range of 400\u2013600 nm. That is to say, Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composite photocatalyst has high optical absorption capability than pure CeO 2 and more photo-introduced electrons/holes pairs can be generated under visible light irradiation. 3.3 Mechanism According to the DRS data, one of the factors for enhanced activity of Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composite can be probably attributed to the improved optical absorption. Furthermore, following the model described by Chen et al. [13] , n-type CeO 2 and p-type Cu 2 O semiconductors can form p\u2013n junction photocatalysts when Cu 2 O is loaded on CeO 2 surface, which is favorable for the separation of photo-generated charges. As shown in Scheme\u00a01 , the generated electrons in Cu 2 O and holes in CeO 2 immigrate to the conduction band of CeO 2 and the valence band of Cu 2 O, respectively. At the equilibrium, the inner electric field forms, where p-Cu 2 O region has the negative charge while n-CeO 2 region has the positive charge. Under visible light irradiation, electron\u2013hole pairs may be generated. With the effect of the inner electric field, the holes flow into the negative field while the electrons move to the positive field. Hereby, the photo-generated electron\u2013hole pairs will be separated more effectively in the Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composite. Moreover, the Cu 2 O nanocrystal dispersed on CeO 2 surface broadens the band gap of Cu 2 O due to the quantum size effect. Consequently, the oxidative power of photo-generated holes on valence band should be stronger than those in bulk Cu 2 O, which may accelerate the degradation process. Moreover, to exclude the effect of C sensitization on the photocatalytic activity, we studied the photodegradation for AO7 using sample prepared without the addition of CuCl 2 . The result shown in Fig. S3 indicate CeO 2 treated only with glucose and NaOH shows reduced activity toward AO7, which well excludes the C sensitization effect. 4 Conclusions Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composite was prepared by reduction of Cu 2+ adsorbed on CeO 2 surface using glucose as the reductant. The adsorption capability of Cu 2 O/CeO 2 composites to AO7 was much lower than pure CeO 2 , but the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of AO7 under visible light irradiation was significantly enhanced. The enhancement of photocatalytic degradation could be explained by the improved visible light absorption and the formation of p\u2013n junction.

        "abstract": "Fe 3+ doped TiO 2 deposited with Au (Au/Fe\u2013TiO 2 ) was successfully prepared with an attempt to extend light absorption of TiO 2 into the visible region and reduce the rapid recombination of electrons and holes. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 physical adsorption, Raman spectroscopy, atomic absorption flame emission spectroscopy (AAS), UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated for the degradation of 2,4-chlorophenol in aqueous solutions under visible light ( \u03bb > 420 nm) and UV light irradiation. The results of XRD, XPS and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis indicated that Fe 3+ substituted for Ti 4+ in the lattice of TiO 2 , Au existed as Au 0 on the surface of the photocatalyst and the mean particle size of Au was 8 nm. Diffuse reflectance measurements showed an extension of light absorption into the visible region for Au/Fe\u2013TiO 2 , and PL analysis indicated that the electron\u2013hole recombination rate has been effectively inhibited when Au deposited on the surface of Fe-doped TiO 2 . Compared with Fe doped TiO 2 sample and Au deposited TiO 2 sample, the Au/Fe\u2013TiO 2 photocatalyst exhibited excellent visible light and UV light activity and the synergistic effects of Fe 3+ and Au was responsible for improving the photocatalytic activity. Keywords Titania Fe 3+ doped Au deposited Photodegradation Synergistic effect 1 Introduction Nanosized TiO 2 as one of the most promising photocatalysts has long been investigated for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, photocatalytic dissociation of water, solar energy conversion and disinfection [1\u20135] . However, because of its large band gap of 3.2 eV, TiO 2 can only be excited by a small UV fraction of solar light, which has practically ruled out the use of sunlight as an energy source. Secondly, the high rate of electron\u2013hole recombination often results in a low quantum yield and poor efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. These fundamental problems prevent TiO 2 from practical application. In recent years, great efforts have been made to develop TiO 2 -based photocatalysts sensitive to visible light in order to make use of solar energy more efficiently in practical applications [6\u201310] . Metal-doped TiO 2 has been widely studied for improving photocatalytic performance on the degradation of various organic pollutants under visible light irradiation [11\u201318] . Choi et al. conducted a systematic study on the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 nanoparticles doped with 21 transition metal elements and found that doping with Fe 3+ , Mo 5+ , Ru 3+ , Os 3+ , Re 5+ , V 4+ , Rh 3+ significantly increased photoactivity in the liquid-phase photodegradation of CHCl 3 , while Co 3+ and Al 3+ doping decreased the photoactivity [7] . Nagaveni et al. developed W, V, Ce, Zr, Fe and Cu ion-doped anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles by a solution combustion method and found that the solid formation was limited to a narrow range of concentrations of the dopants ions [16] . Kisch et al. reported Pt 4+ doped TiO 2 exhibited higher visible photoactivity on the degradation of 4-chlorophenol [18] . Among these transition metal elements, Fe 3+ was considered as an interesting dopant of TiO 2 and most of the investigations have been carried out by preparation of Fe-doped TiO 2 using chemical and physical methods [19\u201328] . It was believed that Fe doping procedure directly influences the intrinsic properties of TiO 2 , such as charge carried recombination rates, the particle size and interfacial electron-transfer rates and extending photoresponse of TiO 2 into the visible range [19,21,22,27\u201328] . However, it was also reported that Fe 3+ cations doping introduced an impurity level into the band gap was detrimental to the photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation due to recombination of the generated hole and electron on the impurity level [6,7,21] . Many studies have been carried out to improve the photocatalytic activity by reducing the recombination reaction by the deposition of noble metals such as Au, Ag, Pt, Pd on the surface of TiO 2 and it was confirmed that the deposition of noble metal on TiO 2 nanoparticles was an essential factor for maximizing the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions [29\u201335] . The noble metal which acts as a sink for photo-induced charge carriers, promotes interfacial charge-transfer processes. Additionally, recent investigations on gold titania nanocomposite particles also show that the presence of nanosized gold particles supported on TiO 2 extended the response of the photocatalyst into visible light region by the surface plasmon absorption of the gold [36,37] . It is now well established that the catalytic properties of Au depends on the support, the preparation method and particularly the shape and size of the Au clusters [38\u201344] . However, these studies were primarily concerned with Au deposition on the undoped TiO 2 or P25 titania for photocatalytic application. There have been few research focusing on Au deposition on the surface of modified TiO 2 [45\u201347] . Therefore, enlightened by the respective advantages of transition metal doping and deposition of noble metal, we deposited Au nanoparticles on the modified TiO 2 (Fe doped TiO 2 ) aiming to develop a novel photocatalyst with good performance under both visible light and UV light irradiation. Moreover, to study of gold deposited over modified TiO 2 for photocatalytic application is also an interesting topic. We previously reported Fe-doped TiO 2 prepared by the combination of sol\u2013gel process with hydrothermal treatment and this Fe-doped TiO 2 photocatalyst exhibited visible activity during the degradation of methyl orange. The effect of Fe 3+ dopant has been studied in our group [27] . Zanella et al. reported a promising way to prepare Au/TiO 2 by deposition\u2013precipitation with urea for CO oxidation, by which can reach a high Au loading and small Au particle size [48] . Herein, we have developed a novel TiO 2 photocatalyst by Fe 3+ doping together with Au deposition (using deposition\u2013precipitation with urea) and its photocatalytic activity has been tested for degradation of organic compound under both UV light and visible light irradiation. As expected, the Au/Fe\u2013TiO 2 photocatalyst with excellent visible light and UV light activity has been demonstrated and Fe 3+ and Au had synergistic effects on improving the photocatalytic activity under both visible and UV light irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, such researches concerning this field have never been reported. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The preparation procedure of Fe 3+ doped TiO 2 deposited with Au consists of two steps. Firstly, the Fe 3+ doped TiO 2 was prepared by combining sol-gel method with hydrothermal treatment. 6 mL tetrabutyl titanate was dissolved into 34 mL anhydrous ethanol (solution A), solution B consisted of 17 mL anhydrous ethanol, 0.4 mL nitric acid, 1.6 mL distilled water and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 in the required stoichiometry (Fe/Ti = 0.57%, molar ratio). Then solution A was added drop-wise to solution B under stirring magnetically. The resultant mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h to hydrolysis until the transparent sol was obtained. The sol was then aged for 2 days until the formation of gel, which was then transferred into a 100-mL Teflon-inner-liner stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was kept for 10 h under 453 K for crystallization. After this hydrothermal treatment, the precipitate was washed, dried and ground to obtain Fe 3+ doped TiO 2 nanoparticles. Undoped TiO 2 was also prepared by the same way without adding Fe(NO 3 ) 3 . Secondly, One gram of Fe\u2013TiO 2 was added to 100 mL of amount aqueous solution containing HAuCl 4 (2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22122 M) and urea (0.42 M). The suspension thermostated at 353 K was vigorously stirred for 4 h. Decomposition of urea leads to a gradual rise in pH. These sequences of preparation in solution were performed in the dark, since light is known to decompose the gold precursors and to reduce them. The solids gathered after centrifugation were washed with deionized water four times, and then dried under vacuum at 373 K for 2 h in the dark, calcined at 673 K under a flow of industrial air (100 ml min \u22121 ) with a heating rate of 2 K min \u22121 and then maintained 4 h. Au weight loading of the sample is expressed in grams of Au per grams of sample: wt%Au = [m Au /(m Au + m Fe\u2013TiO2 )] \u00d7 100. The nominal content of Au in the samples was 0.0, 2.0, 3.0 wt%, designated as 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 , 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 , 3.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 , respectively. Undoped TiO 2 deposited with 2.0, 3.0 wt% Au are designated as 2.0Au/TiO 2 , 3.0Au/TiO 2 , respectively. All chemicals are of analytical grade and used without further purification. 2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the prepared photocatalysts was carried out at room temperature with a Rigaku D/max 2550 VB/PC apparatus using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) and a graphite monochromator, operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. Diffraction patterns were recorded in the angular range of 10\u00b0\u201380\u00b0 with a stepwidth of 0.02\u00b0 s \u22121 . The surface morphologies and particle sizes were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2011), using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The S BET of the samples were determined through nitrogen physical adsorption at 77 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2010). All the samples were degassed at 473 K before the measurement. The actual content of Au deposited on TiO 2 and 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 was determined by atomic absorption flame emission spectroscopy (Shimadzu AA-6400F). Raman measurements were performed at room temperature using a Via+ Reflex Raman spectrometer with the excitation light of 514 nm. To analyze the light absorption of the photocatalysts, UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a scan UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 500) equipped with an integrating sphere assembly, while BaSO 4 was used as a reference. To investigate the chemical states of the photocatalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded with PerkinElmer PHI 5000C ESCA Systerm with Al K\u03b1 radiation operated at 250 W. The shift of binding energy due to relative surface charging was corrected using the C 1s level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. The recombination of electron\u2013hole in the samples was studied by the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra, which was measured on a luminescence spectrometry (Cary Eclips) at room temperature under the excitation light at 280 nm. The conditions are fixed as far as possible in order to compare the photoluminescence intensity directly. 2.3 Photocatalytic activity test The photocatalytic activity of each sample was evaluated in terms of the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) was chosen as a model pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic activities. The photocatalyst (0.08 g) was added into an 100-mL quartz photoreactor containing 80 mL of a 50-mg L \u22121 2,4-DCP solution. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred for 30 min in the dark in order to reach the adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. A 1000-W tungsten halogen lamp equipped with a UV cut-off filters ( \u03bb > 420 nm) was used as a visible light source (the average light intensity was 60 mW cm \u22122 ) and a 300-W high-pressure Hg lamp for which the strongest emission wavelength is 365 nm was used as a UV light source (the average light intensity was about 1230 \u03bcW cm 2 ). The lamp was cooled with flowing water in a quartz cylindrical jacket around the lamp, and ambient temperature is maintained during the photocatalytic reaction. At the given time intervals, the analytical samples were taken from the mixture and immediately centrifuged, then filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm Millipore filter to remove the photocatalysts. The concentration of the filtrate was analyzed by checking the absorbance at 284 nm with a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 100). The reproducibility was checked by repeating the measurements at least three times and was found to be within the acceptable limit (\u00b15%). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of all samples are ascribed to the peaks of TiO 2 anatase phase [JCPDS no.21-1272, spacegroup: I4 1 /amd (1 4 1)]. No significant characteristic peak of iron oxide can be found in Fe-doped TiO 2 , due to lower amount of iron. Furthermore, no distinct peaks corresponding to Au phase was observed in the case of the samples containing Au, indicating of smaller crystallite size of Au or Au particles well dispersed on the surface of TiO 2 and Fe-doped TiO 2 . The average crystallizes size of all the samples are estimated using the Scherrer equation: D = K \u03bb \u03b2 \u2009 cos \u2009 \u03b8 where \u03b2 is the half-height width of the diffraction peak of anatase, K = 0.89 is a coefficient, \u03b8 is the diffraction angle, and \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength corresponding to the Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The crystallite size of all samples calculated for anatase (1 0 1) peak is shown in Table 1 . As can be seen from Table 1 , the crystallite sizes of Fe-doped TiO 2 is slightly lower than that of non-doped TiO 2 , indicating the occurrence of a slight lattice distortion in the anatase structure. The dimension decrease is caused by a number of defects in the anatase crystallites produced by the substitution of part of the Ti 4+ site by Fe 3+ ions, which may hinder crystallite growth [26] . Additionally, with respect to the Au/TiO 2 samples and Au/0.57 Fe\u2013TiO 2 samples, no obvious changes on their crystallite size is observed after Au deposited on the non-doped TiO 2 or Fe-doped TiO 2 . Therefore, it can be concluded that Au deposited on the surface of TiO 2 lead to less impact on the crystalline phase, crystalline size, and crystallinity of TiO 2 . 3.1.2 BET-specific surface areas As is shown from Table 1 , all samples have large surface areas, which may contribute to the high photocatalytic activities of the samples. All of samples have similar value of the particle sizes and specific surface areas, such similarities in physicochemical properties make it convenient to study the effects of Fe 3+ and Au on the performance of these photocatalysts. 3.1.3 Atomic absorption flame emission spectroscopy (AAS) studies The actual content of Au in different samples is determined by AAS, the results are also listed in Table 1 . It is shown that the actual content of Au measured by AAS is close to the theoretical value, indicating that most of Au in solution is deposited on the surface of TiO 2 or Fe\u2013TiO 2 by deposition\u2013precipitation with urea. This result is consistent with the literature reported [48] . 3.1.4 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) TEM images of 3.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 and 3.0Au/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 2 . The micrographs of these catalysts (b and d) show that the gold particles are highly dispersed on the surface of non-doped TiO 2 and Fe doped TiO 2 , and the mean diameter of gold particles estimated from the TEM images are 9 nm for the non-doped TiO 2 samples and 8 nm for the Fe-doped TiO 2 samples. Compared with 3.0Au/TiO 2 , the lower Au particle size of 3.0Au/Fe\u2013TiO 2 may result by the presence of defects between the anatase crystallite produced by the substitution of part of the Ti 4+ site by Fe 3+ ions, which could work as particle pinning centers of the gold particles for hindering their diffusion as well as preventing the formation of larger gold particles. This result is in good agreement with literature proposals [49] . It also can be shown that the matrix TiO 2 and Fe-doped TiO 2 have the mean particle size of 10 nm and 9 nm, respectively, which is in consistent with the result of XRD. Fig. 2 a and c showed that gold particles are highly crystallized and well dispersed. 3.1.5 Raman studies Raman spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 3 . The Raman spectra of all the samples are characterized by a strong band at 144 cm \u22121 , three middle intensity bands at 394 cm \u22121 , 514 cm \u22121 , 638 cm \u22121 , and a weak band at 197 cm \u22121 . These peaks can be assigned to the fundamental vibration modes of anatase TiO 2 with the symmetries of E g , B 1g , A 1g , E g and E g [50,51] , respectively, and these results are consistent with the XRD measurements. No Raman lines due to iron oxide can be observed in the Fe 3+ doped samples, confirming Fe 3+ may present in the substitutional positions in the lattice of TiO 2 . 3.1.6 UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra The UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra of samples are presented in Fig. 4 . The spectrum of 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 shows a significant enhancement of light absorption at a wavelength of 400\u2013600 nm compared with non-doped TiO 2 . The origin of this visible light absorption is due to the formation of a dopant energy level within the band gap of TiO 2 . The excitation of 3d electrons of Fe 3+ transferring from the dopant energy level to the conduction band of TiO 2 could effectively shift the band edge absorption threshold to visible light region [6] . 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 and 2.0Au/TiO 2 show a strong absorption peak at 500\u2013600 nm due to the plasmon resonance of Au, which arises from the collective oscillations of the free conduction band electrons that are induced by the incident electromagnetic radiation [34,52] . The absorption of 2.0Au/TiO 2 and 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 centered at 537 nm, 563 nm, respectively. That indicates that the surface of plasmon band of 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 shifts toward longer wavelength. According to the literature proposal [34] , for Au/TiO 2 samples, the surface plasmon resonance of metallic nanoparticles is sensitive to the particle size, shape, load and surrounding environment. So the shift of plasmon band of 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 would be attributed to its different surrounding environment of Au particles from that of 2.0Au/TiO 2 and there may existence of interactions between Au particles and Fe\u2013TiO 2 . 3.1.7 XPS spectra The XPS spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 5 . With respect to the XPS peaks of Ti 2p, although there are slight differences in the locations of binding energies of Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 among different samples, they are all still in good agreement with the values of Ti 4+ . No broad FWHM (full width half maximum) of Ti 2p 3/2 signals also indicate the only presence of Ti 4+ species [53] . The O 1s binding energies of all the samples are located at a little higher value than 530.0 eV, which is assigned to bulk oxide (O 2\u2212 ) in the TiO 2 lattice. Therefore, it can be concluded that no obvious changes on the chemical state of Ti and O can be caused by doped Fe 3+ and deposited Au. The Au 4f 7/2 and Au 4f 5/2 binding energies at 83.5 eV, 87.1 eV for 2.0Au/TiO 2 and at 83.0 eV, 86.6 eV for the 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 are identical to the values of fully reduced Au reported by other groups, which suggesting Au species exist in their metallic state [54,55] . Zanella et al. [56] reported oxidation gold can be completely reduced in metallic gold when the Au/TiO 2 catalyst prepared by deposition\u2013precipitation with urea was calcinated at temperature above 473 K under air flow. Although the signals indicate that Au exists as Au 0 in 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 and 2.0Au/TiO 2 , the Au 4f binding energies of the former are negative shift (0.5 eV), indicating some charges may be transferred to Au species on the surface of TiO 2 . The Fe 2p XPS spectra show extremely low contents of Fe on the surface of 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 and 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 . Binding energy of Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe2p 1/2 at 710.7 eV, 722.7 eV for 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 sample and at 711.2 eV, 723.2 eV for 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 sample suggest that Fe species are present in the oxide state [27] . Compared with 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 , the positive shift of Fe 2p (0.5 eV) for 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 indicates charges of Fe may transfer to Au species. It can be concluded that there may exist strong interactions between Au and Fe\u2013TiO 2 , which may change the electronic property of Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 . This result is in consistent with conclusion by the shift of plasmon band of 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 . 3.1.8 PL measurement Photoluminescence (PL) emission is useful to disclose the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, and to understand the fate electron\u2013hole pairs in semiconductor particles [19] . In this study, the PL emission spectra of several samples were examined in the wavelength range of 320\u2013500 nm, as shown in Fig. 6 . It can be observed that the positions of the peaks around 380 nm which is assign to emission of the band gap transition [57,58] are similar while PL intensities are different among these samples. The PL intensity of 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 is the highest among all samples, indicating the recombination of electron and hole has been promoted in 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 . It may be explained as that Fe 3+ act as recombination center for the photogenerated charge carriers. 2.0Au/TiO 2 and 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 exhibit a significantly declined PL intensity compared with TiO 2 , demonstrating electron\u2013hole recombination has been suppressed in these two samples [37] . This may due to the presence of Au on the surface of TiO 2 favor the migration of photo-produced electron to gold, thus improving the electron\u2013hole separation. Although Fe 3+ favors electron\u2013hole recombination in 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 , this effect can be greatly weakened by Au deposited on 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 because photo-produced electrons are rapidly trapped by Au and the remaining holes are trapped by Fe 3+ , the recombination rate of electron\u2013hole pair decreases, so the intensity is the lowest in 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 . The decrease of PL intensity can benefit enhancement of photocatalytic activity of the samples [59,60] . 3.2 Photocatalytic activity We have reported TiO 2 photocatalysts by Fe 3+ doping together with Au deposition for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under UV light and visible light and found that the optimum Au dosage is 3.0 wt% under UV light irradiation and 2.0 wt% under visible light irradiation [61] . However, some researchers thought the dye, not TiO 2 was excited by visible light in the presence of TiO 2 and injected an electron into the conduction band of TiO 2 , from where it was scavenged by preadsorbed oxygen to form active radicals [62] . That is to say that the sensitization of dye leads to the photoreactivity of TiO 2 in the visible light region. In order to eliminate the sensitization of dye, 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) solutions owing to its colorless and no absorption in the visible region were selected to be the target pollutants which are degraded under UV light and visible light illumination. Fig. 7 shows that the degradation rate of 2,4-DCP under visible light in the presence of TiO 2 , 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 , 2.0Au/TiO 2 and 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 . Under visible light, undoped TiO 2 exhibits almost no activity, 10% loss of 2,4-DCP may result by polymerization of 2,4-DCP [63] . Fe doped TiO 2 sample shows good photocatalytic activity. Since Fe 3+ ions can enhance the intensity of absorption in the visible light region and make a red shift in the band gap transition of the Fe-doped TiO 2 samples. This can induce more photo-generated electrons and holes to participate in the photocatalytic reactions. Apart from this effect, Fe 3+ ions can also serve as a mediator of the transfer of interfacial charge at an appropriate doping concentration [27] . In addition, 2.0Au/TiO 2 also has better performance than undoped TiO 2 , because Au particles deposition can not only extend the response to visible light region due to the plasmon resonance of Au, but also capture electrons, resulting in the inhibition of electron\u2013hole recombination. Clearly, 2.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 2,4-DCP, besides including advantages of Fe doping and Au deposition, this also may be owing to the synergistic effects of doped Fe 3+ and deposited Au on the enhancement of visible light activity. That can be explained as follow: Fe 3+ presents in the substitution positions in the TiO 2 lattice would introduce a dopant energy level into the band gap of TiO 2 as well as the plasmon resonance of Au particles result in absorption into the visible region [19,34] . Under visible light illumination, the electrons can be excited from the dopant level to the conduction band [7,19] , then they are transferred to Au 0 deposited on the surface of TiO 2 , which can enhance the electron\u2013hole separation and the subsequent transfer of the trapped electrons to the adsorbed O 2 molecules [54] . Thus the photocatalytic activity can be efficiently improved. The photodegradation of 2,4-DCP under UV light in the presence of TiO 2 , 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 , 3.0Au/TiO 2 , 3.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 and P25 is shown in Fig. 8 . It is shown that under UV light illumination, the photocatalytic activity of 0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 decreased compared with undoped TiO 2 , which is in agreement with other groups [29] . It can be attributable to the detrimental effect of Fe 3+ in increasing electron\u2013hole recombination which has been confirmed by PL measurement. A lot of electrons from the valence band are excited to the conduct band under UV irradiation owing to UV light with higher energy. However, these generated electrons would be trapped by Fe 3+ in the lattice TiO 2 rather than be transferred to the surface of TiO 2 . Meanwhile, many generated holes could also be scavenged by Fe 3+ , thus Fe 3+ become the recombination center and result in the decrease of UV light photoactivity of Fe doped TiO 2 [29] . Additionally, 3.0Au/TiO 2 is more photoactive than TiO 2 because of the same positive role played by Au as under visible light illumination. Compared to the other three samples, 3.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 exhibits higher photocatalytic activity, even close to P25, a well-known commercial photocatalyst with high UV photoactivity. The higher photoactivity of 3.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 may be attributed to the following reasons. The synergistic effects of doped Fe 3+ and deposited Au are responsible for enhancement photocatalytic performance. Under UV light illumination, the excited electrons can be trapped by Au; meanwhile the remaining holes are trapped by Fe 3+ and then transferred to the surface to initiate the photocatalytic processes. The mechanism of degradation of 2,4-DCP under UV light illumination is different from that of under visible light. It was reported that Au/TiO 2 photocatalysts with small Au particle size and 0.5\u20132% loading were more active. Orlov et al. and Tian et al. reported Au/P25 catalyst with Au particle size of 3 nm and 1% Au loading exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl tert -butyl ether (MTBE) and methyl orange [40,42] . Gonz\u00e1lez et al. found Au/Al 2 O 3 \u2013TiO 2 photocatalyst with Au particle size of 7 nm and 0.55% Au loading had better activity for degradation of MTBE [39] . However, the 3.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 with Au particle size of 8 nm showed higher activity for degradation of 2,4-DCP. It seems that our result is inconsistent with other groups. We propose that the photocatalytic performance of Au/TiO 2 is dependent on not only Au particle size but also the properties of TiO 2 . Our previous study revealed that the Au particles with an appropriate size can possess an energy level between the conduct band of TiO 2 and the adsorbed O 2 . Thus, the photoelectrons can be captured by gold particles and subsequently be transferred to the adsorbed O 2 , leading to the effective separation of electrons and holes, and consequently increasing the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 . While too large or too small gold particles size is disadvantage of transferring photoelectrons [42] . With regards to photocatalytic reaction, it should be note that both chemical and physical properties of TiO 2 such as particle size, phase composition, surface area and concentration of lattice defects and impurities can have great influence on its performance [64] . It is also suggested that particle size of TiO 2 is a crucial factor in the dynamics of the electron/hole recombination process, in large TiO 2 nanoparticles, bulk recombination of the charge carriers was the dominant process, which could be reduced by a decrease in particle size; as the particle size become very small, surface recombination process became dominant [65] . In the 3.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 sample, the particle size of Fe-doped TiO 2 is about 9 nm, which is quite different from P25 with particle size of 30 nm. Under UV light irradiation, with respect to the 3.0Au/Fe-doped TiO 2 sample, most of the electrons and holes were generated close to the surface and surface recombination was dominant process. When Au deposited on the surface of Fe-doped TiO 2 , the excited electrons close to the surface were transferred from TiO 2 to Au nanoparticles, improving the charge separation and hence inhibition of surface recombination process [66] . Thus, the effect of Au particle size on photocatalytic performance is relative to the properties of TiO 2 . In most studies, the deposition of a noble metal on semiconductor nanoparticles is in general beneficial for maximizing the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. However, it is suspected that the deactivation of catalyst surface in Au doped TiO 2 may be faster than undoped TiO 2 . Because the generated\u2013hole at the TiO 2 surface and hydroxyl radicals during the photocatalytic reaction may oxidize Au into Au ion [67] . This will adversely affect on the life of the photocatalyst so the increase in activity of the TiO 2 will be for short span and the catalyst cannot be used for long term. In our case, no noticeable differences were observed in the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra and TEM image of the 3.0Au/0.57Fe\u2013TiO 2 photocatalysts before and after the photocatalytic reaction (not shown). This excludes the possibility of further oxidation of Au intercalation of Au + into TiO 2 and aggregation of Au particle during photocatalysis. Arabatzis et al. [68] and Sonawane et al. [39] have reported that no appreciable deactivation of Au/TiO 2 film was observed when Au/TiO 2 film was applied for degradation of MO under UV light and decomposition of phenol in sunlight. It is known that the oxide-containing radicals, especially hydroxyl radical, act as the active agents for the decomposition of the organic compounds. The researches on mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of MO show that hydroxyl radicals prefer to attack the electron-rich sites of MO and result the formation intermediate organic species and subsequently complete oxidation of these species to water and carbon dioxide [69] . Therefore, we assume that hydroxyl radical seems to take precedence over the oxidation of organic compounds rather than Au species loaded on TiO 2 surface. 4 Conclusions Fe 3+ doped TiO 2 deposited with Au (Au/Fe\u2013TiO 2 ) has been synthesized. Results of various characterization methods indicate Fe 3+ presents in the substitutional position in the lattice of TiO 2 , and Au exists as Au 0 on the surface of the samples. Photocatalytic experiments show that Fe 3+ and Au have synergistically improved the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 under both visible light and UV light illumination. Explanation for the synergistic effects of Fe 3+ and Au under visible light and UV light illumination has been discussed. Under visible light illumination, Fe 3+ plays a role in extending light absorption into the visible region, and Au acts as traps for visible light-induced electrons, resulting in reduction of recombination. Under UV light illumination, the excited electrons can be trapped by Au; meanwhile the remaining holes are trapped by Fe 3+ and then transferred to the surface to initiate the photocatalytic processes.

        "abstract": "The electrospinning of sulfonated poly(phthalazinone ether sulfone ketone) (SPPESK) and its blend with polyether sulfone (PES) were investigated and the blend nanofibers were applied as a catalyst in esterification. Attempts to electrospin pure SPPESK resulted in electrospraying rather than electrospinning. However, a blend polymer solution of SPPESK and PES resulted in smooth electrospinning when SPPESK content was lower than 9 wt%. The geometrical properties such as fiber diameter and distribution, surface chemical properties such as inter-molecular interaction and crystalline, mechanical properties were investigated by SEM, FTIR, XRD, etc. The catalytic activities of SPPESK-PES nanofibers were measured by esterification of ethanol with acetic acid. A pseudo-homogeneous model was established to describe the kinetics of esterification with nanofiber as a catalyst. The results showed that the SPPESK-PES blend nanofiber had a high specific surface area (46.7-58.9 m 2/g), good mechanical properties, good catalytic properties (ethanol conversion up to 80 % when reacted 8 h), and good forward rate constants (10.0 \u00d7 10-3-14.6 \u00d7 10-3 L/ (mol\u00e2\u0302\u2122min)). \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

        "abstract": "The hydrothermal phase transition of ammonium titanate into TiO2 in aqueous ammonia media was investigated in the presence of F- ions by adding various kinds of electrolytes such as NaCl, NH4Cl, NaF, and NH4F. The phase composition and the morphologies of the products were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). With the assistance of F- ions, pure brookite TiO2 can be hydrothermally prepared with a wide range of Na+ ion concentrations from 0.25M to 1.5M in just 24h, which has obvious advantages over the previous NaCl scheme [1,2]. Moreover, photocatalytic degradation of MO shows that both anatase and brookite prepared in the presence of F- ions show superior photocatalytic activities than those prepared in the absence of F- ions. The phase transition mechanism from ammonium titanate into TiO2 was also proposed. Besides the introduction of Na+ ions that benefits the phase transition from titanate to brookite, F- ions are suggested to play two key roles during the hydrothermal process: catalyzing the condensation reaction of TiOH to produce TiOTi linkages by forming TiF and regulating the intercalation and the de-intercalation of Na+ ions by counteracting the electrostatic interaction between the Na+ ions and the titanate layers. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "A controllable and reproducible synthesis of highly ordered two-dimensional hexagonal mesoporous, crystalline bismuth-doped TiO(2) nanocomposites with variable Bi ratios is reported here. Analyses by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the well-ordered mesostructure is doped with Bi, which exists as Bi(3+) and Bi((3+x+)). The Bi-doped mesoporous TiO(2) (ms-TiO(2)) samples exhibit improved photocatalytic activities for simultaneous phenol oxidation and chromium reduction in aqueous suspension under visible and UV light over the pure ms-TiO(2), P-25, and conventional Bi-doped titania. The high catalytic activity is due to both the unique structural characteristics and the Bi doping. This new material extends the spectral response from UV to the visible region, and reduces electron-hole recombination, which renders the 2.0% Bi-doped ms-TiO(2) photocatalyst highly responsive to visible light.",

The Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), low-angle and wideangle X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy were used for the characterization of catalysts. The characteristic results clearly showed that Cd2+ ions were doped into the titania lattice, and the mesoporous architecture of Cd-doped TiO2 was composed of mixed-phase crystal textures of anatase and brookite. The samples displayed high visible-light photocatalytic activity for photodegradating 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) solution.

The samples were characterized by UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) specific surface area ( S BET ), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic absorption flame emission spectroscopy (AAS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was confirmed that Cr substitutes Ti 4+ in TiO 2 lattice in trivalent ionic state, and the concentrations of dopants Cr 3+ decrease from the exterior to the interior of doped TiO 2 . The photocatalytic activity of Cr-TiO 2 was investigated for the photocatalytic degradation of XRG aqueous solution both under UV and visible light irradiation. Due to the excitation of 3d electron of Cr 3+ to the conduction band of TiO 2 , Cr-TiO 2 shows a good ability for absorbing the visible light to degrade XRG. Doping of chromium ions effectively improves the photocatalytic activity under both UV light irradiation and visible light irradiation with an optimal doping concentration of 0.15% and 0.2%, respectively. The special distribution of dopants Cr 3+ seems having a good effect on enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Cr-TiO 2 .",

        "abstract": "By using water-soluble linear phenolic resin (PF) as C-source, a graphite-like carbonaceous surface modified TiO 2 photocatalyst (PF/TiO 2) was successfully synthesized through a hydrothermal process. The as-formed PF/TiO 2 exhibited significantly higher photocatalytic activity than bare TiO 2 toward the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible irradiation, while a tetrahydrofuran (THF) postrinsing operation can further enhance the photocatalytic activity of PF/TiO 2. To exploit the mystery of surface carbonaceous covering, a series of characterizations such as XPS, TG, TEM, and FTIR, as well as 1H NMR were employed. It is proposed that PF experienced a cross-linking and a carbonization process that are catalyzed by TiO 2 at the surface of TiO 2. The as-formed organics covering on the PF/TiO 2 seems composed of four portions from the surface of TiO 2 to the outside as oxidized graphite-like carbon (OGC), graphite-like carbon (GC), cross-linked PF (cl-PF), and PF. OGC and GC substances endow the catalysts visible absorption and photocatalytic activity, which are insoluble in the THF; meanwhile, PF and cl-PF are adverse to the visible light photocatalysis and can be rinsed out with THF. The visible light photocatalytic activity unrinsed PF/TiO 2 reaches its optimal condition at a PF dosage of 0.7 g (for 5.0 g titanium sulfate) while the THF rinsed PF/TiO 2 presents the highest photocatalytic activity with the maximum PF dosage in this work and gives a MO degradation rate of 100% in 4 h. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, Raman spectra, TEM, N(2) physical adsorption, XPS, and UV-vis absorption spectra. It was found that the co-doped TiO(2) has a larger BET surface areas and a narrower band gap than undoped TiO(2). The experimental results show that the coke carbon generated on the carbon doped TiO(2) surface act as a photosensitizer and has the photosensitization effect under the visible light. Except for carbon sensitization effect, the boron and carbon co-doped TiO(2) has synergistic effect which is responsible for effective photo-degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol in the visible light irradiation.",

The effect of PEG molecular weights and thermal treatment on the resultant structure and photocatalytic activity are investigated. Structural and phase compositional properties of the resultant photocatalysts are characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and nitrogen sorption analysis. When the molecular weights of PEG vary from 600 to 20,000, the particle sizes of mesoporous structure decrease from 15.1 to 13.3 nm and mean pore sizes increase from 6.9 to 10.6 nm. The chemical reactions of the formation of mesoporous-TiO 2 during its synthesis have been proposed and discussed. The activities of mesoporous-TiO 2 photocatalysts are evaluated and compared with Degussa P-25 using chloro-phenol as a testing compound.

The XRD patterns, HRTEM image and corresponding BET characterization show that it has ordered 2-D hexagonal pore channel and ultra thick pore wall (about 6\u00a0nm). The calcination can result in the vanishment of organic composite and the linkage of the hydrolyzed silica source and the hydrophobic chain (polymethylsiloxane) of the silica-based template. Hence this recombination process tremendously enhances the pore wall of the resulting mesoporous material and causes a certain amount of micropores in the wall.

        "abstract": "A feasible approach to synthesize pure brookite was achieved in an aqueous ammonia system via a hydrothermal process. By hydrothermal treatment of the titanate that directly hydrolyzed from tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT), a phase transition from titanate to TiO2 was observed with XRD. Anatase TiO2 was produced with an unobstructed closure of titanate layers. The phase transition process can be controlled by adding an electrolyte such as NaCl into the hydrothermal media. Na+ ions locally stop the direct closure of titanate layers at their adjacent position, which induce the formation of a brookite-like structure. The optimal hydrothermal reaction parameters for the crystal lattice formation of brookite in aqueous ammonia media were found to be 180\u00b0C, 0.5 M NaCl and \u226572 h. The phase transition process of titanate precursor to TiO2 depends heavily on the electrolyte. Metal cations play a crucial role in conducting the transition procedure from layered titanate into brookite or anatase. Na+ is preferred to conduct the phase transition from titanate to brookite rather than K+ and Li+. Although anions do not determine the phase transition rule during the hydrothermal process, they are influential in the phase transition process, as they can promote the phase transition by interacting with the TiO6 octahedra. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The physical properties of TiO2@C were studied by XRD, TG-DTA, HRTEM, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), while the chemical states of carbon were discussed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A graphite carbon layer was formed out of the TiO2 grain during the hydrothermal process via the dehydration of glucose, which consisted of not only Cn but also C-OH (and C-O-C) and CdO (and COO). TiO2@C has remarkable light absorption in the visible region. It was found that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2@C was greatly enhanced compared to noncarbon-TiO2 under visible irradiation. The photocatalyst with the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) was G15 TiO2@C, while that for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) was G5 TiO 2@C. Two kinds of sensitization processes, carbon sensitization and dye sensitization, are responsible for the visible lightinduced photocatalysis of TiO2@C. Carbon sensitization reached its optimal condition in G5, while dye sensitization occurred in its maximum efficiency in G15. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

The catalyst samples were prepared in a homogeneous precipitation\u2013hydrothermal process and characterized by XRD, XPS, UV\u2013DRS and BET analyses. The results indicated that the nitrogen and La 3+ doping could inhibit the phase transformation and crystallite growth of TiO 2 and enhance the thermal stability of TiO 2 structure. In addition, the experiment results showed that the thermal stability of TiO 2 increased with the increasing of La 3+ doping. The photocatalytic activities of samples for photodegradation of rhodamine B under visible light irradiation using different La 3+ doping contents were also studied. There were optimal values of La 3+ doping content for the La 3+ doped and nitrogen/La 3+ co-doped TiO 2 corresponding the highest photodegradation percentages. The nitrogen and La 3+ co-doped titania could greatly improve the photocatalytic activity in visible light irradiation, whose probable mechanism is a synergistic effect of co-doping. The nitrogen doping could narrow the band gap of titania and enhance the utilization efficiency of visible light, while the La 3+ doping could accelerate the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. Furthermore, the La 3+ doping could increase the adsorption of organic pollutants on the surface of photocatalyst.",

The N, B, Si-tridoped mesoporous TiO2 showed small crystallite size, large specific surface area (350 m2/g), uniform pore distribution (3.2 nm) and strong absorption in the visible light region. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the photodegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) aqueous solution. The N, B, Si-tridoping sample exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity compared with other synthesized photocatalysts. The high activity could be attributed to the strong absorption in the visible light region, large specific surface area, small crystallite size, large amount of surface hydroxyl groups, and mesoporosity. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.",

In recent years, silver halide (AgX)-based photocatalytic materials have received increasing research attention owing to its excellent visible light-driven photocatalytic performances in the applications of organic pollutant degradation, H2/O2 generation, and disinfection. AgX-based materials used in photocatalytic fields can be classified into three categories: AgX (Ag/AgX), AgX composites, and supported AgX materials. For the AgX (Ag/AgX) photocatalysts, it has been widely accepted that the final photocatalytic performances of photocatalysts are severely dependent on their morphological structures as well as exposed crystal facets. As a result, considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricating different morphological AgX photocatalysts as well as exploring the relationship between the morphological structures and photocatalytic performances. In this review, we mainly introduce the recent developments made in fabricating morphology and facet-controllable AgX (Ag/AgX) photocatalytic materials. Moreover, this review also deals with the photocatalytic mechanism and applications of AgX (Ag/AgX) and supported AgX materials.",

It was revealed that Ag@AgBr can remain stable under weak light sources while it will become unstable under strong light sources. Electron quenchers are favorable to improving the stability of Ag@AgBr while hole quenchers do the opposite. Acting as a sensitizer, acid orange 7 dye is detrimental to the stability of Ag@AgBr.

DCMS can selectively recognize Cu2+ without disturbance by other metal ions in acetonitrile. Furthermore, the DCMS solution showed a distinguishable color change visible to the naked eye after addition of Cu2+. DCMS for Cu2+ sensing in acetonitrile had a remarkably low detection limit of 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM, which is 1\u00a0% of the toxicity level in drinking water defined by the US Environment Protection Agency (USEPA). Interestingly, the results suggest that the Cu2+ sensing mechanism may be involved in a redox reaction between Cu2+ and DCMS.",

The prepared co-modified catalysts were characterized by XRD, UV-DRS, XPS, EPR, etc. The characterization results indicate that the catalysts have a typical anatase crystalline form, and that some Co2+ are incorporated on the surface of TiO2, leading to the formation of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies. The impurity levels induced by Co2+ and Ti3+ doping are the reason for the enhanced visible light absorption, and the synergistic effect of cobalt, Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies is responsible for the improvement of photo-catalytic activity.",

In addition, fluorescence of these dyes in solid state was also measured. Intramolecular charge transfer was confirmed within the new dyes by virtue of shifts in emission maximum with increasing solvent polarity.

The microstructures and chemical compositions of the obtained films were analyzed by the means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermo gravimetry/differential thermal analyzer, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was revealed that the 3D network structure was formed via the cross-linking reaction between gelatin and cross-linking agent 1,3-bis(vinylsulfonyl) propanol (BVP). Photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange indicated that Ag@AgBr-gelatin film exhibited excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity and recyclability, due to the reason that the 3D networks can efficiently fix Ag@AgBr but hardly hinder the transmissions of reactants and degradation products. The adhesion fastness of Ag@AgBr-gelatin film on nylon mesh enhances with increasing the dosage of cross-linking agent BVP, and the lower limit of BVP dosage for forming unbroken film is 0.02\u00a0g/m2. Excessive cross-linking would make gelatin network structure too denser, resulting in the decline of photocatalytic activity.",

Probe possesses the widely-used thiol-selective 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl (DNBS) group which can react with thiol and release the fluorescein which has strong fluorescence. Fluorescein, a well known xanthene fluorescent dye, has two states at different environment. Fluorescein is in the state of spirocyclization when connected with 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl (DNBS) group which has no fluorescence. However, it is in the state of open form when it reacts with thiol which has a strong fluorescence. The transition of the two states can be used to selectively detect thiol and the color can change from colorless to yellow which can be differentiated by naked eyes. Upon the titration of thiol, the absorption band at 454\u00a0nm rises gradually and the fluorescence emerges at 521\u00a0nm and the detection limit can be as low as 0.16\u00a0\u03bcM.

The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol indicates that the photocatalytic activities of the synthesized samples show an increasing tendency in the order of CeO 2  2  2 -90\u00a0 2 -180 (CdS@CeO 2  samples treated at 90\u00a0\u00b0C and 180\u00a0\u00b0C were denoted as CdS@CeO 2 -90 and CdS@CeO 2 -180, respectively). It was revealed that the redox couple Ce 4+ /Ce 3+  in CeO 2  shell not only promotes the separation of electron-hole pairs but also favors the transfer of electrons from the inner layer of CeO 2  shell to its outer layer. Hydrothermal treatment can increase the contents of Ce 3+  and chemisorbed oxygen, by which the photocatalytic activity can be enhanced. The radical scavenging experiments proved that in acetonitrile solution\u2009 O 2  \u2212  and hole are the main reactive species responsible for the transformation from benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.",

Therefore, it is of significance to develop an effective method to detect the trace SO 2  derivatives\u2014SO 3  2\u2212  and HSO 3  \u2212 . Herein, we synthesized a semi-cyanine-coumarin hybrid dye for detection of SO 3  2\u2212  and HSO 3  \u2212 . Based on the nucleophilic addition of HSO 3  \u2212 /SO 3  2\u2212  to the vinyl group, Probe 1 showed high response speed, selectivity, and sensitivity towards SO 3  2\u2212  and HSO 3  \u2212 . Upon addition of HSO 3  \u2212 /SO 3  2\u2212 , color obviously changes from blue to yellow which can be differentiated by naked eyes. Probe 1 displays colorimetric and ratiometric response toward HSO 3  \u2212  and SO 3  2\u2212 . The detection limit is as low as 27.6\u00a0nM and the signal-to-background ratio in fluorescence intensity can reach 35-folds. Moreover, Probe 1 showed high selectivity and anti-interference ability in the co-existence of the environmental and biologic species.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Silver halide-based photocatalytic materials have been successfully used in organic contaminant degradation and disinfection, but their application in the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes has never been reported. Herein, we fabricated sandwich-structured AgBr@Ag@TiO 2  composite photocatalyst by a facile multistep route and for the first time studied its photocatalytic performance for the oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes. It was found that the porous TiO 2  shell layer can be successfully anchored on the surface of AgBr core by a kinetics-controlled hydrolysis process and the thickness of TiO 2  shell layer can be conveniently tuned by adjusting the addition amount of ammonia water during titanium source hydrolysis. The control experiments indicated that the O 2  plays a vital role in promoting the oxidation of benzyl alcohols while non-aqueous solvents are favorable to improving the reaction selectivity from alcohol to aldehyde. Compared to blank TiO 2  and AgBr@Ag, sandwich-structured AgBr@Ag@TiO 2  exhibited a drastically enhanced photocatalytic activity in terms of benzyl alcohol oxidation under visible light irradiation. The transient photocurrent and photoluminescence (PL) spectrum analyses confirmed that the core-shell structure can effectively promote the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. The radical scavenging experiments revealed that superoxide radical (   O 2  \u2212 ) and hole (h + ) are the main reactive species responsible for the transformation from benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes.",

        "abstract": "The solar energy conversion efficiency of semiconductor materials is closely related to the separation rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Recently, \u201cfacet heterojunctions\u201d have attracted much attention because of their outstanding capability for separating the photogenerated charge carriers. In this research, silver bromide (AgBr) crystals with different exposed facets were synthesized using a double-jet precipitation method using the inherent bromide (Br\u2212) ions as the structure directing agent. The morphology and exposed facets of the AgBr crystals were conveniently tailored by adjusting the concentration of Br\u2212 ions, i.e., cubes with {100} facets, tetradecahedrons with both {100} and {111} facets, and octahedrons with {111} facets were synthesized when the concentrations of Br\u2212 ions were 10\u22123.0, 10\u22122.5, and 10\u22122.0 M, respectively. Br\u2212 ions can clearly decrease the surface energies of the (100) and (111) surfaces, by which the growth rate of AgBr nuclei along the [100] and [111] directions can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of Br\u2212 ions, leading to the formation of AgBr crystals with different exposed facets. The transient photocurrent, electrochemical impedance, and photoluminescence spectrum measurements indicated that the tetradecahedral AgBr crystals show higher electron\u2013hole separation rate than the cubic and octahedral ones. Mott\u2013Schottky and photo-oxidation deposition experiments revealed that the photogenerated electrons and holes are transferred to AgBr {100} and {111} facets, respectively. The benefit from the effective spatial isolation of photogenerated electrons and holes was that tetradecahedral AgBr crystals with co-exposed {100} and {111} facets showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange and sulfadiazine.",

It was found that the probe RT showed high response speed and selectivity toward Cys and GSH over other amino acids. After reacting with Cys/GSH, it shows a strong red fluorescence, corresponding to a color change from colorless to purple, which can be easily discriminated by the naked eye. The detection limit of the probe RT is as low as 24\u00a0nM to Cys and 20\u00a0nM to GSH. All these advantages of the probe RT make it possible for the quantitative detection of small-molecule thiols such as Cys and GSH in living organisms.",

        "abstract": "Thiophenols are a class of highly toxic pollutant compounds, which can cause severe damage to the central nervous system and other nervous systems after long-term exposure. Therefore, it is of significance to develop an effective method to detect trace thiophenols in the environment. Herein, we synthesized a dicyanoisophorone-based near-infrared fluorescent probe (probe 1) with large stokes shift (\u03bbem\u2009\u2212\u2009\u03bbabs\u2009=\u2009203\u00a0nm) for the selective detection of thiophenols. Probe 1 exhibited very high response speed (less than 200 S), sensitivity, and selectivity towards thiophenols, regardless of the presence of aliphatic thiols and other analytes. The detection limit was as low as 3.4\u00a0nM and the signal-to-background ratio of fluorescence intensity reached 30. Moreover, probe 1 displayed ultrasensitivity and high reliability in the quantitative detection of trace thiophenol in three river water samples.",

        "abstract": "A Z-scheme heterogeneous photocatalyst CdS\u2013Au\u2013BiVO4 was synthesized for the first time by photo-reduction and deposition\u2013precipitation methods. The microstructures and optical properties of the as-prepared samples were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Due to the oriented accumulation of electrons on the {010} facets of BiVO4 crystals, Au nanoparticles were successfully anchored on the {010} facets of BiVO4 crystals via the photo-reduction process. CdS was further selectively deposited on the surface of Au nanoparticles, benefitting from the strong S\u2013Au interaction. Photocatalytic degradations of tetracycline and Rhodamine B indicated that CdS\u2013Au\u2013BiVO4 exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity than BiVO4, Au\u2013BiVO4, and CdS\u2013BiVO4. Radical trapping experiments confirmed that in the case of CdS\u2013Au\u2013BiVO4, the main reactive species responsible for organic contaminant degradation are h+, \u02d9OH, and \u02d9O2\u2212, while only h+ can be produced in the case of CdS\u2013BiVO4. Based on the photoelectrochemical analysis and radical trapping experiments, it can be deduced that the Z-scheme structure of CdS\u2013Au\u2013BiVO4 not only decreases the recombination rate of photo-generated carriers but also makes the holes and electrons keep a higher redox ability.",

It was found that Au nanoparticles were successfully anchored on the surface of SnS2, and CdS nanoparticles were further deposited on the surface Au nanoparticles by the strong interaction of S\u2013Au. Compared to SnS2, CdS, SnS2\u2013Au, and SnS2\u2013CdS, Z-scheme structure SnS2\u2013Au\u2013CdS shows the best photocatalytic performance for methyl orange (MO) degradation and Cr(VI) reduction under visible light irradiation. The outstanding photocatalytic performance of SnS2\u2013Au\u2013CdS can be ascribed to the special Z-scheme structure which not only improves the separation of photogenerated charge carriers but also preserves its high redox ability. In addition, SnS2\u2013Au\u2013CdS exhibited synergistic effects in photocatalytic removal of Cr(VI) and MO.",

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrum analysis (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectra, thermogravimetric analysis, and UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were carried out to characterize the composites with different catechol contents and different preparation temperatures. The photocatalytic degradation of Acid Orange 7 was chosen as a model reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the modified catalysts. Results showed that TiO2 nanoparticles were chemically modified by catechol leading to the shifting of the onset wavelength of the optical absorption in the visible range. The modification did not change the crystalline structure of the TiO2 nanoparticles according to the XRD patterns. Through XPS analyses, it was confirmed that the catechol was anchored and saturated on the TiO2 surface by reacting with the surface hydroxyl to form a bidentate mononuclear structure. The photocatalytic studies suggested that the in situ-modified TiO2 photocatalysts showed enhanced photocatalytic efficiency compared to the pure TiO2 under visible-light irradiation. The optimum preparation condition was found at a weight ratio of 4.0\u00a0wt% (catechol/TiO2).",

        "abstract": "In this paper, p\u2013n type CuInS{sub 2}/TiO{sub 2} particles were prepared in ethylenediamine by the solvothermal method. The microstructural properties of the synthesized p\u2013n type catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to confirm the existence of crystalline CuInS{sub 2} on the surface of TiO{sub 2}, which was also confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images provided the detailed morphological properties about the CuInS{sub 2}/TiO{sub 2} heterostructure. UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis DRS) was used to investigate the optical properties of the CuInS{sub 2}/TiO{sub 2} particles. The DRS results indicated that both the p\u2013n type structure and CuInS{sub 2} acting as a sensitizer can enhance significantly the absorption of UV and visible light. The photocatalytic activities of the CuInS{sub 2}/TiO{sub 2} particles were evaluated by hydrogen evolution reactions using Xe-lamp irradiation as a simulated solar light source. The greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution under simulated solar light is about ~7 fold higher than that of pure commercial TiO{sub 2} (Degussa P25). - Graphical abstract: The heterojunction structure of CuInS{sub 2}/TiO{sub 2} promoted the efficiency of photoinduced charge carrier transfer and highly inherited the recombination of activated electrons and holes. - Highlight: \u2022more\u00a0\u00bb CuInS{sub 2}/TiO{sub 2} was prepared by a one-step solvothermal method. \u2022 2.5% CuInS{sub 2}/TiO{sub 2} has the highest activity and keeps the activity stable. \u2022 Heterojunction structure of sample promoted the separation of electrons and holes.\u00ab\u00a0less",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We employ a one-step vacuum activation method to obtain Ti 3+  and N co-doped TiO 2  photocatalysts with high reactivity under visible light. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized with XRD, UV\u2013vis absorption spectra, XPS, EPR, and BET. The characterization results indicate that the co-doped photocatalysts have a relative small crystallite size and high surface area. After the vacuum activation, the Ti 3+  is generated in the bulk of TiO 2  and the nitrogen is transferred from the surface to the lattice of TiO 2 . The vacuum activated TiO 2  catalysts have revealed an improvement over pure TiO 2  under visible light irradiation both in optical absorption and photocatalytic activity. It suggests that vacuum activated procedure can not only produce Ti 3+  in the bulk of TiO 2  to improve its visible-light activity but also can be a good method to further introduce some anionic species for the doping such as nitrogen element which is good for band-gap narrowing. In addition, the enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity of the catalyst does not rely on the sacrifice of the photocatalytic activity under UV-light irradiation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Mixed-phase TiO 2  photocatalysts with different proportions of anatase and rutile have been successfully synthesized in an acidic hydrothermal system, using tartaric acid (C 4 H 6 O 6 ) as a phase content regulator and titanium trichloride (TiCl 3 ) as the titanium source. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and so on. The phase contents of anatase and rutile in the TiO 2  particles were successfully controlled by simply adjusting the molar ratio of C 4 H 6 O 6  to TiCl 3 . And the regulation degree could be further controlled by the concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the reaction system. In addition, the effect of the reaction time, hydrothermal temperature and acidity on the phase structure of as-prepared products have also been investigated. A mechanism was proposed to interpret the evolution of the phases based on the experimental results. Finally, the photocatalytic activity of the prepared TiO 2  were evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solutions. The mixed-phase TiO 2  exhibited higher activity than pure phase TiO 2 , and the catalyst containing 77% anatase and 23% rutile had the highest photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be explained by the mixed-phase effect between anatase and rutile.",

        "abstract": "Well dispersed TiO2 nanocrystals with (001) facets were successfully grown in situ on g-C3N4 through a facial solvothermal method. The resultant TiO2/g-C3N4 composites exhibit remarkably higher efficiency for photocatalytic degradation of phenol as compared to pure catalysts (g-C3N4 or TiO2) or mechanically mixed TiO2/g-C3N4. The optimal composite with 11.2 wt% TiO2 showed the highest degradation rate constant, which is 2.8 times that of pure g-C3N4, 2.2 times that of pure TiO2, and 1.4 times that of mechanically mixed TiO2/g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the effective charge separation derived from two aspects: (1) well matched energy levels between TiO2 and g-C3N4 and (2) a uniform and close contact between TiO2 and g-C3N4 that resulted from the in situ growth of highly dispersed TiO2 nanocrystals. The TiO2/g-C3N4 hybrid material prepared in this study is expected to provide a good foundation for the further design and synthesis of advanced TiO2/g-C3N4-based functional materials, and the in situ growth method developed is hopeful to provide a new strategy for the synthesis of other semiconductor-modified g-C3N4 materials.

Moreover, the raw materials for the preparation of g-CN are various and easily accessible. All of these have provided favorable advantages for the fast development of g-CN. Compared to bulk g-CN, mesoporous g-CN has more prominent natures, such as high specific surface area, large pore volume, and the increased amount of surface active sites. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted to develop mesoporous g-CN (MCN). Up to now, many methods have been explored for the synthesis of MCN, such as hard-template method, soft-template method, template-free method, sol\u2013gel method, and so on. Among these methods, the hard template method is used most widely. In this paper, the recent research on the synthesis of MCN was reviewed. In addition, the modifications to the obtained MCN, which lead to performance enhancement of the MCN for better applications, were also summarized.",

Characterization by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and a vibrating sample magnetometer reveals monodispersed superparamagnetic Fe3O4@SiO2@CdS NPs (ca. 250 nm) have been formed with a uniform CdS shell thickness of ca. 20 nm, Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area of ca. 25.1 m2 g\u22121 and saturation magnetization of 22.02 emu g\u22121. This composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation with a reaction constant of 1.95 \u00d7 10\u22122 min\u22121 in spite of the low weight percentage of CdS (9.15%) as determined by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which is higher than those observed on Fe3O4@CdS (53.30%, 1.22 \u00d7 10\u22122 min\u22121) and CdS NPs (3.33 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121). Furthermore, Fe3O4@SiO2@CdS can be quickly magnetically recovered within 30 s by applying an external magnetic field near the solution after the photocatalytic process, which still preserves the excellent particle monodispersity with the slightly reduced CdS thickness (ca. 15 nm), while Fe3O4@CdS and CdS NPs are severely photo-corroded and aggregated. The maximized specific surface area from uniform coating and the efficient generation of activated oxygen species from CdS shells might be responsible for the enhanced photoactivity.",

Owing to the stable core-shell structural framework and conductive mesoporous carbon matrix, the as-prepared MoO @NC shows a high specific capacity of around 700\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g at a current of 0.5\u2005A\u2009g , excellent cycling stability up to 100\u2005cycles, and superior rate performance. The N-doped mesoporous carbon can greatly improve the conductivity and provide uninhibited conducting pathways for fast charge transfer and transport. Moreover, the core-shell structure improved the structural integrity, leading to a high stability during the cycling process. All of these merits make the MoO @NC to be a suitable and promising material for lithium ion battery.",

Yolk-shell structured TiO-type lithium ion sieve is further transformed from C@LiTiO through the acid treatment, which have a high specific surface area of 201.74\u202fm/g. The composite shows adsorption capacity towards Li proportional to the pH value in the range of 7-13. The adsorption reaches equilibrium within 2\u202fh with a high equilibrium adsorption capacity of 28.46\u202fmg/g under alkaline conditions, which is ca. 8 times the value of ordinary TiO lithium ion sieve with comparable size and surface area, demonstrating the enhanced adsorption is attributed to the generation of more accessible surficial voids by replacing internal part with light carbon core. The adsorption follows Freundlich and pseudo-second-order kinetic models with a high rate constant of 0.015\u202fg/(mg\u00b7min).

        "abstract": "Abstract   Herein, we demonstrate the yolk-shell structured Fe 3 O 4 @void@TiO 2  sphere as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the photo-Fenton-like degradation of tetracycline (TC). The composite was synthesized by first successively coating amorphous SiO 2  and TiO 2  shells around a Fe 3 O 4  core via the sol-gel strategy to form Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @TiO 2 , then crystallizing TiO 2  and removing SiO 2  through calcination and the ultrasonic ammonia-etching treatment, respectively. The particles are monodisperse and uniform in size (ca. 180\u00a0nm), where the diameter of the core is ca. 100\u00a0nm and the thickness of the shell is ca. 10\u00a0nm. This composite possesses anatase TiO 2  shell with high crystallinity, superparamagnetic core with a saturation magnetization value of 28.71 emu/g and high specific surface area of 101\u00a0m 2 \u00a0g \u22121 . It shows extremely high activity towards the degradation of TC (40\u00a0mg/L) in a wide pH range as demonstrated by almost 100% elimination efficiency at pH\u00a0=\u00a03 and ca. 75% at pH\u00a0=\u00a09 within 6\u00a0min. Moreover, benefitting from the superparamagnetism of the core, this composite could be magnetically recovered and reapplied in the TC degradation without significant loss of activity after 5 recycling (ca. 10%). The degradation curve can be well fitted by pseudo-first order model, where a kinetic constant of 0.51\u00a0min \u22121  is achieved, much higher than those of Fe 3 O 4 @TiO 2  (0.24\u00a0min \u22121 ), hollow TiO 2  (0.17\u00a0min \u22121 ), Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @TiO 2  (0.14\u00a0min \u22121 ) and Fe 3 O 4  (0.11\u00a0min \u22121 ). The high activity is attributed to the efficient enrichment and confinement of reactants (TC and hydroxyl radicals) in the nanocavity of the yolk-shell structure, and the efficient reduction of Fe 3+  to Fe 2+  by the photo-generated electrons from the TiO 2  shell.",

The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared TiO 2 /Co-g-C 3 N 4  catalyst was evaluated by the degradation of phenol in the presence of Cr 6\u00a0+  under simulated sunlight irradiation. The catalyst exhibited markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity for degradation of phenol but obviously decreased photocatalytic activity for reduction of Cr 6\u00a0+  compared with common TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4  catalyst. The mechanism for this photocatalytic performance was proposed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, the Fe 2 O 3 -SiO 2  composite photo-Fenton catalyst was designed and synthesized as a photonic crystal with a hierarchical macro-mesoporous structure, which possesses a slow-light-effect region that overlaps with the absorption spectrum of methyl orange (MO). The prepared material exhibits remarkably high and stable photo-Fenton catalytic performance for the degradation of MO using only a low concentration of H 2 O 2  under visible light irradiation. The catalytic activity of the as-prepared material is better than that of the corresponding macroporous or mesoporous Fe 2 O 3 -SiO 2  composites as well as commercial Fe 2 O 3  or the homogenous photo-Fenton system of FeCl 3 \u202f\u00b7\u202f6H 2 O. The efficient use of H 2 O 2  and the high catalytic activity are attributed to (i) the excellent adsorption of MO by the hierarchical macro-mesoporous structure and (ii) enhanced light harvesting from coupling the absorption spectrum of MO with the slow-light-effect region of the photonic crystal. This hierarchical macro-mesoporous Fe 2 O 3 -SiO 2  photonic crystal is expected to be a promising cost-effective photo-Fenton catalyst for degradation of a variety of dyes by deliberately tuning its slow-light-effect region, and opens up new perspectives for the development of highly efficient photo-Fenton catalysts for environmental remediation technology.",

        "abstract": "The rational design and controlled synthesis of a smart device with flexibly tailored response ability is all along desirable for bioapplication but long remains a considerable challenge. Here, a pH-stimulated valve system with a visualized \"on-off\" mode is constructed through a dual-shell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) strategy. The dual shells refer to carbon dots and fluorescent molecules embedded polymethacrylic acid (F-PMAA) layers successively coating around a SiO2 core (ca. 120 nm), which play the roles as energy donor and acceptor, respectively. The total thickness of the dual-shell in the solid composite is ca. 10 nm. The priorities of this dual-shell FRET nanovalve stem from three facts: (1) the thin shell allows the formation of efficient FRET system without chemical bonding between energy donor and acceptor; (2) the maximum emission wavelength of CD layer is tunable in the range of 400-600 nm, thus providing a flexible energy donor for a wide variety of energy acceptors; (3) the outer F-PMAA shell with a pH-sensitive swelling-shrinking (on-off) behavior functions as a valve for regulating the FRET process. As such, a sensitive and stable pH ratiometric sensor with a working pH range of 3-6 has been built by simply encapsulating pH-responsive fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) into PMAA; a pH-dependent swelling-shrinking shuttle carrier with a finely controllable molecule-release behavior has been further fabricated using rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBITC) as the energy donor and model guest molecule. Significantly, the controlled releasing process is visually self-monitorable. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, carbon nitride was loaded into the titanium incorporated SBA-15 mesoporous silica (denoted as Ti-SBA15-CN) by a two-step vapor condensation of dicyandiamide. The as-prepared sample was characterized by various spectroscopy techniques. Photocatalytic reduction of Cr (VI) in aqueous solution was investigated using Ti-SBA15-CN under visible-light irradiation. By introducing Ti into the SBA-15 framework structure, the visible light driven photocatalytic activity of the obtained Ti-SBA15-CN was higher than SBA15-CN and the photocatalytic activity exhibited a rise with the increase of Ti contents. It was because the presence of Ti moiety could promote the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers in carbon nitride, leading to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. The addition of phenol further enhanced the photocatalytic reduction of Cr (VI). Similarly, the presence of Cr (VI) promoted the degradation of phenol. The synergistic effect between the reduction of Cr (VI) and the degradation of phenol provided salutary method for purification of the complex waste water and environmental restoration.",

The as-prepared g-C 3 N 4  exhibited a porous thin sheet like structure with a larger surface area and showed an efficient separation efficiency for radiative charge carriers. The textural structure and morphology of the porous g-C 3 N 4  materials were well characterized by TEM, SEM, XRD, BET, FT-IR, Raman, XPS, UV\u2013vis DRS and PL spectroscopy. The starch mediated porous g-C 3 N 4  photocatalyst demonstrated significantly an enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance and excellent physicochemical stability for the photodegradation of organic pollutants (including rhodamine B and phenol). The results revealed that, the optimized gaseous template contents had a significant influence on photooxidative chemical reaction of the as-prepared samples. The radical scavenging experiments proved that holes and  O 2  \u2212  are the main reactive species responsible for the visible light degradation of rhodamine B. This simple, economical and green strategy using starch as gaseous porogen agent for the fabrication of porous g-C 3 N 4  with excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity is desirable for environmental remediation and solar energy applications.",

        "abstract": "Optimizing the heterojunction structure of semiconductor photocatalysts is vital for utilizing their abilities in organic matter degradation. Herein, a novel fabrication of a Z-scheme system with inverse opal g-C3N4 and BiOBr via a reflux process is developed. On the one hand, the unique inverse opal construction, formed by using silica (SiO2) photonic crystals as the template, not only provides a larger surface area for adsorption of antibiotics but also improves the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes as well as visible light absorption ability. On the other hand, by imitating natural photosynthesis, the artificial Z-scheme system with an inverse opal g-C3N4-BiOBr nanojunction further promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The obtained IO CN/BiOBr catalyst exhibits superior photocatalytic performance for antibiotics degradation under visible light irradiation. In a typical test, almost complete degradation of levofloxacin (LVX) (10 mg L-1) could be achieved within 50 min due to the proper bandgap match between inverse opal g-C3N4 and BiOBr as well as enhanced surface area and light absorption. The present work provides an alternative strategy for construction of novel visible-light-driven Z-scheme photocatalysts and offers some new insights into the methods of waste water treatment.",

The as-prepared Fe3O4@void@CdS NPs (ca. 200 nm) possess good monodispersity and a uniform CdS shell of ca.15 nm. This composite exhibits excellent photo-Fenton (ph-F) activity toward the degradation of methylene blue (MB) in a wide pH working range of 4.5-11 under the visible light irradiation. A series of control experiments demonstrate the unique Y-S structure contributes to the enhanced activity, where the separation of hole-electron pair from CdS and the reduction of Fe(2+) from Fe(3+) are mutually promoted. The similar efficiency can also be achieved when the shell component changes to TiO2 or CeO2, demonstrating a general strategy for the design of robust ph-F agent. ",

CNQDs/CN IO exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity in the removal of organic pollutant represented by phenol\uff0cwhich can be ascribed to (i) the inverse opal structure enhances the light harvesting, facilitates mass transfer and provides adequate surface area for photocatalytic reactions; (ii) the incorporation of CNQDs in the framework of g-C3N4 promotes photo-generated charge separation and transfer across the interfaces between CN IO and CNQDs, leading to excellent photoelectronchemical properties.

The composite catalyst was successfully fabricated by growth of CoP nanoparticles on the surface of g-C3N4. The CoP nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surface of g-C3N4 and could interact with g-C3N4 to make charge separation and electron transfer improved. The results of catalytic experiments showed that the composite catalyst had a superior catalytic activity as compared with pure CoP or g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. The optimal catalyst with 1.76 wt% CoP loading amount exhibited the best photocatalytic efficiency with a H2O2 production of 140 uM in 2 h, which is about 4.6 and 23.3 times that of pure g-C3N4 and pure CoP, respectively. The possible mechanism on the visible-light-driven photocatalytic production of H2O2 was proposed. And the composite catalyst exhibited stable performance without obvious loss of catalytic activity after seven successive runs, showing a good application prospect for sustainable H2O2 production.",

Here, ordered macroporous TiO 2  that is concomitantly photocatalytically active and high surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensitive was unprecedentedly employed to self-track the photocatalytic reaction using the oxidation of  p -aminothiophenol (PATP) as the model. The photocatalytic degradation under 532\u00a0nm laser irradiation initiated from the formation of the azo compound was explicitly revealed by finely resolved SERS spectra. More importantly, the decomposition rates of different bonds including N N, C S and C C were respectively determined, following a first-order kinetics process with the rates in the range of 2.1\u20132.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 \u00a0s \u22121 .

        "abstract": "Abstract   Photocatalytic fixation of nitrogen under the mild condition is a green and promising ammonia synthesis strategy, which however is still a big challenge due to the high activation energy for nitrogen. Herein, we report the photocatalytic fixation of nitrogen on TiO 2  (B) nanotubes with large specific surface area (344m 2 /g), the ultrathin shell and submicrometer-sized cavity (ca. 250 nm). A high yield of 106.6 \u03bcmolg \u22121 \u2009h \u22121  for NH 3  under simulated sunlight irradiation was achieved at room temperature, which is 1.61 times the yield on TiO 2  nanosheets. Based on the results from EPR, photoluminescence and photo-electrochemical analyses, the improved activity is attributed to the efficient nitrogen activation by the abundant surface defects and the enhanced light utilization on nanotube with the multiple light-scattering effect. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2  (B) nanotubes can be well preserved for 4 cycles. This study provides a new approach for rational designing of efficient photocatalysts toward stable and robust nitrogen fixation in mild conditions.",

The morphology of TiO 2  products can be tuned by simply adjusting the experimental parameters, such as the amounts of HF and urea, reaction time, reaction temperature and the concentration of titanate precursor. The photocatalytic activity of TiO 2  catalysts with different morphologies were evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO). The experimental results have demonstrated that catalysts with different morphologies have different photocatalytic activities. Along with many advantages of the synthesis process, such as being surfactant-free and easy to operate, the synthesis method developed in this study provides a new inspiration for further investigation into the preparation of TiO 2  catalysts with advanced structures and high photocatalytic activity.",

        "abstract": "New polymer composites consisting of poly(diphenylbutadiyne) (PDPB) and g-C3N4 have been successfully prepared. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra show that the existence of PDPB in composites can clearly increase the visible light absorption of the catalysts. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements reveal that PDPB can effectively facilitate the charge carrier separation in the composites. Compared with pure g-C3N4 or pure PDPB, the composite catalysts exhibit observably enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for degradation of RhB and phenol. A possible mechanism for the charge separation and transfer in the composite catalysts is proposed. In addition, the composite catalysts show stable catalytic performance after five successive runs, displaying potential for applications in various fields of photocatalysis.",

        "abstract": "The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 was restricted by the fast charge recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. In this work, a g-C3N4 metal-free composite modified with g-C3N4 quantum dots (CNQDs) (CNQDs/CN) was successfully prepared by a simple solvothermal method aiming to greatly promote the charge separation rate. The CNQDs/CN composite was confirmed by HRTEM and XPS measurements and exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity in the degradation of organic pollutants represented by Rhodamine B. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of the CNQDs/CN composite can be ascribed to the effective charge separation and transfer across the interfaces between g-C3N4 and CNQDs, which benefits from the excellent photoelectrochemical properties as well as the prolonged lifetime of charge carriers. The self-modification strategy provides a rational and interesting design idea to fabricate highly efficient photocatalysts.",

The key to the simultaneous growth of single crystal and the introduction of hierarchical pores is the assembly of PS and titania at the glassification temperature of PS (100\u202f\u00b0C). During the hydrolytic polymerization of TiF, PS is encapsulated inside titania and gradually glassified. The interference from elastic PS on the oriental growth of TiO crystallite is thus minimized and the final removal of PS through calcination leaves interconnected macropore and mesopore inside the single crystal. According to XPS, EPR and fluorescence analyses, abundant oxygen vacancies are formed on the hierarchical porous single crystal, which presents extraordinary photocatalytic activity and stability in degrading organic pollutants under simulated sunlight irradiation using Rhodamine B as the model. The improved photocatalytic activity is a synergistic effect of improved separation of charge carrier and facilitated interfacial charge transfer benefitting from highly accessible porous single crystal structure.",

This Minireview presents the recent development of noble-metal-free materials as SERS substrates and their potential applications, especially semiconductors and emerging graphene-based nanostructures. Rather than providing an exhaustive review of this field, possible contributions from semiconductor substrates, characteristics of graphene enhanced Raman scattering, as well as effect factors such as surface plasmon resonance, structure and defects of the nanostructures that are considered essential for SERS activity are emphasized. The intention is to illustrate, through these examples, that the promise of noble-metal-free materials for enhancing detection sensitivity can further fuel the development of SERS-related applications.",

Devising a simple modification strategy for the improved photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4  has always been desired. Herein, we report a spherical worm-like g-C 3 N 4  nanostructure via facile ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS) gaseous bubbles templating approach. This strategy employing ALS as gaseous bubbles templating agent bestowed not only g-C 3 N 4  with improved specific surface areas, a porous structure with more exposed photocatalytic reactive sites and mass diffusion of reactants molecules, but also rendered extended optical absorption range and suppression of the photoinduced charge carriers recombination. As a result, the ALS-mediated g-C 3 N 4  photocatalysts unfolded excellent photocatalytic performance regarding photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol under visible photoirradiation. Additionally, the quenching effects of various scavengers proved that the holes (h + ) and superoxide anions (   O 2  \u2212 ) radicals were the main active species responsible for ameliorated photocatalytic performance for rhodamine B and phenol photodegradation. Our work offers a straightforward approach for developing high-performance metal free photocatalysts with great potential for environmental remediation.",

In the current review, the cutting-edge research progress in the synthesis and design of high-efficiency g-C3N4-based nanomaterial photocatalysts with controllable structures and morphologies will be rationally discussed with special focus on a plenitude of not only photocatalytic applications in pollutant degradation and bacterial disinfection, but also photoredox applications towards H2 production from water splitting, photocatalytic O2 reduction to produce H2O2, N2 photofixation, and photoreduction of CO2. Finally, this critical review will conclude with a summary and some outlooks on the ongoing challenges, which provide new research opportunities for the advancement of g-C3N4-based metal-free nanomaterial photocatalysts. It is envisaged that this review article will shed light on and pave the way for new research avenues for the rational design and synthesis of the next generations of g-C3N4 heterogeneous photocatalysts for the advancement of a sustainable future.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a highly efficient heterogeneous photo-Fenton system (Fe2O3/g-C3N4/H2O2/visible light) has been developed. The heterogeneous catalyst Fe2O3/g-C3N4 in this system was successfully prepared by growing Fe2O3 nanoparticles on the surface of g-C3N4. The Fe2O3 nanoparticles could achieve high dispersion on the surface of g-C3N4 and form a heterojunction with g-C3N4 to improve the charge separation. In addition, the combination of the Fentonu0027s reagent Fe2O3/H2O2 and the photocatalyst g-C3N4 greatly enhances the rate of the Fentonu0027s reaction with the assistance of the photocatalytic process. The results showed that the Fe2O3/g-C3N4 catalyst had a superior catalytic activity as compared with the single component of Fe2O3 or g-C3N4 and the mechanical mixture of Fe2O3 and g-C3N4. The catalyst prepared with 3 mL of FeCl3 aqueous solution shows the best photo-Fenton photocatalytic efficiency with a reaction rate constant of 0.02461 mg\u2009L\u20131\u2009min\u20131, which is about 45.4, 8.4 and 7.2 times larger than that of pure Fe2O3 (0.0005418 mg\u2009L\u20131\u2009min\u20131), pure g-C3N4 (0.00294 mg\u2009L\u20131\u2009min\u20131) and the mechanically mixed Fe2O3/g-C3N4 (0.0034 mg\u2009L\u20131\u2009min\u20131), respectively. A possible mechanism for the visible-light-irradiated photo-Fenton photocatalysis is proposed, and the Fe2O3/g-C3N4 catalyst exhibited stable performance without obvious loss of catalytic activity after four successive runs, showing a good application prospect for the photo-oxidative degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater.",

        "abstract": "A sensitive and selective SERS sensor with easy and excellent recyclability is highly demanded because of its great potential application in complex detection environments. Here, using methylene blue (MB) as a model target, a semiconductor-based SERS substrate composed of a MoO3 nanorod core and a uniform molecule-imprinting polymethacrylic acid shell (MIP) with a thickness of 4\u00a0nm was designed and fabricated (MoO3@MIP) to achieve selective detection. The key to the successful coating of the ultrathin uniform MIP shell lies in the pretreatment of a MoO3 core with nitric acid, providing sufficient surficial hydroxyls for the anchoring of a polymer precursor. The molecule-imprinted voids for MB were formed simply via light irradiation as a result of photocatalytic degradation by a MoO3 semiconductor. This core\u2013shell MIP composite shows a high SERS selectivity towards low-level MB in a mixed MB/CV solution. The enhanced factor (EF) is high, at 1.6 \u00d7 104. More importantly, the selective detection allows the further photocatalytic recycling of MoO3@MIP in an \u201caim-and-shoot\u201d way, which well preserves the detection selectivity and sensitivity towards MB at least for 4 cycles. Based on decreased sensitivity with the increasing shell thickness (10\u201324 nm), a MIP-gating charge transfer mechanism is proposed to demonstrate the high EF instead of the molecule-enrichment effect. This \u201caim-and-shoot\u201d strategy is expected to push forward the prosperous application of selective SERS for trace detection in versatile environments.",

        "abstract": "Spurred by the threat of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), the idea of reducing Cr(VI) into less toxic Cr(III) has been commonly studied. Here, we used a facile photodeposition method to modify inverse opal TiO2 (i.o.TiO2) with cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi), and the resulting composite was applied for photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). This is the first time that an inverse opal structure as well as a Co-Pi catalyst is applied in the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). In addition, the combination of i.o.TiO2 and Co-Pi achieves high visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity, which is better than that of the pure Co-Pi catalyst and unmodified i.o.TiO2. Experimental results demonstrated that the Co-Pi in the composite could absorb a large amount of visible light and then inject electrons into the conduction band of i.o.TiO2 which subsequently participate in the reduction reaction of Cr(VI). Moreover, the inverse opal structure of the catalyst possesses the advantages of having a large surface area and efficient light harvesting ability, leading to the better catalytic activity of Co-Pi/i.o.TiO2 than Co-Pi/bulk TiO2 and Co-Pi/P25. Itu0027s also proved that this Co-Pi/i.o.TiO2 photocatalyst can efficiently remove organic pollutants together with Cr(VI). This study provides new insights into the design and fabrication of efficient photocatalysts for the removal of environmental pollutants under visible light.",

The obtained samples are characterized by various spectroscopy techniques and applied in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of phenol. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained SBA15\u2013CN is 2 times as high as that of pure g-C3N4 due to the high dispersion of g-C3N4 into SBA-15 channels. For CD-SBA15\u2013CN, the visible light driven photocatalytic activity is further increased, which is 4 times as high as that of pure g-C3N4. This promotion can be attributed to carbon dots with the ability to transfer photogenerated electrons as well as the compound catalyst having a bigger surface area and pore volume. When the weight ratio of CD-SBA15/g-C3N4 was 1\u2006:\u20066, the catalyst (1\u2006:\u20066 CD-SBA15\u2013CN) performed best. The 1\u2006:\u20066 CD-SBA15\u2013CN photocatalyst had enhanced visible absorption and the interaction between CDs and g-C3N4 can further promote the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, achieving the highest photocatalytic activity of CD-SBA15\u2013CN compared to SBA15\u2013CN and g-C3N4.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A series of carbon-doped titanium dioxide (C-TiO 2 ) nanocrystals were hydrothermally synthesized using Ti(SO 4 ) 2  and glucose as titania and carbon resources for 12\u201348\u00a0h. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction analyses demonstrate that these C-TiO 2  nanocrystals are well crystallized and exhibit better particle dispersity than non-doped TiO 2 . Compared with pure TiO 2 , all dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) assembled from C-TiO 2  nanocrystals exhibited improved short circuit current and open circuit voltage. A highest energy conversion efficiency (6.9%) was achieved on C-TiO 2  synthesized for 24\u00a0h, with a significant improvement of 35.3%. The enhancement was attributed to both the less charge recombination and the negative shifting of the flat band potential as demonstrated by dye-adsorption analysis, photoluminescence and electron lifetime measurements.",

The ratio of adding Bi and Ti precursors can be controlled during the preparation process. The phase structure is confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The UV\u2013visible diffuse reflectance spectrum shows that the composite catalysts present light absorption in the visible region. The obtained Bi2O2.7/Bi2Ti2O7 composite films possess superior photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B, owing to the visible light response of Bi2O2.7 and the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes between the two components. As a result, the Bi2O2.7/Bi2Ti2O7 (Bi/Ti = 1:1) displays the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light or UV light irradiation for the degradation of different organic dyes, including methyl blue, methyl orange and acid orange 7.",

The average sulfur particle size is around 8 nm, and we utilized various volumes of ammonium polysulfide ((NH4)2Sx) to tailor the loading of sulfur nanoparticles.

In this study, we develop a functional nanocomposite hydrogel with a highly photocatalytic Fenton reaction activity for the degradation of organic pollutants and adsorption for the heavy metal ions. The hydrogel is made up of Fe 3 O 4  nanoparticles, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and polyacrylamide (PAM), which is prepared by a two-step chemical synthetic method, and exhibits the outstanding mechanical strength, Photo-Fenton activity, adsorptive property and reversibility. For the degradation of organic dyes, the Fe 3 O 4 /RGO/PAM hydrogel can degrade the 20\u00a0mg/L Rhodamine B (RhB) for 90% within 60\u00a0min under visible light irradiation, and even after 10 times cycle test, the degradation rate for RhB still keeps at 90%. Meanwhile, it can degrade the actual sewage of fine chemical wastewater, whose COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) decreases from 10400 to 2840\u00a0mg/L after one hour\u2019s visible irradiation. For the synchronous removal of organic pollutants and heavy metal ions over hydrogel, the degradation data of 20\u00a0mg/L RhB can be up to 90% with 20\u00a0min under visible light irradiation, and the removal rate of various metal ions can reach up to 34.8%\u201366.3% after continual two days\u2019 adsorption.

        "abstract": "As a typical advanced oxidation technology, the Fenton reaction has been employed for the disinfection, owing to the strong oxidizability of hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH). However, the conventional Fenton system always exhibits a low HO decomposition efficiency, leading to a low production yield of \u00b7OH, which makes the disinfection effect unsatisfactory. Herein, we develop a molybdenum sulfide (MoS) co-catalytic Fenton reaction for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of Escherichia coli K-12 (E.\u00a0coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S.\u00a0aureus). As a co-catalyst in the Fe(II)/HO Fenton system, MoS can greatly facilitate the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle reaction by the exposed Mo active sites, which significantly improves the HO decomposition efficiency for the \u00b7OH production. As a result, the MoS co-catalytic Fenton system can reach up to 83.37% of inactivation rate of E.\u00a0coli just in 1\u202fmin and 100% of inactivation rate within 30\u202fmin, which increased by 2.5 times than that of the conventional Fenton reaction. Furthermore, the \u00b7OH as the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MoS co-catalytic Fenton reaction was measured and verified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and photoluminescence (PL). It is demonstrated an increased amount of \u00b7OH generated from the decomposition of HO in the presence of MoS, which is responsible for the rapid and efficient inactivation of E.\u00a0coli and S.\u00a0aureus. This study provides a new perspective for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of bacteria in environmental remediation.",

        "abstract": "The greatest problem in the Fe(II)/H2O2 Fenton reaction is the low production of \u2022OH owing to the inefficient Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle and the low decomposition efficiency of H2O2 (<30%). Herein, we report a new discovery regarding the significant cocatalytic effect of WS2 on the decomposition of H2O2 in a photoassisted Fe(II)/H2O2 Fenton system. With the help of WS2 cocatalytic effect, the H2O2 decomposition efficiency can be increased from 22.9% to 60.1%, so that minimal concentrations of H2O2 (0.4 mmol/L) and Fe2+ (0.14 mmol/L) are necessary for the standard Fenton reaction. Interestingly, the cocatalytic Fenton strategy can be applied to the simultaneous oxidation of phenol (10 mg/L) and reduction of Cr(VI) (40 mg/L), and the corresponding degradation and reduction rates can reach up to 80.9% and 90.9%, respectively, which are much higher than the conventional Fenton reaction (52.0% and 31.0%). We found that the expose reductive W4+ active sites on the surface of WS2 can greatly accelerate the rate-limiting step of Fe3+/Fe2+ conversion, which plays the key role in the decomposition of H2O2 and the reduction of Cr(VI). Our discovery represents a breakthrough in the field of inorganic catalyzing AOPs and greatly advances the practical utility of this method for environmental applications.",

In this study, we successfully prepared a PDPB/SnO2 p\u2013n heterojunction by an in situ growth route. The XPS characterization indicates the generation of Sn\u2013C bonds between SnO2 and PDPB, which would decrease the bandgap of SnO2 and promote the transference efficiency of electrons and holes between these two components. The PDPB could act as the sensitizer to enlarge the solar light absorption region of the heterojunction. The SnO2 provides a stable mesoporous structure and enhanced hydrophilic properties. The solar-driven photodegradation rate of Rhodamine B over the PDPB/SnO2 (ratio is 2\u2006:\u20061) is 4 times higher than that of the pure SnO2 and 2 times higher than that of the pure PDPB nanofibers.

        "abstract": "The preparation of reduced TiO2 photocatalysts with high Ti3+ concentration is a great challenge due to their instability in air. Here we report a new approach for the synthesis of reduced TiO2 with {001} facets exposed via a hydrothermal process. By the introduction of fluoride atoms, {001} and {101} facets are formed, which act as hole and electron collectors, respectively, for charge separation. By adjusting the volume of HF added, a rutile\u2013anatase transition is observed for the first time. EPR spectra confirm the generation of Ti3+ species in the bulk of TiO2, and Ti3+ signals are studied in the anatase and rutile phases separately. The quantified EPR shows that reduced TiO2 samples present 14\u2006000-fold more spins compared to the pristine TiO2, and the intensity can reach as high as 24.6 \u00d7 1019 spins per g. The obtained samples also have a unique disordered layer with a thickness of 1\u20132 nm on their surfaces, which contributes to the stabilization of the formed Ti3+ species by preventing their oxidation in air. In addition, the synthesized reduced TiO2 samples also exhibit wide-spectrum solar light absorption, especially in the near-infrared region. Owing to their enhanced solar light absorption, improved electron\u2013hole separation and special facet exposure, these samples exhibit enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance and high CH4 selectivity under solar light irradiation, in the absence of a noble metal Pt as a co-catalyst.",

        "abstract": "Managing air and water pollution is among the greatest challenges and a major issue for human civilizations in the 21st century. Semiconductors such as TiO2 are regarded as one of the most promising catalysts that can be used to realize the simultaneous and efficient treatment of multi-component wastewater and NO selective oxidation. However, the granular TiO2 always contains too many phase interfaces, which are harmful to the transfer of photo-excited electrons. Reduced TiO2 mesoporous single crystals (TiO2\u2212x MSCs) with capacity of photoreduction and photooxidation were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal treatment. The formation of Ti3+ impurity levels contribute to a narrowed band gap and enhanced visible light adsorption of TiO2\u2212x. In addition, the mesoporous single crystal structure would provide a long-range order channel for the transfer of photo-generated electrons, which leads to the efficient photoreduction and photooxidation capacity of TiO2\u2212x MSCs. The results revealed that Ti3+-MSCs exhibit outstanding photocatalytic decontamination performance in simultaneous photo-degradation of phenol and removal of Cr(VI) owing to high photo-generated charge separation rate and the synergistic effect of phenol and Cr(VI). In addition, in the absence of any noble metal, the as-prepared reduced Ti3+-MSCs still show high selectivity of NO2 in the NOx photo-oxidation process, owing to the extended wide-spectrum absorption of Ti3+-MSCs and the high-active holes on Ti3+-MSCs under solar light irradiation.",

Further modification of TiO2 nanocrystals on the chiral CNTs successfully realized the recycling of SERS substrate as chiral CNT/TiO2 hybrids. The high SERS sensitivity of methylene blue (MB) over the chiral CNT/TiO2 hybrids is ascribed to the laser-driven birefringence induced by the helical structure, which provides much more opportunities for the occurrence of Raman scattering. The TiO2 nanocrystals highly dispersed on the surface and inside the hollow cavity of chiral CNTs can completely degrade the MB under the solar light irradiation, leading to the self-cleaning of SERS substrate. The present research opens a new way for the application of chiral inorganic materials in plasmon-free SERS detection. ",

Controlled design of hollow cobalt sulfide (Co S ) cubes embedded with cadmium sulfide quantum dots (QDs) is described, using hollow Co(OH) as the template and a one-pot hydrothermal strategy. The hollow CdS/Co S cubes utilize multiple reflections of light in the cubic structure to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity. Importantly, the photoexcited charge carriers can be effectively separated by the construction of a redox-mediator-free Z-scheme system. The hydrogen evolution rate over hollow CdS/Co S is 134 and 9.1 times higher than that of pure hollow Co S and CdS QDs under simulated solar light irradiation, respectively. Moreover, this is the first report describing construction of a hollow Co S based Z-scheme system for photocatalytic water splitting, which gives full play to the advantages of light-harvesting and charges separation.",

Various characterization techniques were adopted to examine the structures and physicochemical properties of the as-prepared mpg-C3N4 samples. The results are a step forward to the bottleneck problems of producing mesoporous g-C3N4 materials with both a high BET surface area with well-adorned pore diameters and considerable pore volume by simply employing ammonium chloride as a gaseous bubble template and melamine as a g-C3N4 precursor. The obtained ammonium chloride-mediated mesoporous g-C3N4 photocatalyst demonstrated excellent photocatalytic performance compared with bulk g-C3N4 for the visible light photodegradation of RhB and phenol. The extraordinary photocatalytic activity and outstanding stability of the as-prepared mesoporous g-C3N4 were predominantly attributed to the exceptionally high surface area with ordered pore diameters, improved optical absorbance, and efficient charge separation. Our work not only exhibits the simplest, eco-friendly, and economical approach to fabricate highly efficient well-adorned mesoporous g-C3N4 photocatalysts, but also paves new opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of advanced photocatalysts with great potential in environmental remediation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The construction of catalysts with high efficiency and stability for heterogeneous Photo-Fenton reaction Heterogeneous (PFR) has been a major challenge for the degradation of organic pollutants. Here, we successfully develop an advanced TiO 2 /Fe 2 TiO 5 /Fe 2 O 3  triple-heterojunction structure by using the mesoporous TiO 2  spheres as the substrate via a simple ion-exchange method. The XRD and HRTEM results demonstrate the generation of Fe 2 TiO 5  on the interface between TiO 2  and Fe 2 O 3 , which can be used as a \u201cbridge\u201d to transfer the photo-excited electrons from TiO 2  to Fe 2 O 3 . The as-prepared triple-heterojunction has abundant interphase boundaries which greatly improve the migration of photo-excited charges among different components. As a result, the prepared triple-heterojunction has a significantly enhanced PFR activity for the visible-light-driven degradation of methyl orange (MO) and colorless organic pollutant of phenol, compared with the single catalysts of Fe 2 O 3  and TiO 2 , and the binary-heterojunction of TiO 2 /Fe 2 O 3 . Compared to the traditional Fe 2 O 3  based PFR, the degradation rates of MO and phenol over triple-heterojunction can be increased from 4% to 87% within 10\u00a0min irradiation and from 38% to 100% within 60\u00a0min irradiation, respectively. And the total organic carbon (TOC) degradation rate of phenol can be up to 85%. Moreover, this advanced triple-heterojunction has a wide pH value range of application in PFR. Either at a pH of 4.0 or 7.0, it shows a much higher and more stable PFR activity for the degradation of MO than the catalysts of Fe 2 O 3  and TiO 2 /Fe 2 O 3 . And the reaction rate of TiO 2 /Fe 2 TiO 5 /Fe 2 O 3  almost keeps changeless even after 10th cycles, suggesting its vast application foreground in the environmental pollutant treatment.",

        "title": "Modifications on reduced titanium dioxide photocatalysts: A review",
        "abstract": "Abstract   A large variety of reduced titanium dioxide (TiO 2-x ) materials have been reported recently. Reduced TiO 2 , usually resulting from the removal of oxygen atoms or hydrogen incorporation, is proved to be efficient for achieving highly photocatalytic performance including photodegradation of organic compounds, hydrogen generation from water splitting, CO 2  reduction for CH 4  evolution, solar cells,  etc . To further improve the properties and activities of TiO 2-x , a combination of the Ti 3+  self-doping and other traditional modifications like nonmetals doping has been proposed in the past decades. This paper provides a general and critical review on the further modifications on reduced TiO 2  samples, including non-metal elements (N, B, S, F and I) doping, noble-metal (Au, Pt, Pd and Ag) and iron-group metal (Fe, Co and Ni) grafting, metal oxide compositing, carbon (nanotubes and graphene) and carbon-based-material compositing, special facets exposure (mainly dual {001}-{101} and {111}-{110} facets) of TiO 2-x  and ordered structure controlling of TiO 2-x . These modifications enhance the physical and/or chemical properties of the reduced TiO 2 , or create new features for the modified TiO 2-x  samples, which finally leads to the enhancement of photocatalytic performance. Key examples such as N-doping, Au grafting and graphene-based compositing are discussed carefully, and the mechanisms for solar light enhancement, electron transfer and charge separation are also investigated. Finally, some challenging issues on TiO 2-x  catalysts are also proposed to encourage new approaches for preparation of TiO 2-x  catalysts with efficiently photocatalytic performance.",

        "abstract": "To the photocatalytic H2 evolution, the exposure of a reduction surface over a catalyst plays an important role for the reduction of hydrogen protons. Here, this study demonstrates the design of a noble-metal-free spatially separated photocatalytic system exposed with reduction surfaces (MnOx@CdS/CoP) for highly solar-light-driven H2 evolution activity. CoP and MnOx nanoparticles are employed as the electron and hole collectors, which are selectively anchored on the outer and inner surface of CdS shells, respectively. Under solar light irradiation, the photogenerated holes and electrons can directionally move to the MnOx and CoP, respectively, leading to the exposure of a reduction surface. As a result, the H2 evolution increases from 32.0 to 238.4 \u00b5mol h\u22121, which is even higher than the activity of platinum-loaded photocatalyst (MnOx@CdS/Pt). Compared to the pure CdS with serious photocorrosion, the MnOx@CdS/CoP maintains a changeless activity for the H2 evolution and rhodamine B degradation, even after four cycles. The research provides a new strategy for the preparation of spatially separated photocatalysts with a selective reduction surface.",

The obtained reduced TiO2 presents a wide-spectrum solar light absorption, including the near-infrared region. In addition, {110}\u2013{111} and {101}\u2013(001) dual-facet exposures are generated by Cl- and F-based surface-terminated reagents, respectively. The generated {001} and {101} facets on reduced TiO2 samples act as hole and electron collectors, respectively, which contributes to the charge separation of the catalyst.

However, the preparation of such g-C 3 N 4  material remains a challenge by a simple and economic thermal-treatment in a furnace. Herein, we report a novel and effective strategy for high-yield synthesis of extremely active crystalline carbon nitride nanosheets (CCNNSs) by two-step calcination without the assistance of any additive or salt intercalation. As expected, the as-prepared CCNNSs exhibit a remarkably high hydrogen evolution rate of 9577.6\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fh \u22121 \u202fg \u22121  under simulated solar light irradiation, which is 15.5 times than that of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , as well as higher than most of the reported crystalline g-C 3 N 4 . Moreover, a highly apparent quantum efficiency of 9.01% at 420\u202fnm for hydrogen evolution can be achieved, which is also superior to the reported crystalline g-C 3 N 4 . Such two-step calcination approach not only provides an economical way to effectively regulate the crystallinity of bulk g-C 3 N 4 , but also achieves the preparation of CCNNSs with high yield. Our research opens up a new window to self-modification and fabrication of highly active metal-free photocatalysts for solar light-driven hydrogen production.",

Furthermore, NH 4 F is easier to afford as compared to traditional organic fluorine reagents. As expected, F-TiO 2 /MCF demonstrates high photocatalytic activity and stability on pollutant degradation and hydrogen evolution. Under solar light irradiation, the degradation rate of methyl orange (MO) can be up to 93% within 7\u202fmin. The outstanding photocatalytic performance of F-TiO 2 /MCF is ascribed to abundant F atoms filling into oxygen vacancies in TiO 2  and high specific surface area.

Here, we report that metal sulfides (MoS 2 , WS 2 , Cr 2 S 3 , CoS 2 , PbS, or ZnS) can serve as excellent co-catalysts to greatly increase the efficiency of H 2 O 2  decomposition and significantly decrease the required dosage of H 2 O 2  and Fe 2+  in AOPs. Unsaturated S atoms on the surface of metal sulfides can capture protons to form H 2 S and expose metallic active sites with reductive properties to accelerate the rate-limiting step of Fe 3+ /Fe 2+  conversion. The efficiency of AOPs involving co-catalysts can be further enhanced by visible-light illumination thanks to the sensitization of organic pollutants. This discovery is expected to drive great advances in the\u00a0use of AOPs for large-scale practical applications such as environmental remediation.",

However, noble-metal-based promoters are limited by their expensive costs and scarcities. Recently, massive efforts have been focused on metal phosphides, metal sulfides, and metal carbides as cocatalysts to achieve high HER performance. Currently, metal borides were reported as promoters for hydrogen evolution. Here, we demonstrate amorphous nickel boride (NiB) with a suitable band gap prepared by the chemical reduction of nickel nitrate hexahydrate using sodium borohydride as a cocatalyst over graphite carbon nitride (C3N4), thus achieving higher hydrogen evolution performance than C3N4. With the B(\u03b4\u2212)\u2013Ni(\u03b4+)\u2013N(\u03b4\u2212) bonds between NiB and C3N4, the as-prepared C3N4/NiB7.5 shows a dramatically enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate (464.4 \u03bcmol h\u20131 g\u20131), and reaches a quantum efficiency of 10.92% with 365 nm light irradiation.",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries owing to their high theoretical capacity and stable cyclability. Moreover, by increasing the content of P in TMPs, their lithium storage performance can be further improved. However, the decreased electrical conductivity caused by continuous increment of the P doping into metal and the large volume change during the lithiation/delithiation process limit the electrical energy storage applications of such materials. The combination of the advantages of graphene and a hollow structure is regarded as an approach to solve these issues. In this work, CoP nanocages wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (CoP@RGO) were fabricated via a template-based method followed by a low-temperature phosphating process. Such a unique structure can not only accommodate the volume change during the lithiation/delithiation process but also improve the electric conductivity of the CoP nanocages. The obtained CoP@RGO nanocages exhibited remarkable stable capacity of 546.6\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121 at current density of 100\u00a0mA\u00a0g\u22121 over 500 cycles (or 460.4\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121 at current density of 500\u00a0mA\u00a0g\u22121 over 500 cycles).",

Here, the synergistic photocatalytic remediation of hexavalent chromium and phenol under visible light was studied with the purpose of both environmental remediation and sustainable development in mind. Using a structural engineering strategy, the typical CdS-based heterojunction with outer nanocrystal cluster protection is unprecedentedly endowed with the efficient and recyclable capability of a visible-light-driven photocatalysis for the remediation of pollutants in strong acidic conditions. Owing to the structure-enabled acidic stability, the simultaneous remediation of Cr(VI) and phenol can be undertaken in an efficient and recyclable mode at pH\u2009=\u20092.0\u20137.0. This study fundamentally evolves a representative photocatalytic system into one with more industrial and practical applications foracid drainage purification.",

Such a capability is vitally crucial in order to design sophisticated and multi-functional catalysts with tailorable properties. This comprehensive review describes some important recent advances with respect to 3DGMs, including their preparation methods, characterization and applications in catalysis, e.g., photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, organic catalysis, and CO oxidation. The importance of the relationship between the structure and catalytic performance, a topic which has become a central focus of research in order to develop high-performance catalytic systems, is discussed.

After the hydrophobic modification, the CO2 photoreduction for the selective generation of CH4 over the noble-metal-free TiO2-SiO2 composite can be greatly enhanced (2.42 vs 0.10 \u03bcmol/g in 4h). The enhanced CO2 photoreduction efficiency is assigned to the rational hydrophobic modification on TiO2-SiO2 surface by replacing Si-OH to hydrophobic Si-F bonds, which will improve the CO2 competitive adsorption and trigger the eight-electron CO2 photoreduction on the reaction kinetics.

        "abstract": "The preparation of reduced TiO photocatalysts with high Ti concentration is a great challenge due to their instability in air. Here we report a new approach for the synthesis of reduced TiO with {001} facets exposed via a hydrothermal process. By the introduction of fluoride atoms, {001} and {101} facets are formed, which act as hole and electron collectors, respectively, for charge separation. By adjusting the volume of HF added, a rutile-anatase transition is observed for the first time. EPR spectra confirm the generation of Ti species in the bulk of TiO, and Ti signals are studied in the anatase and rutile phases separately. The quantified EPR shows that reduced TiO samples present 14\u2009000-fold more spins compared to the pristine TiO, and the intensity can reach as high as 24.6 \u00d7 10 spins per g. The obtained samples also have a unique disordered layer with a thickness of 1-2 nm on their surfaces, which contributes to the stabilization of the formed Ti species by preventing their oxidation in air. In addition, the synthesized reduced TiO samples also exhibit wide-spectrum solar light absorption, especially in the near-infrared region. Owing to their enhanced solar light absorption, improved electron-hole separation and special facet exposure, these samples exhibit enhanced photocatalytic CO reduction performance and high CH selectivity under solar light irradiation, in the absence of a noble metal Pt as a co-catalyst.",

Characterizations by HR-TEM, EDS-Mapping, XRD, XPS confirmed the existence and spatial separated locations of Au and RuO2. In CO2 photocatalytic reduction (CO2PR), the Au/HRTSO (0.8%) shows the optimal performance in both the activity and selectivity towards CH4, which the CH4 yield is almost two times than the singular Au/HTSO or HRTSO (0.8%) counterpart.

As for these 2DGMs, there is a complementary need to assemble 2D building blocks hierarchically into more complicated and hierarchical three-dimensional graphene-based materials (3DGMs). Such a capability is vitally crucial in order to design sophisticated and multi-functional catalysts with tailorable properties. This comprehensive review describes some important recent advances with respect to 3DGMs, including their preparation methods, characterization and applications in catalysis, e.g., photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, organic catalysis, and CO oxidation. The importance of the relationship between the structure and catalytic performance, a topic which has become a central focus of research in order to develop high-performance catalytic systems, is discussed. Likely future developments and their associated challenges are proposed and discussed.",

Nevertheless, an in-depth understanding of the platinum's size effect in the carbon dioxide photocatalytic reduction is still lacking. Through analyses of the geometric features and electronic properties with variable-sized Pt NPs, here we show a prominent size effect of Pt NPs in both the activity and selectivity of carbon dioxide photocatalytic reduction. Decreasing the size of Pt NPs promotes the charge transfer efficiency, and thus enhances both the carbon dioxide photocatalytic reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, but leads to higher selectivity towards hydrogen over methane. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations, in Pt NPs, the terrace sites are revealed as the active sites for methane generation; meanwhile, the low-coordinated sites are more favorable in the competing HER.",

        "abstract": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 holds great promises for addressing both the environmental and energy issues that are facing the modern society. The major challenge of CO2 photoreduction into fuels such as methane or methanol is the low yield and poor selectivity. Here, we report an effective strategy to enhance the reduction potential of photo-excited electrons by fluorination of mesoporous single crystals (MSCs) of reduced TiO2-x. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and photoelectricity tests indicate that the Ti3+ impurity level is upswept by fluorination, owing to the built-in electric field constructed by the substitutional F that replaces surface oxygen vacancies, which leads to the enhanced reduction potential of photo-excited electrons. As a result, the fluorination of the reduced TiO2-x dramatically increases the CH4 production yield by 13 times from 0.125 \u00b5mol/g\u00b7h to 1.63 \u00b5mol/g\u00b7h under solar light illumination, with the CH4 selectivity being improved from 25.7% to 85.8%. Our finding provides a metal-free strategy for the selective CH4 generation from CO2 photoreduction.",

The resulting TiO2 nanorods were about 200 nm in length with exposed (100) and (010) facets. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Raman, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The XRD results suggest that the prepared samples have an anatase crystalline structure. All of the composites tested exhibited improved photocatalytic activities as measured by the degradation of methylene blue and phenol under visible light irradiation. This improvement was attributed to the synergistic effect of Ti(3+) self-doping on TiO2 nanorods and boron doping on graphene.",

        "abstract": "Nanostructured titania and titanate have been considered as very important materials used in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, gas sensing and other electronic industries. In principle, their common structural feature is that the precursor phase involving TiO6 octahedra or similar building units may be converted to any of the nanostructured titania and titanate forms in a controllable way. Based on the atomic arrangement of ionic liquid-mediated NH4TiOF3 mesocrystals, TiO2 nanocrystals and titanate nanotubes were selectively obtained in H3BO3 and NaOH media, respectively, by using a simple hydrothermal method. Interestingly, the titanate nanotubes were successfully formed by extraction of NH4(+) and F from NH4TiOF3 in a milder alkaline environment as low as 1 M NaOH, rather than conventional treatment of TiO2 in 10 M NaOH. The as-prepared TiO2 nanocrystals with exposed {001} facets exhibit a high photocatalytic activity and sedimentation rate as compared to commercial TiO2. Upon further doping or ion-exchange, the newly prepared TiO2 nanocrystals will show potential applications in the environment. ",

The prepared co-doped photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, UV\u2013Vis absorption spectra, EPR, and XPS. It was found that the co-doped TiO has dispersed nanoparticles and a narrower band-gap compared with the un-doped TiO and single-doped TiO. The experimental results displayed that the coke carbon generated on the surface of co-doped TiO acts as a photosensitizer and has the photosensitization effect under solar light irradiation. Except for the carbon sensitization effect, the Ti self-doping modification has a synergistic effect which is the reason for the effective photo-degradation of methyl orange under simulated solar light irradiation.",

        "abstract": "In this research, adsorption and photocatalytic degradation process were utilized to remove organic dye from wastewater. To accomplish that, a newly-designed ternary nanostructure based on Ag nanoparticles/ZnO nanorods/three-dimensional graphene network (Ag NPs/ZnO NRs/3DG) was prepared using a combined hydrothermal-photodeposition method. The three-dimensional structure of graphene hydrogel as a support for growth of ZnO nanorods was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). In addition, diameter of silver nanoparticles grown on the ZnO nanorods with the average aspect ratio of 5 was determined in the range of 30-80\u202fnm by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was revealed hexagonal Wurtzite structure of ZnO nanorods and the (1\u202f1\u202f1) lattice plane of the face-centered cubic (FCC) of the silver nanoparticles. The dye adsorption capacity of the synthesized 3DG was evaluated at about 300\u202fmg/g using kinetic study. The photocatalytic dye degradation under both UV and visible light irradiation exhibited an enhanced activity of the prepared ternary Ag/ZnO/3DG sample in comparison to ZnO/3DG and 3DG structures. Different charge-carrier scavengers were utilized to elucidate the synergistic effect of adsorption and visible-light photocatalytic degradation mechanism for dye removal. The facile photocatalyst recovery as well as the high elimination rate of dye is promising for future applications such as efficient removal of organic contaminants from industrial wastewater under solar irradiation.",

The complete mode coupling can take place when both the phase and loss matching conditions are satisfied at the avoided anti-crossing wavelength. It shows the influences of cladding structure parameters including the diameters of cladding air holes d1, diameters of outer core holes d2 and hole to hole pitch \u039b on the characteristics of leaky modes coupling. The coupled-mode theory is used to analyse the mode transition characteristics and the complete coupling can be clearly indicated by comparing the real and imaginary parts of propagation constant of the leaky modes. \u00a9 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Based on the simulation model with interstitial holes, the influence of glass interstitial apexes on photonic band-gaps is discussed. The existing forms of guided-mode in part band gaps are shown by using the full-vector plane-wave method. In the experiment, the observed transmission spectrum corresponds to the part band gaps obtained by simulation. The fundamental and second-order guided-modes with mixture of yellow and green light are observed through choosing appropriate fibre length and adjusting coupling device.

When the fundamental mode experiences an anomalous dispersion regime, three phases in the SC generation process are primarily presented. The SC generation (SCG) in the wavelength range from 470 nm to 805 nm does not emerge significant ripples due to a higher pump peak power and the corresponding mode fields at different wavelengths are observed using Bragg gratings. The relative intensity fluctuations of output spectrum in the wavelength ranges of 530 nm to 640 nm and 543 nm to 590 nm are only 0.028 and 0.0071, respectively. \u00a9 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Results indicate that the average amplitude difference of these two polarization pulses becomes larger with \u03b4 increasing, and soliton self-trapping becomes worse. When 3rd-order dispersion increases, soliton self-trapping becomes worse too.

The phase-conjugation is achieved by four-wave mixing in an optimized semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA), which solves the dispersion problem of the FSK/IM orthogonal signal. We use the DFB laser as the optical source, and take the Corning's standard single-mode fiber as transmission link, and adopt the SOA with 500 \u03bcm length, and 0.15 optical confinement factor to realize spectral inversion. In the experiment, the central wavelength of orthogonal FSK/IM signal is fixed. We get the eye diagrams of the packet (label) in the IM (FSK) receiver. The results prove that the system has a good performance.",

The mathematic model of the angular displacement measurement was established and computer simulation was carried out. The effect of various parameters on moir\u00e9 signals was studied theoretically and experimentally, and the results are consistent. A precision angular displacement measurement and control apparatus based on moir\u00e9 signals was designed. The device achieves precision angular displacement measurement and automatic angular alignment using computer controlled moir\u00e9 technique. The modified moir\u00e9 technique effectively improves the detecting sensitivity of the signals and simplifies the control system using only one pair of laser-moir\u00e9 sensors. The experimental result shows that the proposed apparatus achieves the resolution of \u00b1 50 nrad and angular positioning accuracy of \u00b1 5 \u03bcrad.",

When directional transmittance is measured at large angle of incidence (AOI), a polarizer has to be used to produce linearly polarized light and it also becomes an error source. This study presents a method for accurate measurement of wideband transmittance at large AOI, which is aimed to eliminate the polarization error in measured transmittance at oblique incidence. Using this method, we can measure the directional transmittance with a good precision if a partially polarized incident beam is provided. This method reduces the requirement for the performance of the polarizer, and will find application in the highly integrated spectrophotometers.",

The deposition parameters were optimized to control the film stress and wavefront distortion, and to reduce the film absorption, to decrease the defect density. The LIDT of the prepared films was also measured. The experimental results show that adjusting the pressure during SiO 2 evaporation can control the film stress within the range of -250 to -50 MPa. Using hafnium and silica as starting materials can reduce the defect density from 12.6 to 2.7 mm -2 and increase the LIDT from 30 to 55 J/cm 2.",

However, the half-wave hole effect, caused mainly by the refractive index inhomogeneity of hafnia, affects the spectra and application of these mirrors. Two approaches to eliminate the half-wave hole effect have been proposed. Both approaches attempt to shift the location of the half-wave hole in comparison with the original wavelength. One approach broadens the reflectance band of the first harmonic wavelength and simultaneously adjusts the central reflectance band to a longer wavelength, whereas the other approach combines the two stacks to adjust the location of the half-wave hole far away from the wavelength of interest. Two kinds of dichroic mirrors have been successfully fabricated; moreover, it was found that the method of a two-stack combination, 0.9(HL)8 and 1.1(HL)8, provides designs that can be fabricated more easily and with better quality spectral characteristics.",

Here, a simplified model is proposed to describe the intensified EFI in nodules: 1) the nodule works as a microlens and its focal length can be predicted using a simple formula, 2) the portion of incident light that penetrates through the HR coating can be estimated by knowing the angular dependent transmittance (ADT) of the nodule, 3) strong EFI enhancement is created when the focal point is within the nodule and simultaneously a certain portion of light penetrates to the focal position. In the light of the proposed model, a broadband HR coating was used to reduce the EFI enhancement at the seed by a factor about 10, which leads to a 20 times increment of the LIDT. This work therefore not only deepens the physical understanding of EFI enhancement at nodules but also provides a new way to increase the LIDT of multilayer reflective optics.",

The polarization bandwidth can be broader than traditional TFPs by roughly a factor of 2. We designed and fabricated two HfO(2)/SiO(2) Brewster's angle TFPs with a high contrast ratio in the spectral range of 1064\u00b125 nm. The laser-induced damage was investigated and illustrates that the two designs possess quite different laser damage properties due to the different electric field distributions. Nevertheless, broadband TFPs with high laser-induced damage threshold can be achieved with proper coating design.",

Preproduction error analysis and computational manufacturing are used to estimate potential advantages of application of indirect optical monitoring. It is then demonstrated that a key issue for realization of this advantage is accurate specification of tooling factors for layer thicknesses on test glasses. The tooling factors are precalibrated using single layer depositions and then are corrected using results of reverse engineering for the first production run. It is found that a gradual variation of tooling factors of low index layers is the main error factor in the first deposition run. Finally, we redeposit our coating with a modified monitoring strategy, taking into account this factor.

The depths of flat bottom pits were examined by an optical profiler and then calibrated according to the Electric-Field Intensity (EFI) distributions and the cross-sectional micrographs obtained using the Focus Ion Beam (FIB) technology. The statistics for depths of 60 damage sites suggested that the Ta(2)O(5) over SiO(2) interface was more vulnerable to Laser-Induced Damage (LID) than the SiO(2) over Ta(2)O(5) interface. After examining the morphologies of interfacial delaminations carefully, we found that the Ta(2)O(5) over SiO(2) interface instead had stronger mechanical strength. So, the higher density of susceptible defects at the Ta(2)O(5) over SiO(2) interface was considered to be the reason that LID was preferentially initiated at this type of interface. Based on the above findings, a phenomenological model was proposed to describe the formation of flat bottom pits.",

A direct link between the cross-sectional |E|2 distributions and damage morphologies of nodules was found, which can perfectly explain the observed dependence of LIDTs on seed absorptivity. Another series of asymmetrical nodules were also studied in this work. The measured LIDTs of asymmetrical nodules were about 40%-70% lower than the LIDTs of the symmetrical nodules initiating from the same-sized SiO2 seeds. The weaker mechanical stability and the nonuniform |E|2 distributions are two main reasons for the lower laser damage resistance of the asymmetrical nodules.",

        "abstract": "Thermomechanical damage of nodules in dielectric multilayer coatings that are irradiated by nanosecond laser pulses has been interpreted with respect to mechanical properties and electric-field enhancement. However, the effect of electric-field enhancement in nodular damage, especially the influence of electric-field distributions, has never been directly demonstrated through experimental results, which prevents the achievement of a clear understanding of the damage process of nodular defects. Here, a systematic and comparative study was designed to reveal how electric-field distributions affect the damage behavior of nodules. To obtain reliable results, two series of artificial nodules with different geometries and film absorption characteristics were prepared from monodisperse silica microspheres. After establishing simplified geometrical models of the nodules, the electric-field enhancement was simulated using a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain code. Then, the damage morphologies of the artificial nodules were directly compared with the simulated electric-field intensity profiles. For both series of nodules, the damage morphologies reproduced our simulated electric-field intensity distributions very well. These results indicated that the electric-field distribution was actually a bridge that connected the nodular mechanical properties to the final thermomechanical damage. Understanding of the damage mechanism of nodules was deepened by obtaining data on the influence of electric-field distributions on the damage behavior of nodules. \u00a9 2013 CIOMP.

        "abstract": "By creating nodules from artificial seeds, the damage behaviors of engineered nodules were systematically studied from experimental approaches. The seed diameters, seed absorption and film absorption were varied independently to uncover a single factor's influence on the damage behavior of nodules. First, non-absorbing monodisperse SiO 2 microspheres with five different sizes were used to create engineered nodules in 1.053 \u03bcm HfO 2/SiO 2 high reflectors that were prepared by EB process. Laser damage test results showed that the ejection fluences of nodules monotonically decreased with the increase of silica microsphere diameters. And to our surprise, nodules initiating from 0.3 and 0.6 \u03bcm silica seeds survived the maximum fluence of 170 J/cm 2 (10 ns). Film absorption also has big influence on the damage behaviors of nodules. Compared to the nodules in low absorbing reflectors that were prepared by EB process, the nodules in high absorbing reflectors that were prepared by IAD process exhibited a much lower ejection fluences, although the seed diameters for the comprising nodules were same. Moreover, aluminum seeds were also used to create engineered nodules. Laser damage test results showed that the ejection fluences of nodules initiating from aluminum seeds were around 2 J/cm 2 (10 ns), which is more than an order of magnitude less than the ejection fluences of nodules created from nonabsorbing silica seeds. This result revealed that the seed absorption played a very important role in the laser damage of nodules. \u00a9 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",

Based on the fact that electric field distributions in single layers are different when the films are illuminated from the coating side and substrate side, an equation is given to calculate volume and interface absorptions of single layers. Half wave HfO2 and SiO2 single layers are prepared by electron beam evaporation method. With the absorption data measured by thermal lens technique, we separate the volume absoption from the interface absorption for these two single layers. The results show that interface absorption is non negligible when the absorption of film approaches to a ppm level. Additionally, the HfO2 single layer shows bigger volume and interface absorptions than SiO2 single layer. \u00a9 2011 Chinese Physical Society.",

        "abstract": "Nodules have been proved to play an important role in the activation of laser damage in 1.053 \u03bcm HfO2/SiO2 high reflectors. However, some damage test results revealed that the ejection fluences of some big nodules with height around 1 \u03bcm were abnormally high. To find the correlation between the surface dimensions of nodules and their susceptibility to nano-second pulsed laser radiation, monodisperse SiO2 microspheres with five different sizes were used to create engineered nodules in 1.053 \u03bcm HfO2/SiO2 high reflectors. The defect density of nodules that were created from SiO2 microspheres was purposely controlled to be around 20-40 mm2 and special care was taken to minimize clusters of SiO2 microspheres as less as possible. This enabled us to take a raster scan test and to get the statistical value of ejection fluences of these engineered nodules. The height and width dimensions of the engineered nodules, especially the discontinuity of nodular boundary, were measured by cross-sectioning of nodular defects using a focused ion-beam milling instrument. Based on the above information, the damage test results were interpreted from the aspects of electric field enhancement model and mechanical stability of nodular structures. \u00a9 2011 SPIE.",

The mirrors have high reflectance at 532 nm (S polarization) and high transmittance at 1064 nm (P polarization) for angle of incidence of 45\u00b0. Here we report the laser damage behaviors of the dichroic mirrors that were irradiated by 532 nm and 1064 nm nanosecond laser pulse separately. The influence of substrate polishing quality on the laser damage resistance of HfO2/SiO2 dichroic mirrors was also discussed. At 1064 nm, the nano-sized absorbers between coatings and substrate interface or subsurface are the precusors for creating damage. And the poor substrate polishing quality significantly decreases the laser induced damage threshold (LIDT). At 532 nm, two distinct damage behaviors initiating from visible nodules and nano-sized absorbers were observed. Nodules are ejected at low fluence but the ejected pits are very stable until quite high fluence around 20J/cm2 (1 ns). The nano-sized absorbers trigger damage at medium fluence around 14J/cm2 (1 ns), and this kind of damage grows very fast during subsequent irradiations. The substrate polishing quality has minor influence on the LIDT at 532 nm. \u00a9 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.",

The difference between the four testing methods was compared and analyzed. The results suggest that R-on-1 test obtains the highest LIDT, then comes the raster scan and 1-on-1, and the S-on-1 gives the lowest. The laser cumulative effect under 1000 pulses is not obvious, and the correlation between LIDT and spot size has not been observed when the difference of laser spot sizes is small. The influence of scanning interval and scanning fluence steps on laser conditioning effect was also discussed. Smaller interval produces better effect for the same spot size.",

Interference suppression was observed experimentally (633 nm wavelength, 45\u00b0 incidence angle, -35\u00b0 scattering angle) with a set of SiO-on-TaO bi-layers fabricated at different deposition angles. We detected a suppression of the scattering from the bi-layer fabricated at the deposition angle of 7.7\u00b0 by a factor of about 30 compared with that from the sample deposited at normal incidence.

        "abstract": "The influence of interface-continuity of nodules that initiate from 2 m SiO 2 particles on the damaging behaviors of HfO 2/SiO 2 high reflective coatings is discussed. Two kinds of films with different thickness are manufactured using ion-assistant deposition (IAD) technique. These films have similar distribution of electronic field and absorption; however, the film with larger thickness (double times) has better interface-continuity. The two kinds of films with engineered defects are irradiated by the 1064 nm (10 ns) laser pulse in the way of raster scan. It is found that the nodules in thicker films had higher initial damage threshold and the damage process is relatively slower. It is shown that for the SiO 2 particle with diameter of 2 m, the continuity of the interface between the nodular defects and surrounding layers become better with the increasing film's thickness, and its resistance to the laser-irradiation also increased.",

The laser damage test revealed that the ejection fluences and damage growth behaviors of nodules created from deep or shallow seeds were totally different.

        "abstract": "One TiO2/SiO2 high reflector with absorption of 300 ppm and two HfO2/SiO2 high reflectors with absorption of 40 and 4.5 ppm were fabricated using electron beam evaporation method. The influence of average absorption on laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) at 1064 nm of these coatings was studied using r-on-1 test mode. The LIDT of high absorbing TiO2/SiO2 coating is only 6.2 J/cm2 at 3 ns, whereas, two weak absorbing HfO2/SiO2 high reflectors got almost the same LIDT that was over 100 J/cm2 at 3 ns. Then a raster scan test method was employed to find the typical damage morphologies of these coatings with different absorption level. For TiO 2/SiO2 high reflector with high average absorption, the representative damage morphologies are shallow pits that were probably caused by absorbing centers. However, for HfO2/SiO2 high reflectors with low average absorption, the dominant damage morphologies are micrometer-sized nodules ejected pits and the delamination initiating from the pits. The absorption of HfO2/SiO2 coatings is low enough to have minor influence on the laser induced damage. \u00a9 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.",

Half-wave holes of the quarter wavelength symmetrical coatings usually caused by overall thickness mismatch and materials dispersion mismatch of the high and low refractive index films are simulated in order to conduct further research on their formation mechanism. Based on the theory of equivalent layers, the equivalent refractive index of a symmetrical design is calculated on Matlab platform. Consequently, the corresponding reflectance envelope is depicted. Through the study on the relation among the equivalent refractive index, reflectance spectrum and reflectance envelope of different designs, the characteristics of half-wave holes such as location, size and change tendency are analyzed in principle. Computational results indicate that thickness mismatch gives rise to equivalent refractive stop-band in the half wave of spectrum. The more the number of layers is, the more serious the thickness mismatch and dispersion mismatch are, the deeper the half-wave hole will be for a harmonic beam splitter.",

For the P-polarized configuration, only one high reflection (HR) coating on the rear surface of the Nd:Glass substrate is needed, and the laser-induced damage occurred near the substrate-coating interface at a fluence of 10 \u00b1 2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (1064nm 10ns). Although S-polarized configuration needs two coatings, one HR coating and one anti-reflection (AR) coating on the rear and front surface of the Nd:Glass substrate respectively, its overall LIDT was about 1.8 times higher than that of the P-polarized configuration. The laser-induced damage occurred at the interface between the S-polarized AR coating and the Nd:Glass substrate. The observed interfacial damage behaviors were interpreted using a phenomenological model that took the nano-sized absorbers, electric-field intensity (EFI) distribution and coating thickness into consideration.",

The influence of nodular boundary continuity on their nanosecond laser damage characteristics was investigated through experimental studies, combined with 3D finite-difference time domain simulations and photo-thermal micro-characterizations. Better boundary continuity led to improved mechanical stability and higher ejection fluence of nodules, in accordance with the thermomechanical damage model. In contrast, the ejected nodules that initially had better boundary continuity exhibited higher localized absorption and lower damage growth fluence, which is attributed to the creation of mechanically induced electronic defects or stronger electric field intensity enhancement at the ejected nodules.",

Three methods, x ray diffractometry, atomic force microscopy, and the k-correlated power spectral density function model, were used to obtain the grain sizes in two HfO<sub>2</sub> single layers with 16 and 20 nm thicknesses. X ray diffractometry showed that the grain sizes were about 7 and 9 nm, respectively, whereas the other two methods demonstrated that the grain sizes were about 14 and 16 nm. It was thought that x ray diffractometry underestimated the grain size due to micro strain or a shallow penetration depth. The grains in an HfO<sub>2</sub> single layer lead to a rough surface, which had a significant bulge at the middle-high frequency range in a power spectral density function curve. The coating intrinsic roughness of the HfO<sub>2</sub> single layer was separated from the substrate roughness.",

To suppress the ASE effect in slab lasers, this paper proposes a metal/dielectric broadband absorbing coating between the laser gain medium and the metal heat sink to suppress ASE from zero to total internal reflection angle on the facet from inside the laser medium. Based on accurate characterization of Cr metal thin films, Cr/SiO<sub>2</sub> broadband absorbing films for 1064 nm YAG slab lasers are designed and fabricated to suppress ASE. The good agreement between experiment and design shows the reliability to suppress ASE in slab lasers.",

From the analysis of the stress and fracture toughness, it was found that the crack originated due to the high tensile stress in hafnium coating. Then we proposed the approaches of decreasing the deposition temperature and substituting the hafnium layers with alumina to improve the mechanical stability of AR coatings on LBO crystals, and cracks were effectively suppressed. The laser damage threshold of different coatings on LBO crystal was tested, and it illustrated that the alumina/silica coatings possess better laser resistance than hafnium/silica AR coatings deposited in low deposition temperature.",

We carried out statistical analysis in angle, number, and crack length. We further analyzed the relationship between cracks and stress intensity or laser irradiation energy as well as the crack evolution process and the inner link between cracks and pit growth. We used an artificial indentation defect to investigate the time-domain evolution of crack growth, growth speed, transient morphology, and the characteristics of crater expansion.

        "abstract": "The influence of coating thickness on laser-induced damage (LID) characteristics of anti-reflection (AR) coatings irradiated by 1064 nm nanosecond laser pulses was investigated. Two HfO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> AR coatings with different physical thicknesses, 0.7 and 2.7 \u03bcm, were prepared and tested. To study the effect of coating thickness on a laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) in isolation, electric field intensities (EFIs) at the substrate-coating interface were kept the same by using proper AR designs. Moreover, 2 nm artificial gold particles with a density of 10\u2009\u2009mm<sup>-2</sup> were implanted into the substrate-coating interface to achieve reliable experimental results. An optical microscope (OM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used for an online LIDT test and offline LID morphology observation, respectively. The typical LID morphology of thicker AR coatings was flat bottom craters with diameters of 20-50 \u03bcm, which can be easily observed by an online OM. For thinner AR coatings, hemispherical craters with diameters down to 1 \u03bcm were found as typical LID morphology by a SEM. However, these tiny craters could not be observed by an online OM. Moreover, such tiny craters did not grow with subsequent pulses, so they did not degrade the functional laser damage resistance of the thin AR coatings. When identified with an online OM, the LIDT of thinner AR coatings is found to be about two times higher than the thicker ones, and large delamination was mainly found as the LID morphology of AR coatings with high fluence. When observed with a SEM, the LIDT of thin AR coatings with tiny craters was over 60% lower than the LIDT of thick AR coatings, which agrees with the model that less energy is required to form smaller LID craters of thinner coatings.",

An experiment consisting of 3D finite-difference time-domain simulations was conducted on two types of polarizers that prevent light penetration at a low and a high incident angular range (IAR). The EFI at the focal point region is six times lower, and the laser damage resistance is three times higher in the polarizer blocking light penetration in a high IAR. These results reveal for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that light penetration at a high IAR, rather than at a low IAR, contributes to EFI enhancement at the focal region of the nodules. Our findings may provide useful guidance in selecting optimal designs to suppress EFI enhancement at nodules in multilayer coatings.",

After establishing the geometric model of the nodules grown from \u03d5 1\u00a0\u03bcm SiO microspheres, the far-field scattering of the multiple nodules was determined by intensity superposition. For a nodule density of 100\u2009\u2009mm, there is good agreement between the simulated and measured ARS. The total scattering is \u223c500\u2009\u2009ppm for the multilayer coating with artificial nodules, which is more than 10 times that for the coating without nodules. Next, an iterative deposition-etching process was used to planarize the defects, which reduced scattering by almost one order of magnitude. Moreover, detailed characterization of the planarized seeds reveals that the planarization technology is a complex process, and it still does not produce a perfect flat surface. The results showed that there is a pit over each planarized seed in the coating surface, which leads to additional scattering. The possible reasons for the presence of these pits are briefly discussed, and the directions for further research are provided at the end of this Letter.",

        "abstract": "It has been verified that a broadband high-reflection (HR) film could restrain electric-field intensity (EFI) enhancement effect in the nodular defects at normal incidence. However, it\u2019s impossible to design an omnidirectional HR coatings to avoid the light penetration from all incident angles at oblique incidence. In this paper, the EFI enhancement is simulated by using a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) code. Two types of polarizers that prevent light penetration at low and high incident angular range (IAR) are proposed to explore the influence of transmission band at different angles in the case of oblique incidence. The damage morphologies of nodules initiating from different diameter silica microspheres in polarizers reproduce the simulated EFI distributions very well. These results indicate that light penetration at high IAR rather than at low IAR contributes mostly to EFI enhancement. Then, the conclusion is proved further by the films with low and high IAR at normal incidence. Controlling the angle position of transmission band at small angle can reduce the EFI enhancement in the usual case and increase the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of films.",

Five HfO 2  single layers with thicknesses ranging from 4\u201320\u00a0nm were deposited on fused silica substrates with ion-assisted deposition. Atomic force microscopy was first used to characterize the surface morphologies of the HfO 2  coatings. The surface morphologies of the thinner HfO 2  coatings duplicated the surface morphologies of the substrates. When the thickness was equal to or greater than 12\u00a0nm, grains appeared. The grain size and density increased with an increase in the thickness and resulted in a larger surface roughness. X-ray diffractometry can provide information about the grain size but the sensitivity of the method was not sufficient to determine whether the 12\u00a0nm HfO 2  coating was crystalline. Transmission electron microscopy exposed the cross-sectional microstructure of the HfO 2  coatings and electron diffraction verified that the HfO 2  coatings with a thickness equal to or greater than 12\u00a0nm were crystalline. Finally, the physical mechanism behind the observed thickness-dependent crystallization is proposed and discussed. When the coating thickness decreases to a critical value, the surface energy contributes considerably to the total energy, which suppresses the structural transformation from the amorphous to the polycrystalline state.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To improve the performance of TiO 2 /SiO 2  broadband antireflection (BBAR) coating prepared using ion assisted deposition, a hybrid approach was proposed to probe, deduce, and compensate for the thickness errors resulting from quartz crystal monitoring. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a thickness-dependent relative error was found in the prepared BBAR coating. Thinner layer had larger relative error and this was the main reason for the degradation of the performance of the BBAR coating. By fitting the thickness errors via a linear model, the origin of the thickness-dependent relative error is determined to be a constant thickness offset of the quartz crystal monitor. The thickness offsets are 1.5\u202fnm and 2.7\u202fnm for TiO 2  and SiO 2 , respectively. Finally, an approach through reverse engineering of a 4-layer coating was proposed to obtain the offsets for both materials. The results achieved are comparable to that obtained using TEM, but this approach is much more convenient. After compensating these offsets, a BBAR coating was prepared with transmittance higher than 99% from 450 to 900\u202fnm.",

Based on accurate characterization of Cr metal thin films, Cr/SiO<sub>2</sub> broadband absorbing films for 1064 nm YAG slab lasers are designed and fabricated to suppress ASE.

We designed and produced Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-HfO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> composite quarter-wave and non-quarter-wave HfO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> BBLD mirrors for the 30fs petawatt laser system. The laser damage properties of the BBLD mirrors were investigated in an uncompressed sub-nanosecond laser pulse. It showed that the Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-HfO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> composite BBLD mirror possessed higher LIDT due to the low electric-field intensity (EFI) in the case of the coating without artificial nodules. Nevertheless, the LIDT of the composite mirror was significantly lower than the non-quarter-wave HfO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> mirror when the nodules exist. The EFI simulation and damage morphology of the nodules analysis demonstrated that the nodule leading to the light intensification in the middle of the boundary between the nodular and the surrounding coating, thus the outermost HfO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> layers cannot protect the Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> layers, and resulting to the significantly low LIDT.

In this paper, we achieved a higher efficiency fiber coupled module based on 8 single emitter diode lasers providing more than 32.4 W output power from a 200 microns fiber core with an numerical aperture(NA) of 0.22 at 808 nm. Power of each LD can reach to 5 Watts at operation current. More than 83% coupling efficiency of the modular has been realized. This high power LD module can be used in laser plastics processing and laser meclical treatment fields.",

In this structure, a non-closed groove is etched to form a mesa for simplifying the processing and reducing the damage of devices. The 850 nm VCSEL arrays (including 2\u00d72, 3\u00d73 and 4\u00d74 array devices) with the non-closed type top emission structures are tested and analyzed. Results show that the continuous output powers are up to 80, 140 and 480 mW at room temperature, threshold currents are 0.15, 0.25 and 0.4 A, and the far-field divergence angles in parallel and vertical directions are 9\u00b0 and 9.6\u00b0, 13.5\u00b0 and 14.4\u00b0, 15\u00b0 and 14.4\u00b0, respectively. In the context of a pulse width of 50 \u03bcs and a pulse repetition rate of 100 Hz, the maximum output powers are 90, 318 and 1279 mW and the threshold currents are 0.2, 0.5 and 0.7 A, respectively. The power curves of chips are tested before and after packaged. The result shows that the heat saturation current of the chip after packaged is much higher than that of the chip before packaged, which suggests that good packaging can improve the cooling efficiency and reduce the effect of internal heating on the device performance.",

Multi-layer Al xGa 1-xAs structures with different Al compisition were grown on GaAs (001) substrates. The most suitable photon energy for monitoring the growth process was investigated. The NR and RAS signals at photon energy near the fundamental band gap showed an oscillatory behavior during the growth. The different contribution of surface-induced optical anisotropy and interface-induced optical anisotropy could be distinguished in situ by RAS transient spectra. The intensities of the RAS and NR signals were strongly dependent on the aluminium composition.",

During the growth, a significant dependence of the RAS and normalized reflectance signals on the aluminium composition has been found, which can be used to optimize the growth processes. The experimental results indicate that the period of normalized reflectance oscillation was directly related to the composition and growth rate. The first minimum of the normalized reflectance oscillation of Al xGa 1-xAs almost linearly with aluminium composition and could be used to determine the starting value of graded aluminium composition. The compositions and growth rate of Al xGa 1-xAs are calculated by normalized reflectance transient spectra, the value is in excellent agreement with the experimental data obtained by ex-situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD).",

Therefore, the scales of the lasers cannot be miniaturized because their cavities cannot be less than the half of the lasing wavelength. However, lasers based on the Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) can operate at a deep sub-wavelength, even nanometer scale. Moreover, the development of modern nanofabrication techniques provides the fabrication conditions for micro-or even nanometer scale lasers. This paper reviews the progress in nano-lasers based on SPPs that have been demonstrated recently. It describes the basic principles of the SPPs and gives structures and characteristics for several kinds of nanometer scale lasers. Then, it points out that the major defects of the nanometer scale lasers currently are focused on higher polariton losses and the difficulties in fabrication and electronic pumping technologies mentioned above. Finally, the paper considers the research and application prospects of the nanometer scale lasers based on the SPPs.",

Total salt content was 1.96 g\u00b7kg-1 in the new technique-used area, significantly lower than the contro(l2.67 g\u00b7kg-1). The cluster analysis showed that NaCl and Na2SO4 were the main soil salinity in the new technique-used area, while NaCl was the main soil salinity in the control. The mean concentrations of soil organic matter, available nitrogen and available phosphorus content in the new technique-used area were 17.53 g\u00b7kg-1 , 20.48 mg\u00b7kg-1 and 63.59 mg\u00b7kg-1 respectively, which were 1.42, 4.31 and 1.32 times as high as the control. In a word, compared with the traditional technique, the new technique of saline-alkali soil reclamation was more efficient on the aspects of maintaining soil moisture and nutrients, keeping soil loosening and preventing the soil salinization. Thus higher survival rate and annual growth of poplar plants was found in the new technique-used area. This study could provide a theoretical basis and reference for planting deep-rooted trees in the coastal heavy saline areas.",

The results showed that, during the leaching stage the drainage discharges in three experimental plots were great early, then decreased and kept stable roughly several days later. The drain spacing was smaller, the greater the stable drainage discharge among three plots, and the drainage water salinity was greater also at the early stage of three times leaching. The same leaching water column, desalinization of soils in the plot with 3 m spaced subsurface drains was more uniform, and was not very uniform with 9 m spaced subsurface drains. After three times leaching, the desalinization rates of 0~1 m soil layer in the plots with 3, 6 and 9 m spaced drains were 70.93%~73.40%, 64.68%~77.47% and 56.54%~78.78% respectively.

        "abstract": "In order to control the quality of irrigation and drainage, save water and land resources and reduce the cost of saline-alkali soil reclamation, it was necessary to design rationally irrigation and drainage engineering technical parameters. The paper proposed a new method to estimate technical parameters of irrigation and drainage engineering for coastal saline-alkali soil reclamation in Tianjin. It was assumed that soil was a homogeneous and isotropic porous medium, and the depth of flooded water on the surface of the land was very small. Under the condition of flooded leaching and draining, the water flow state can be considered two-dimensional steady. Based on Vedernikov infiltration equation, Van der Molen leaching equation and water balance equation, the solution for technical parameters was established. The proposed method was demonstrates through a case on reclamation of coastal saline-alkali soil by leaching and draining, and the results were more consistent with experience values in practical engineering. The research provided guidance for planning and design of saline-alkali soil improvement in Tianjin.",

Using data collected from mobile phone users in China via questionnaires, a total of 220 completed surveys available. We analyzed the data using structural equations modeling. We find that perceived usefulness, perceived trust, and perceived service cost affect mobile service subscribers' behavioral intention and that their trust in the service providers plays a significant role in the formation of their perceived trust. However, perceived trust has little effect on non-subscribers' intention. Our results also show how the availability of trial offers affects subscribers' and non-subscribers' intentions differently. \u00a9 2008 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In practice, in purchasing decision-making, many quantitative and qualitative factors, with vagueness and imprecision, have to be considered. This makes the decision process very complicated and unstructured. Besides the fuzzy sets theory, vague sets theory is one of the methods used to deal with uncertain information. Since vague sets can provide more information than fuzzy sets, it is considered superior in mathematical analysis of uncertain information. In this paper, a new approach based on vague sets group decision is proposed to deal with the supplier selection problem in supply chain systems. The work procedure is shown briefly, as follows: First, linguistic values are used to assess the ratings and weights for quantitative or qualitative factors. Second, degree of similarity and probability of vague sets are used to determine the ranking order of all alternatives. Finally, a numerical example of the selection problem of suppliers is shown, to highlight the procedure of the proposed approach, at the end of this paper.",

While many reports indicate that mobile banking service has been applied in China, little is known about how people perceived this service. This study applies technology acceptance model (TAM) and other three constructs to examine the factors that influence the adoption of mobile banking in China. The proposed model was empirically evaluated by using survey data collected from 209 users concerning their perceptions of mobile banking. The findings indicate that TAM can predict consumer intention to use mobile banking. Specifically, trust-based construct, perceived credibility, has significant effect on user's attitude toward mobile banking.

        "abstract": "Some modeling methods of virtual enterprise have been proposed such as workflow coordination modeling, supply chain modeling and agent-based modeling. But they all have some insufficient in some aspects to be improved. For example, they are difficult to be realized in process dynamic optimization. This paper proposes a service-based model for Virtual Enterprise workflows. Modeling the workflow execution as a cooperation of services allows different organizations to interact via well-defined interfaces. The paper primarily covers three models: the conceptual model of workflow for virtual enterprise, the service model and the execution model, it discusses the agile service choice and transfer mechanism of the virtual enterprise and shows how the execution can be optimized by selecting services depending on their contribution to quality criteria of the workflow. The model proposed in this paper has referenced and practical value for the thorough research and realization of the system.",

In this article, CPR is studied in the context of mobile value-added services (MVASs) from the view of sources of perceived risk, in which the antecedents of CPR and moderating effects of individual's characteristics on the relationships between antecedents and CPR are empirically examined. Based on Principle-Agent theory, the research model of perceived risk relationship was proposed, and then structural equation modeling and multi-regression were adopted to test the hypotheses. Results show that in the context of MVASs, consumers' perceived information asymmetry is the most correlated with perceived risk, and consumers perceived technology uncertainties and the intangibility of MVAS also have significant positive influences on consumers' perceived risk. Additionally, consumer's risk preference and knowledge about mobile commerce have significant moderating effects on the relationship between the risk antecedents and perceived risk.",

        "title": "A Coordinating Mechanism for Mobile Value-added Service Value Chain Based on Game Theory",
        "abstract": "Mobile Internet has become one of the most widely used applications since 3G was launched because it has significant influence on reconstructing a value chain.It has improved the channel power of the terminal,and lead to the inapplicability of the walled garden mode of the Mobile Network Operator(MNO) regarding to the mobile value-added service and the dual-channel phenomenon in the mobile value-added service market.The decentralized decision of companies in the value chain,dual-channel,and the competition among the Service Providers(SPs) on the mobile Internet makes the cooperation of the mobile value-added service value chain become different,and suggests higher requirements for coordination of mobile value-added service value chain.The coordination of the dual-channel system has not received enough attention in the existing researches.First,the existing coordinating mechanisms improve the system performance,but they do not achieve the overall optimum,and reasonably distribute the system's profit.The coordinating mechanism of the mobile value-added service value chain in the competition environment needs to be researched. Based on thepractice of Chinese mobile telecommunication industry and by extending the Tsay & Agrawal's study,a game theoretical mobile value-added service chain model is constructed.This model is composed of a MNO andtwo competitive SPs.A multi-side-payments mechanism is proposed to fully coordinate the dual-channel system of mobile value-added service. The mobilevalue-added services are classified into cooperative mobile service and mobile Internet service in this article,and the assumptions are as follows:(1) the mobile Internet service generates revenues for the SPs,(2) The demand volumes of services are assumed to depend on the marketing efforts of companies,(3) With each cooperation,the marketing effort for either the MNO or the SP exhibits a positive externality for the other,(4) The two SPs compete in mobile Interne services,and(5) It is a non-cooperative Stackelberg game between the three companies,as well as the SPS acts as a leader,and the MNO acts as a follower.The research firstly analyzes the equilibrium of the model,and finds that with the influence of upstream competition the marketing effort of MNO is lower when it is decentralized than when it is vertically integrated.However,whether the marketing effort of SPs is lower in decentralization depends on competition intensity.Second,the research solves the Pareto efficiency set of the mobile value-added service's dual-channel system,and designs three transfer functions and three constant side payments on the multi-side-payment mechanism.The transfer functions encourage companies to make decisions at global optimization level and divides system-wide surplus fairly.These functions also coordinate the cooperation between MNO and SPs,and the competition between SPs.The constant side payments equally allocate the system-wide surplus after coordination.Finally,the research validates the multi-side-payments mechanism with number simulation.With such coordination,the total channel profit in the decentralized decision situation equals to the vertically integrated situation.Each company receives more profit in this condition than in the pre-coordinating decentralized decision situation.The multi-side-payments satisfies the two criteria of properly developed coordination mechanism. Although there is competition between SPs and MNO,SPs can design multi-side-payments with certain revenue sharing ratio,negotiate their marketing efforts,and contract their transferring or transferred side payment in order to ensure better performance of each company.In summary,multi-side-payment mechanism is a significant reference for the coordination of mobile value-added service value chain in the mobile Internet environment.",

Although previous studies on the adoption of mobile services are quite extensive, few focus on customer satisfaction and loyalty to MIM in China. In this study, we examine the determinants of customer satisfaction and loyalty. The findings confirm that trust, perceived service quality, perceived customer value, including functional value and emotional value, contribute to generating customer satisfaction with MIM. The results also show that trust, customer satisfaction and switching cost directly enhance customer loyalty. Additionally, this study finds that age, gender, and usage time have moderating effects. Finally, implications for the marketing of MIM are discussed.",

Firstly, a carrier wave was designed to transform the time series with \u20330\u2033 s into a continuous and smooth series. Then an EMD-SVM forecasting model was proposed to forecast the modulated series. Lastly a detector was designed to detect the non-zero points based on the forecasts achieved. To verify the validity, several artificial data series were generated and tested. The experimental result shows that this method can achieve a high prediction accuracy on the occurrence of non-zero points.",

Since each independent node has it own simulation time, the universal time inquiry can not be done and then the universal simulation clock does not exist.

Whether or not users are satisfied with the services and remain loyalty to the service providers are important issues for the mobile service providers. The impact of trust,service quality perception value on customer satisfaction degree,and the impact of trust,customer satisfaction degree,and switching costs on customer loyalty are empirically exptored. By using survey data collected from 541 users,the results indicate that trust,service quality,functional value,and emotional value significantly affect the customer satisfaction. Moreover,customer satisfaction degree,trust,and switching cost have the significant influences on the customer loyalty.",

Knowledge sharing is crucial to the virtual enterprise. The case of knowledge sharing between two member enterprises without participant of hegemony enterprise has been discussed using Prisoner Dilemma Game Model. There are many factors may affect the strategy of member enterprise like utility of monopolizing the knowledge, the lost monopolizing benefit when sharing the knowledge and the cost of the knowledge sharing. The theory of complete and perfect two-stage dynamic game of knowledge sharing based on work competition model has been applied to the analysis on knowledge sharing in virtual enterprise. The member enterprise will choose knowledge sharing level to make marginal income equal to the value of negative utility by sharing its knowledge at Nash Equilibrium. The hegemony enterprise should formulate a reasonable stimulation policy and give enough bounty to the member enterprise who has contributed more knowledge to the virtual enterprise through knowledge sharing. There is a positive correlation between stimulation level and the variance of random item probability distribution of production function.",

Traditional\n methodology analyzes the risk evolution following a time invariant approach. However, this paper analyzes and proposes wavelet\n analysis to track risk evolution in a time variant fashion. A wavelet-econometric hybrid model is further proposed for VaR\n estimates. The proposed wavelet decomposed VaR (WDVaR) is ex-ante in nature and is capable of estimating risks that are multi-scale\n structured. Empirical studies in major agricultural markets are conducted for both the hybrid ARMA-GARCH VaR and the proposed\n WDVaR. Experiment results confirm significant performance improvement. Besides, incorporation of time variant risks tracking\n capability offers additional flexibility for adaptability of the proposed hybrid algorithm to different market environments.\n WDVaR can be tailored to specific market characteristics to capture unique investment styles, time horizons, etc.\n ",

        "abstract": "With the development of e-commerce, many \"bricks-and-mortar\" firms have transformed to \"clicks-and-mortar\" by incorporating online stores. The physical stores can satisfy the instant demand, while the online stores satisfy the forward demand, i.e., customers place orders online, and the firm fulfills the orders in quoted delivery time. Since the physical stores and the online stores of a \"click-and-mortar\" firm usually replenish inventory using the same replenishment channel, we examine the optimal order policy and the optimal price adjustment time for a \"click-and-mortar\" firm, and drive the optimal pricing strategy in every period. We also analyze the optimal order and pricing policies when price adjustment time is known and unknown using numerical examples. Finally, some possible further research lines are outlined.",

The key to enhancing the quality of decision making in the supplier selection function is to take advantage of the powerful computer-related concepts, tools and techniques that have become available in the last few years. In this paper a system that applied a technique with neural networks to select suppliers was described. The performance history, quality history, geography and price of a supplier were selected as determinant factors effecting the supplier selection. Considering the features of supplier selection and neural network models, a backpropagation neural network that includes a hidden layer was used to help selection decision.",

This approach is under a \"decomposition-and-ensemble\" principal to decompose the original erratic demand series into several independent \"smooth\" subseries including a small number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue by EEMD technique. Then SVMs are used to model each of the subseries so as to achieve more accurate forecast respectively. Finally, the forecasts of all subseries are aggregated by a SVMs model to formulate an ensemble forecast for the erratic demand series. Four artificial data sets were used to test the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

        "abstract": "Deadlock is one type of errors in most multi-threaded programs, and it hasn't been well settled until today. In this paper, a dynamic detection algorithm for finding resource deadlocks in concurrent Java programs has been proposed. Based on the execution trace information of a concurrent program, it produces locking control dependency relations firstly. Subsequently, the potential deadlocks can be worked out through imposing some relation calculations on the achieved locking control dependency relations. Furthermore, some static information of inter-thread control flow graph (ITCFG) is introduced to increase the precision of results. The presented algorithm is so simple that it can be easily implemented; on the other hand, it doesn't need to construct graphical representation such as lock tree and lock graph in the existing methods.",

In this paper, we firstly combine VPRS and AHP to obtain the weight of condition attribute sets decided by each decision-maker (DM). Then, the integrated risk exposure (IRE) of attributes is obtained based on the three VPRS-based models. Subsequently, a new procedure of obtaining @b\"k-stable intervals for DM\"k is investigated. To verify the effectiveness of these proposed methods, an illustrative example is presented. The experimental results suggest that the VPRS-based IRE have advantages in recognizing important attributes.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a comprehensive but simple methodology to valuate information technology investment in a nuclear power station based on fuzzy risk analysis and real option approach. By linking the variability of expected payoffs to specific sources of risk factors, this method could help decision makers achieve a more reliable valuation of the target investment under multiple sources of risk, and avoid complex estimation tasks at the same time. The proposed approach can be easily adopted to value any irreversible investment subject to a high degree of uncertainty that is common in the field of energy economics.",

However,little research has been done on the consumer trust of transactional services in the context of mobile commerce. Based on the technology acceptance model,this study builds a model of consumer trust of mobile stock service to analyze impacts of perceived ease of use,perceived usefulness,perceived security,information quality,propensity to trust and convenience on consumers' trust of mobile stock,and effects of perceived ease of use,perceived usefulness and trust of mobile stock on usage intention. Through a survey which collects 224 valid questionnaires,we use the SPSS and the PLS-Graph software to conduct statistical analysis. The empirical results indicate that information quality,propensity to trust,perceived security and perceived usefulness have positive impacts on consumers' trust of mobile stock,but convenience and perceived ease of use have little effects on consumers' trust of mobile stock,while consumers' trust is the key factor which motivates them to use the mobile stock. Finally,the authors put forward useful suggestions for the mobile stock provider and point out the directions of further research.",

This study also verifies the influence of critical crowdsourcing project characteristics, such as project mode, project purpose, project type, and number of participants, on crowdsourcing project risks. On the basis of the quantitative data collected from 403 crowdsourcees and crowdsourcers through an online survey in China, results of cluster and multivariate analyses of variance indicate that the mean level of each risk dimension consistently moves with the change in cluster risk levels. Technical-related risks are more critical than social-related ones in crowdsourcing projects. Task risk is the most significant risk dimension. All risk dimensions (i.e., crowdsourcer, relationship, crowdsourcee, complexity, requirement, and task) are negatively associated with crowdsourcing project performance. Each risk dimension is considerably influenced by various characteristics of crowdsourcing projects.",

In this paper, a novel joint replenishment and synthetical delivery (JRD) model is proposed to improve the coordination of replenishment and delivery processes. Traditional, in a warehouse centralized supply chain, orders from online customers are usually delivered independently after multiple items have been jointly replenished. To decrease the outbound delivery cost, a new delivery strategy considering synthetical dispatched orders, orders and customers matching, and customer visiting sequence is proposed. Three new beta-heuristic algorithms, namely, quantum evolution algorithm (QEA), differential evolution algorithm (DE) and quantum differential evolution algorithm (QDE), are utilized to solve the proposed JRD. The most important parts of each algorithm (initialization, reproduction and mutation, and selection) are redesigned according to the structure of the decision variables. Numerical experiments are conducted to find the best parameter settings and potential searching abilities of each algorithm. Finally, experimental results show the superiorities of the proposed DE and QDE in terms of searching speed, accuracy, and robustness.",

The role of information technology (IT) in knowledge management has always been a debatable topic in literature and practice. Despite existing documentation regarding the relationship between IT resource and knowledge management, limited information is available on the different types of IT resources describing this relationship. We integrate two research streams emerging in knowledge management and extend the literature on IT-knowledge management linkage by investigating the moderating role of resource commitment to invoke a contingent resource perspective. Data from 168 organizations in China provide empirical evidence that three types of IT resources (i.e., IT infrastructure, IT human, and IT relationship) positively affect knowledge management capability (KMC), which is positively related to competitive advantage. Furthermore, this study identifies two positive quasi-moderating effects of resource commitment on the IT resource-KMC relationship. Specifically, resource commitment directly and positively enhances KMC, and strengthens the effects of IT human and IT relationship resources on KMC. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the results.",

Based on data collected on 128 completed IT projects, we examine the moderating effects of requirement and user risk on the relationship between controls and process performance from the perspectives of both the project manager and the user liaison. Both risks were found to suppress the relationship between controls and process performance for each group. While both formal and informal control explain a significant amount of variance in process performance, formal control had a more significant role than informal control from the PM perspective, whereas informal controls play a more significant role than formal controls from the user perspective. The relationship between formal control and process performance was found to be stronger for PMs than for users.",

The purpose of this paper is to develop a validated risk profile of crowdsourcing and investigate the relationships among different types of risks and those between risks and performance in crowdsourcing.Design/methodology/approachBased on the quantitative data collected from 136 crowdsourcing participants in China, two dimensions (i.e. social system and technical system risks) and five sub-dimensions (i.e. crowdsourcer, relationship, crowdsourcee, complexity, and requirement) of crowdsourcing risks are developed and validated. A theoretical model that integrates crowdsourcing risks and performance is developed. The technique of partial least squares is employed to assess the measurement model and test the hypotheses.FindingsThe empirical evidence determines the positive association of social system risks with technical system risks, which in turn negatively affect crowdsourcing performance. Specifically, relationship risk is positively affected by crowdsourcer and crowdsourcee risks, and these risks positively affect requirement and complexity risks. However, requirement and complexity risks negatively affect crowdsourcing performance.Originality/valueThis study explores the interrelationship between various risks and the relationship between risk and performance in the context of crowdsourcing by integrating risk-based view with socio-technical theory. Systematic but different risk mitigation strategies should be designed in crowdsourcing to manage risks and enhance performance.",

This paper proposes a new and practical joint replenishment and delivery (JRD) model by considering trade credit. However, because of the complex mathematical properties of JRD, high-quality solutions to the problem have eluded researchers. We design an effective hybrid differential evolution algorithm based on simulated annealing (HDE-SA) that can resolve this non-deterministic polynomial hard problem in a robust and precise way. After determining the suitable parameters by a parameter-tuning test, we verify the performance of the HDE-SA through numerical JRD examples. Compared with the results of other popular evolutionary algorithms, results of randomly generated JRDs indicate that HDE-SA can always obtain slightly lower total costs than differential evolution algorithm (DE) and genetic algorithm (GA) under different situations. Moreover, the convergence rate of the HDE-SA is higher t...",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we deal with the problem of determining the optimal economic operating policy when a number of non-instantaneous deteriorating items are jointly replenished. We establish a multi-item joint replenishment model for non-instantaneous deteriorating items under constant demand rate allowing full backlogging. This problem is challenging, in particular, the cost function is a piecewise function with exponential parts, which makes the problem more complicated. To solve this problem, an approximation method is used to simplify the objective function and a bound-based heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the model. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the quality of the approximation. Experimental results on a real-life case study show that the proposed model can achieve substantial cost savings compared to the individual replenishment policy for non-instantaneous deteriorating items. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of key parameters is carried out and th...",

The electromagnetic field, energy flow, and current density are analyzed by finite element method (FEM). In time domain, the electric field component   and current density   perpendicular to the multi-quantum wells (MQWs) are symmetric and asymmetric distributions over the gold grating, respectively, which precisely prove the existence of LRSPPs. The averaged | | across the whole quantum well region reaches 1.51\u2009(V/m) when the electric field intensity (| |) of normal incidence is 1\u2009(V/m) at 4.65\u00a0\u03bcm. Extraordinarily low loss of the LRSPPs results in a coupling efficiency enhancement ratio of 2.23 in AlGaN/GaN QWIP compared with that obtained via bare gold grating with different polarized sources, exhibiting great potential for application in the focal plane arrays.",

        "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to identify relevant items for particular users in large-scale online applications. The historical rating data of users is a valuable input resource for many recommendation models such as collaborative filtering (CF), but these models are known to suffer from the rating sparsity problem when the users or items under consideration have insufficient rating records. With the continued growth of online social networks, the increased user-to-user relationships are reported to be helpful and can alleviate the CF rating sparsity problem. Although researchers have developed a range of social network-based recommender systems, there is no unified model to handle multirelational social networks. To address this challenge, this paper represents different user relationships in a multigraph and develops a multigraph ranking model to identify and recommend the nearest neighbors of particular users in high-order environments. We conduct empirical experiments on two real-world datasets: 1) Epinions and 2) Last.fm, and the comprehensive comparison with other approaches demonstrates that our model improves recommendation performance in terms of both recommendation coverage and accuracy, especially when the rating data are sparse.",

The adopted rectangular iso-frequency surface results in the inhomogereity of wave-like two-dimensional photonic crystal unavoidably, so the imaging is confined in the near-field region. For the lack of the circular-shaped iso-frequency surface in photonic crystal matching that of the incident medium, far-field imaging based on negative refraction is unavailable in wave-like two-dimensional photonic crystal. The finite-difference time-domain method is used to simulate the near-field imaging in wave-like two-dimensional photonic crystal of different thickness. The resolution of 0.28\u03bb is achieved for single point source when the thickness of photonic crystal is twice of lattice constant. The resolution will gradually degrade as the source moves beyond the near-field domain. Meanwhile, the image is strongly confined in the near-field region on the other side of photonic crystal in spite of the change of source position and photonic crystal thickness. In order to further demonstrate the subwavelength imaging ability of wave-like two-dimensional photonic crystal, double sources are used. Resolution of 0.35\u03bb is obtained, but the imaging quality depends on the thickness of photonic crystal greatly.",

The sphere-substrate contact method was usually used because it is rather difficult to make two micrometer or submicrometer spheres contact each other precisely. Here, we used the sphere-sphere contact method via a novel, simple process to investigate the deformation of spheres. The silica particle size ranges from 400 to 900 nm. Traditionally, the harder the particle, the smaller both the contact radius and the adhesion force. Therefore, it is widely accepted that silica particles should undergo elastic deformation, but we found that silica particles underwent plastic deformation rather than elastic deformation because of van der Waals interaction. The contact radii were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",

The vitrified slag can form in the process of plasma treatment of inorganic wastes and effectively fix heavy metals, and its leaching rate is very low. Explained the formation mechanism of vitrified slag using the concept of silicon-oxygen ratio, and verified by experiment. Concluded that the vitrified slag can form at silicon-oxygen ratio less than 3, and crystal will grow at silicon-oxygen ratio more than 3. Find out the most important factors among 7 factors, including silicon-oxygen ratio, basicity, heavy metal contents, temperature, treating time, fly-ash types and constituents, to the heavy metal fixed efficiency using a 30 kW DC plasma arc reactor system. Concluded that the temperature and the heavy metal contents are the most important factors and directly influenced the heavy metal As, Pb and Zn fixed efficiency, the other 5 factors little effect on the heavy metal fixed efficiency. With increasing temperature, the heavy metal fixed efficiency dropped. As the heavy metal contents increases, the heavy metal fixed efficiency increased and then decreased before, and reached a maximum value at 6mg \u00b7 g-1. But all of 7 factors didn't effect to the metal Cr fixed efficiency, the heavy metal Cr fixed efficiency are more than 85% in all experiments. The heavy metal fixed process is divided into 4 stages depend on the temperature of crucibles wall heated. 80% of escape heavy metal run away at volatilization period which last 6-10 minutes from heat beginning. So how to control the heavy metals running away at volatilization period is the best way to improve the heavy metals fixed efficiency. \u00a9 All Rights Reserved.",

In the present study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques were adopted to detect the metabolic effects of  gene in follicular fluid (FF) and ovarian vein serum (OVS) in Small Tail Han (STH) sheep. ANOVA and random forest statistical methods were employed for the identification of important metabolic pathways and biomarkers. Changes in amino acid metabolism, redox environment, and energy metabolism were observed in FF from the three  genotype STH ewes. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) showed that metabolic effects of  gene are more pronounced in FF than in OVS. Therefore, the difference of the metabolic profile in FF is also affected by the  genotypes. In Spearman correlation analysis, key metabolites (e.g., glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, aspartate, asparagine, glutathione oxidized (GSSG), cysteine-glutathione disulfide, \u03b3-glutamylglutamine, and 2-hydrosybutyrate) in ovine FF samples showed a significant correlation with the ovulation rate. Our findings will help to explain the metabolic mechanism of high prolificacy ewes and benefit fertility identification.",

Opportunities to increase sheep litter size include identifying single gene mutations with major effects on ovulation rate and litter size. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 89 Chinese domestic sheep from nine different geographical locations and ten Australian sheep were analyzed to detect new polymorphisms affecting litter size. Comparative genomic analysis of sheep with contrasting litter size detected a novel set of candidate genes. Two SNPs, g.71874104G>A and g.71833755T>C, were genotyped in 760 Small Tail Han sheep and analyzed for association with litter size. The two SNPs were significantly associated with litter size, being in strong linkage disequilibrium in the region 71.80\u207b71.87 Mb. This haplotype block contains one gene that may affect litter size, Histone Cell Cycle Regulator ().  mRNA levels in sheep with different lambing ability were significantly higher in ovaries of Small Tail Han sheep (high fecundity) than in Sunite sheep (low fecundity). Moreover, the expression levels of  in eight tissues of uniparous Small Tail Han sheep were significantly higher than in multiparous Small Tail Han sheep ( < 0.05).  SNPs significantly affect litter size in sheep and are useful as genetic markers for litter size.",

The  (beta-1, 4--acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 2) gene was considered as the potential  mutation gene. This study explores whether the effect of the  mutation exists in other sheep breeds, and the features of the  gene in terms of the molecular structure and its expression profile. Using Sanger sequencing, we found that high and low fecundity breeds from among 11 measured sheep breeds all had no variation in the three specific mutation sites, which were linked with the  mutation. However, two mutations of g.36946470C > T and g.36933082C > T in the exon of  had a significant effect on litter size in the first parity for Small Tail Han (STH) Sheep ( < 0.05). Two transcription start sites (TSS) of  in its 5'-flanking region were discovered in ovine granule cells in vitro, through the RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA ends) method. Except for in the kidney and oviduct, no significant difference in expression levels had been found between STH sheep and Tan sheep breeds. The  gene, as a candidate for , may have a relationship with the differences in litter size in STH sheep.  is mainly expressed in the ovine ovary, which also suggests that  plays an important role in sheep reproduction.",

        "abstract": "The diverse functions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which execute their functions mainly through modulating the activities of their target genes, have been have been widely studied for many years (including a number of studies involving lncRNAs in the ovary and uterus). Herein, for the first time, we detect lncRNAs in sheep hypothalami with FecB++ through RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and identify a number of known and novel lncRNAs, with 622 and 809 found to be differentially expressed in polytocous sheep in the follicular phase (PF) vs. monotocous sheep in the follicular phase (MF) and polytocous sheep in the luteal phase (PL) vs. monotocous sheep in the luteal phase (ML), respectively. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed based on the predicted target genes. The most highly enriched GO terms (at the molecular function level) included carbonyl reductase (NADPH), 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (NADP+), and prostaglandin-E2 9-reductase activity in PF vs. MF, and phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate binding in PL vs. ML was associated with sheep fecundity. Interestingly, the phenomena of valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation in PL vs. ML, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis in PF vs. MF, were present. In addition, the interactome of lncRNA and its targets showed that MSTRG.26777 and its targets ENSOARG00000013744, ENSOARG00000013700, and ENSOARG00000013777, and MSTRG.105228 and its target WNT7A may participate in the sheep reproductive process at the hypothalamus level. Significantly, MSTRG.95128 and its target Forkhead box L1 (FOXG1) were shown to be upregulated in PF vs. MF but downregulated in PL vs. ML. All of these results may be attributed to discoveries of new candidate genes and pathways related to sheep reproduction, and they may provide new views for understanding sheep reproduction without the effects of the  mutation.",

        "abstract": "Reproduction, as a physiologically complex process, can significantly affect the development of the sheep industry. However, a lack of overall understanding to sheep fecundity has long blocked the progress in sheep breeding and husbandry. Herein, in present study, we aimed to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from hypothalamus in sheep without FecB mutation in two comparison groups: polytocous (PF) versus (vs.) monotocous (MF) sheep at follicular phase and polytocous (PL) vs. monotocous (ML) sheep at luteal phase. We totally identified 5058 proteins in sheep hypothalamus, where 22 in PF vs. MF, and 39 proteins in PL vs. ML were differentially expressed, respectively. We then conducted a functional analysis including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis to reveal the potential roles of these DEPs. The proteins ENSOARP00000020097, ENSOARP00000006714, GH, HDAC4, and XRN2 in PF vs. MF, and BAG4, IGF1R, HSD11B1, and TTR in PL vs. ML appeared to modulate reproduction, presumably by influencing the activities of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In addition, HH3, a DEPs identified in PL vs. ML, may participate in regulating reproduction by way of methylation and acetylation. This study provides an alternative method to identify DEPs associated with sheep prolificacy from the hypothalamus. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the genetic mechanism of sheep prolificacy, protein profiling of ovaries in the follicular and luteal phases was conducted. The tandem mass tag technique was used to analyze the proteomes of ovaries from STH sheep that did not have the FecB mutation in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1B gene. Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) was operated to validate the target differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). The result showed, a total of 34,037 peptides were found, and 5074 proteins were identified. The screened DAPs strictly related to energy metabolism, hormone synthesis, ovarian function were significantly enriched in oxidative phosphorylation(COX7A, ND5, and UQCR10), ovarian steroidogenesis(StAR and HSD3B), taurine and hypotaurine metabolism(CSAD), glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-heparin sulfate/heparin(GLCE), necroptosis(H2AX, AIFM1, and FTH1), protein digestion and absorption(COL4A1 and COL4A5) and glycosaminoglycan degradation(HYAL2 and HEXB) pathways. These analyses indicated that the reproductive performance of sheep is regulated through different pathways. In consequence, these findings are an important resource that can be used in future studies of the genetic mechanism of high fecundity traits in sheep, and these DAPs can be further investigated as candidate markers to predict prolificacy of sheep. SIGNIFICANCE: Litter size is an important quantitative trait, but the genetic mechanism of high-prolificacy is still unclear in sheep. Our study identified potential signaling pathways and differentially abundant proteins related to reproductive performance. These findings will facilitate a better revealing the mechanism and provide possible targets for molecular design breeding for the formation of polytocous traits in sheep.",

This study was designed to determine effects of melatonin treatment of donors on methylation modification of pre-pubertal cumulus cells. Cumulus cells from germinal vesicle stage cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from eighteen lambs which were randomly divided into control group (C) and melatonin group given an 18 mg melatonin implant subcutaneous (M). Compared to the C group, the M group had higher concentrations of melatonin in plasma and follicular fluid ( < 0.05), greater superovulation, a higher proportion of fully expanded COCs, and a lower proportion of apoptotic cumulus cells ( < 0.05). Real-time PCR results showed that melatonin up-regulated expression of genes , , ,  and , but down-regulated expression of genes ,  and  ( < 0.05). Furthermore, melatonin increased FI of FITC (global methylation level) on cumulus cells ( < 0.05). To understand the regulation mechanism, the  promoter methylation sequence were analyzed. Compared to the C group, although there was less methylation at two CpG sites of  ( < 0.05) and higher methylation at two CpG sites of  ( < 0.05), there were no significant differences in methylation of the detected  and  promoter regions. However, there were lower methylation levels at five CpG sites of , which decreased methylation of detected  promoter region on M group ( < 0.05). In conclusion, alterations of methylation regulated by melatonin may mediate development of cumulus cells in lambs.",

        "abstract": "Melatonin as a potent antioxidant exhibits important nutritional and medicinal values. To produce melatonin-enriched milk will benefit the consumers. In this study, a sheep bioreactor which generates melatonin-enriched milk has been successfully developed by the technology that combined CRISPR/Cas9 system and microinjection. The AANAT and ASMT were cloned from pineal gland of Dorper sheep (Ovis aries). The in vitro studies found that AANAT and ASMT were successfully transferred to the mammary epithelial cell lines and significantly increased melatonin production in the culture medium compared to the nontransgenic cell lines. In addition, the Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and the linearized vectors pBC1-AANAT and pBC1-ASMT were co-injected into the cytoplasm of pronuclear embryos which were implanted into ewes by oviducts transferring. Thirty-four transgenic sheep were generated with the transgenic positive rate being roughly 35% which were identified by Southern blot and sequencing. Seven carried transgenic AANAT, two carried ASMT, and 25 carried both of AANAT and ASMT genes. RT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated that the lambs expressed these genes in their mammary epithelial cells and these animals produced melatonin-enriched milk. This is the first report to show a functional AANAT and ASMT transgenic animal model which produce significantly high levels of melatonin milk compared to their wild-type counterparts. The advanced technologies used in the study laid a foundation for generating large transgenic livestock, for example, the cows, which can produce high level of melatonin milk.",

        "abstract": "To explore the anti-inflammatory activity of endogenous produced melatonin, a melatonin-enriched animal model (goat) with AANAT transfer was successfully generated with somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology. Basically, a pIRES2-EGFP-AANAT expression vector was constructed and was transferred into the female fetal fibroblast cells (FFCs) via electrotransfection and then the nuclear of the transgenic FFC was transferred to the eggs of the donor goats. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the transgenic offspring expressed significantly higher levels of AANAT and melatonin synthetic function than those PBMCs from the wild-type (WT) animals. After challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the transgenic PBMCs had increased autophagosomes and LC3B expression while they exhibited suppressed production of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL1B and IL12 (IL12A-IL12B/p70), compared to their WT. The mechanistic analysis indicated that the anti-inflammatory activity of endogenous melatonin was mediated by MTNR1B (melatonin receptor 1B). MTNR1B stimulation activated the MAPK14 signaling pathway to promote cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, thus, suppressing the excessive inflammatory response of cellular. However, when the intact animals challenged with LPS, the serum proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in the transgenic goats than that in the WT. The results indicated that endogenous melatonin inhibited the MAPK1/3 signaling pathway and ROS production, subsequently downregulated gene expression of BECN1, ATG5 in PMBCs and then suppressed the autophagy activity of PBMCs and finally elevated levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines in transgenic animals Herein we provided a novel melatonin-enriched animal model to study the potential effects of endogenously produced melatonin on inflammatory responses and autophagy activity.",

Increased activation of TLR4 can markedly enhance the internalization of . In this study, the relationship between TLR4 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in mediating  internalization was evaluated in sheep monocytes. Using a TLR4-overexpressing transgenic (Tg) sheep model, we explored the bacterial internalization mechanism in sheep. We found that monocytes of Tg sheep could phagocytize more bacteria and exhibited higher adhesive capacity. The specific inhibition of p38 MAPK or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) reduced TLR4-dependent internalization of bacteria into sheep monocytes. Furthermore, the inhibition of MAPK signaling down-regulated the adhesive capacity of monocytes and the expression of scavenger receptors and adhesion molecules. Taken together, the overexpression of TLR4 in transgenic sheep enhanced the internalization of  via MAPK signaling.",

        "abstract": "Physical damage and oxidative stress may occur in prepubertal cumulus cells, due to insufficient glutathione synthesis. To determine potential epigenetic mechanisms related to antioxidant effects of melatonin on ovine prepubertal cumulus cells, 30 lambs, 4-wk-old were randomly allocated into two groups: a control (C, n=20) group and a melatonin (M, n=10) group given a subcutaneous implant containing 18mg melatonin. All lambs were superovulated (250 IU FSH and 250 IU eCG). Cumulus cells from germinal vesicle stage cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected by ovarian follicular aspiration and dissociated with hyaluronidase. Compared to the C group, the M group had greater superovulation, better antioxidant capacity, a higher proportion of fully expanded COCs and a lower proportion of apoptotic cumulus cells (P < 0.05). Melatonin up-regulated mRNA expression of genes for melatonin receptors MT1 and nuclear binding site ROR\u03b1, antioxidants (SOD1, GPx4 and CAT) and cumulus cell expansion (PTX3, HAS2 and PTGS2), as well as Bcl2, but down-regulated expression of Bax (P < 0.05). Regarding epigenetics, there were less methylation at five CpG sites of SOD1, three CpG sites of GPx4 and two CpG sites of CAT in M versus C groups (P < 0.05), leading to lower total methylation of SOD1, GPx4 and CAT promoters region on M group (P < 0.05). In a mechanistic study, addition of MT1 or ROR\u03b1 antagonist increased ROS and MDA concentrations, but decreased T-AOC, GPx, CAT and T-SOD concentrations (P < 0.05), whereas there were no significant difference between the melatonin and MT2 antagonist treatment groups for T-AOC, GPx, CAT and T-SOD concentrations. Furthermore, addition of ROR\u03b1 agonist decreased total DNA methylation of SOD1, GPx4 and CAT, with no significant difference after MT1 agonist treatment. These studies provided new information regarding epigenetic mechanisms by which melatonin promoted ovine prepubertal cumulus cells antioxidant through ROR\u03b1, both in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a crucial role in innate inflammatory responses, as it recognizes gram-negative bacteria (or their products) and contributes greatly to host defense against invading pathogens. Though TLR4 overexpressing transgenic sheep, resistant to certain diseases related with gram-negative bacteria, had been bred in our previous research, the effects of overexpression of TLR4 on innate immune response remained unclear. In this study, TLR4 overexpressing ovine macrophages were obtained from peripheral blood, and it was found that the overexpression of TLR4 initially promoted the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 by activating TLR4-mediated IRAK4-dependent NF-\u03baB and MAPK (JNK and ERK1/2) signaling following LPS stimulation. However, this effect was later impaired due to increased internalization of TLR4 into endosomal compartment of the macrophages. Then the overexpression of TLR4 triggered TBK1-dependent interferon-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) expression, which in turn led to the induction of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-inducible genes (i.e.IP10, IRG1 and GARG16). Understandably, an increased IFN-\u03b2 level facilitated phosphorylation of STAT1 to induce expression of innate antiviral genes Mx1 and ISG15, suggesting that TLR4 overexpressing macrophages were equipped better against viral infection. Correspondingly, the bacterial burden in these macrophages, after infection with live S. Typhimurium, was decreased significantly. In summary, the results indicated that overexpression of TLR4 could enhance innate inflammatory responses, initiate the innate antiviral immunity, and control effectively S. Typhimurium growth in ovine macrophages.",

        "abstract": "It has been well proved that melatonin participates in the regulation of the seasonal reproduction of ewes. However, the effects of short term treatment of melatonin on ewe's ovulation are still to be clarified. In this study, the effects of melatonin on the number of embryos harvested from superovulation, and the pregnant rate in recipients after embryo transferred have been investigated. Hu sheep with synchronous estrus treatment were given melatonin subcutaneously injection (0, 5, and 10 mg/ewe, respectively). It was found that the estrogen level in the group of 5 mg melatonin was significantly higher than that of other two groups at the time of sperm insemination (\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The pregnant rate and number of lambs in the group of 5 mg melatonin treatment was also significantly higher than that of the rests of the groups (\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In another study, 31 Suffolk ewes as donors and 103 small-tailed han sheep ewes as recipients were used to produce pronuclear embryo and embryo transfer. Melatonin (5 mg) was given to the donors during estrus. The results showed that, the number of pronuclear embryos and the pregnancy rate were also significantly higher in melatonin group than that in the control group. In addition, 28 donors and 44 recipient ewes were used to produce morula/blastocyst and embryo transferring. Melatonin (5 mg) was given during estrus. The total number of embryos harvested (7.40 \u00b1 1.25/ewe vs. 3.96 \u00b1 0.73/ewe, \u00a0<\u00a00.05) and the pregnant rate (72.3 \u00b1 4.6% vs. 54.7 \u00b1 4.0%, \u00a0<\u00a00.05) and number of lambs were also increased in melatonin group compared to the control group. Collectively, the results have suggested that melatonin treatment 36 hours after CIDR withdrawal could promote the number and quality of embryos  condition and increased the pregnant rate and number of lambs.",

        "abstract": "To improve the efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) in sheep, we investigated the effects of recipient oocyte source, number of transferred embryos, and season on the pregnancy and live kid rates for sheep somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-stimulated ovaries produced significantly more oocytes both in total and of suitable quality for maturation culture than those without FSH treatment (from slaughterhouse). However, their in vitro maturation rates was similar. Embryos were reconstructed using adult fibroblast cells into enucleated MII oocytes. The pregnancy and term rates were significantly higher in the FSH-stimulated group than in the slaughterhouse one. Oocytes from FSH-stimulated ovaries were enucleated as recipient cytoplasm for nuclear transfer in the following experiments. The transfer of 7-9 and 11-13 embryos produced significantly higher pregnancy rates than that of 6 embryos. However, the former groups exhibited similar live kid rates. FSH-stimulated ovaries produced significantly more oocytes in November and December (winter) than in May to July (summer), but the associated maturation rate did not increase. Pregnancy and term rates were significantly higher when transfer occurred in winter than in summer. In conclusion, FSH treatment produced significant benefit regarding the number and quality of collected oocytes, and also for the pregnancy and live kid rates for reconstructed embryos. However, the transfer of an appropriate number of embryos (7-13) and at an appropriate season (winter) increased pregnancy and term rates. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Many groups of Gram-negative bacteria cause diseases that are harmful to sheep. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is critical for detecting Gram-negative bacteria by the innate immune system, is activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to initiate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Oxidation intermediates are essential activators of oxidative stress, as low levels of free radicals form a stressful oxidative environment that can clear invading pathogens. NO is an oxidation intermediate and its generation is regulated by nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase (GCHI) is the rate-limiting enzyme for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis, which is essential for the production of inducible iNOS. Previously, we made vectors to overexpress the sheep TLR4 gene. Herein, first generation (G1) of transgenic sheep was stimulated with LPS in vivo and in vitro, and oxidative stress and GCHI expression were investigated. Oxidative injury caused by TLR4 overexpression was tightly regulated in tissues. However, the transgenic (Tg) group still secreted nitric oxide (NO) when an iNOS inhibitor was added. Furthermore, GCHI expression remained upregulated in both serum and monocytes/macrophages. Thus, overexpression of TLR4 in transgenic sheep might accelerate the clearance of invading microbes through NO generation following LPS stimulation. Additionally, TLR4 overexpression also enhances GCHI activation.",

        "abstract": "The developmental capacity of in vitro-matured oocytes and in vitro-fertilized embryos from pre-pubertal sheep is less than that of adult counterparts, and epigenetic mechanisms are thought to be involved. In the present study, germinal vesicle stage oocytes were collected by follicular aspiration from superovulated 4-week-old lambs and 2.5-year-old ewes. There were evaluations of the developmental potential of oocytes and embryos by in vitro culture and fertilization, global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns by immunofluorescence staining, and relative abundance of enzyme mRNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis in pre-pubertal and adult sheep donors. The results showed that the rates of maturation and cleavage of oocytes as well as pregnancy and lambing rates from the transfer of 2-cell embryos collected from lambs were less than those from adults (P<0.05). The global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and relative abundance of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Tet3 mRNA were less at all stages of oocytes, zygotes, and two-cell embryos from lambs compared with those from adults (P<0.05) with no difference in relative abundance of Dnmt3b mRNA. Thus, younger donor age was associated with disturbed DNA methylation processes due to insufficient methyltransferases during gametogenesis and early embryonic development, and this may be responsible for the lesser developmental potential of oocytes and early developing embryos when oocytes are collected from lambs.",

However, the expression and function of c-cbl in the regulation of neuropathic pain after chronic constriction injury (CCI) are unknown. In rat CCI model, c-cbl inhibited the activation of spinal cord microglia and the release of pro-inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which alleviated mechanical and heat pain through down-regulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Additionally, exogenous TNF-\u03b1 inhibited c-cbl protein level vice versa. In the primary microglia transfected with c-cbl siRNA, when treated with TNF-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor, the corresponding secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 did not change. In summary, CCI down-regulated c-cbl expression and induced the activation of microglia, then activated microglia released inflammatory factors via ERK signaling to cause pain. Our data might supply a novel molecular target for the therapy of CCI-induced neuropathic pain.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of TRAF2 and its possible role in FJOA. We observed an up-regulation of TRAF2 in FJOA by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) compared to normal tissues. In\u00a0vitro, we used TNF-\u03b1 to stimulate Human SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells to establish the chondrocytes injury model. Western blot analysis revealed significant expression of TRAF2 and cleaved caspase-3/8 in SW1353\u202fcells. Co-localization of TRAF2/cleaved caspase-3/8 was detected in the cells injury model by double-labeling immunofluorescent staining. We demonstrated a possible anti-apoptotic effect of TRAF2 in chondrocyte apoptosis in FJOA by knockdown of its expression with siRNA. Moreover, TRAF2 knockdown was demonstrated to enhance TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis by flow cytometry assay. In conclusion, our results show that the up-regulation of TRAF2 may play an important role in the inhibition of chondrocyte apoptosis of FJOA.",

However, the HAX1 expression and function in the spinal cord injury (SCI) pathological process have not been investigated. In our current research, the rat model of SCI was established, and then we explored the possible role of HAX1 after SCI. The results of western blot indicated that HAX1 was present in sham operated control group and significantly elevated at 3 days post SCI, then declined gradually. Immunohistochemical studies indicated HAX1 expression was enhanced significantly in white and gray matter at 3 days post SCI compared with sham operated group. Double immunofluorescence staining showed the proportion of cells, double-labeled HAX1 and neurons, astrocytes, increased significantly at 3 days post SCI. In addition, co-localization of HAX1/active caspase-3 and HAX1/PCNA was tested in cells. Furthermore, over-expression of HAX1 inhibited neuronal apoptosis in vitro, and in astrocytes HAX1 silencing could down-regulate PCNA expression post LPS treatment. Meanwhile, CCK8 assay showed that knockdown of HAX1 could inhibit the astrocyte proliferation. In summary, our data indicated that HAX1 might play significant roles in pathological process of neuronal apoptosis and astrocyte proliferation during SCI.",

        "abstract": "Traumatic spinal cord injury is a common and severe complication after an accident. As we all know that neurite outgrowth of neurons is difficult after a spinal cord injury. Endosome system is associated with cargoes transportation and contributes in promoting the neuronal capability for neurite outgrowth. EH domain-containing protein 1 (EHD1) transports proteins through the endosome system, especially in the recycling endosomes and regulating the neurite outgrowth. In mammalian cells, the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system\u00a0in endosomal sorting has been well established. Two RING \ufb01ngers and a DRIL (double RING \ufb01nger-linked) 1 (Triad1) plays an important role in membrane trafficking and its mutant results in the wrong accumulation of receptors in endosomes and plasma membrane. In this current study, we reasonably integrated the results of the above research and investigated the regulating function of Triad1 to EHD1 following the spinal cord injury. We characterized the upregulated expression and distribution of Triad1 and EHD1 in the neurons after SCI and declared the interaction between Triad1 with EHD1 both in vitro and in vivo. Triad1 regulated the interaction between itself and the full-length or EH domain of EHD1, which influenced the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Our data delineate a novel interaction between Triad1 and EHD1 that may contribute to the regulation of neurite outgrowth for neurons after the spinal cord injury.",

        "abstract": "Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play an essential role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by promoting synovitis, pannus growth and cartilage/bone destruction. Increased proliferation, migration and invasion of FLSs greatly contribute to RA initiation and progression. Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A), a serine/threonine kinase, regulates MAPK pathway activation, and governs the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells and cancer cells. Till now, the expression and possible function of Dyrk1A in RA FLSs have not been explored. In this study, we detected an increased expression of Dyrk1A both in the synovial tissues of RA patients and in a TNF-\u03b1-induced FLSs activation model. CCK-8 and Edu assays revealed that Dyrk1A knockdown inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced FLSs proliferation. Moreover, inhibiting Dyrk1A expression apparently prevented the migration and invasion capability of FLSs accompanied by a decreased MMP-3 and -9 expression. To investigate the molecular mechanism through which Dyrk1A modulates FLSs activities, we evaluated the effects of Dyrk1A on Spry2, a negativity modulator of ERK MAPK pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that Dyrk1A silencing significantly increased Spry2 expression and suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK in TNF-\u03b1-treated FLSs. Taken together, our results indicated that Dyrk1A might promote FLSs proliferation, migration and invasion by suppressing Spry2 expression and activating the ERK MAPK signaling pathway in RA.",

        "abstract": "Traumatic spinal cord injury is one of the most common and severe problems for using NGF to promote the neurite outgrowth of survival neurons. EHD1 regulates and controls the endocytosis and transportation of neurotrophins and transmembrane cargo via recycling endosome for neurite outgrowth. TrkA is particularly considered to be a functional specific recepter in the cell membrane for NGF and is activated upon NGF binding. The transcytosis of TrkA is dependent on Rab11 recycling endosomes and is promoted by NGF signaling itself at the axon terminal. In this study, we established an acute spinal cord contusion injury model in adult rats to investigate the potential role of EHD1 during the pathological process of SCI. Western blot analysis suggested that EHD1 expression was low in the sham-operated adult rat spinal cords and was significantly up-regulated 1d after injury. Immunohistochemical staining detected the general distribution of EHD1 protein in both the gray and white matter of adult rat spinal cords. Double immunofluorescent staining indicated that EHD1 was expressed in neurons, astrocytes and microglias in the adult rat spinal cord, and obvious changes of EHD1 expression occurred in neurons during SCI pathological process. Significant up-regulation of EHD1 expression was observed in MAP2 positive neurons at 1 day after SCI, in comparison with the sham-operated control, which indicated that EHD1 might play a vital role in neurite outgrowth. Our data indicated that EHD1 could interact with TrkA, and is in the upstream of TrkA. EHD1 up-regulated the expression of TrkA in the glutamate stimulated primary neurons. Based on our experimental data, we boldly conclude that EHD1 regulates the recycling of TrkA back to cell membrane, improving the utilization efficiency of the NGF, which is vital for neurite outgrowth and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.

        "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common and severe complications in spine injury. It is difficult to prevent cell necroptosis and promote the survival of residual neurons after SCI. Proteasome beta-4 subunit (PSMB4) is the first proteasomal subunit with oncogenic properties promoting cancer cell survival and tumor growth in vivo, and our previous study showed that PSMB4 is significantly associated with neuronal apoptosis in neuroinflammation. However, PSMB4 function in the necroptosis after SCI is unkown. RIP3, a key regulatory factor of necroptosis, correlates with the induction of necroptosis in various types of cells and signaling pathway. Upregulation of the RIP3 expression may play a role as a novel molecular mechanism in secondary neural tissue damage following SCI. In this study, we established an acute spinal cord contusion injury model in adult rats to investigate the potential role of PSMB4 during the pathological process of SCI. We found PSMB4 expression was significantly up-regulated 3 days after injury by western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Double immunofluorescent staining indicated obvious changes of PSMB4 expression occurred in neurons. Significant up-regulation of PSMB4 expression was observed in Rip3 positive neurons at 3 days after SCI, which indicated that PSMB4 might play a vital role in the regulation of Rip3. Overexpress and knockdown PSMB4 could intervene the RIP3 and Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) pathway in Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) induced necroptosis cell model. Based on our experimental data, we boldly conclude that PSMB4 is associated with RIP3 involved necroptosis after SCI.",

        "abstract": "Annexin A2 (ANXA2), is a member of the annexin family of proteins that exhibit Ca-dependent binding to phospholipids. One attractive biological function of ANXA2 is participating in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Previous studies have shown that ANXA2 play a role in the development of the central nervous system. However, the biological function of ANXA2 after spinal cord injury (SCI) is still with limited acquaintance. In the present study, we performed a SCI model in adult rats and investigated the dynamic changes of ANXA2 expression in the spinal cord. Western blot analysis indicated a striking expression upregulation of ANXA2 after SCI. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed that ANXA2 immunoactivity was expressed at low levels in normal condition and increased at 5day after SCI. Double immunofluorescence staining prompted that ANXA2 immunoreactivity was found in astrocytes and neurons. Interestingly, ANXA2 expression was increased predominantly in astrocytes. We also examined the expression profiles of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Cyclin D1 and active caspase-3 in the injured spinal cords by western blot. Co-expression of ANXA2/PCNA, ANXA2/Cyclin D1 was detected in glial fibrillary acidic protein. Importantly, double immunofluorescence staining revealed that cell proliferation evaluated by PCNA appeared in many ANXA2-expressing cells and rare caspase-3 was observed in ANXA2-expressing cells after SCI. In addition, ANXA2 knockdown in astrocytes resulted in the increase of PCNA expression after LPS stimulation, showing that ANXA2 inhibited astrocyte proliferation after inflammation. Our data suggested that ANXA2 might play important roles in CNS pathophysiology after SCI.",

However, the role of IGFBP6 in spinal cord injury (SCI) remains largely elusive. In this study, we have performed an acute SCI model in adult rats and investigated the dynamic changes of IGFBP6 expression in the spinal cord. Our results showed that IGFBP6 was upregulated significantly after SCI, which was paralleled with the levels of apoptotic proteins p53 and active caspase-3. Immunofluorescent labeling showed that IGFBP6 was co-localizated with active caspase-3 and p53 in neurons. To further investigate the function of IGFBP6, an apoptosis model was established in primary neuronal cells. When IGFBP6 was knocked down by specific short interfering RNA (siRNA), the protein levels of active caspase-3 and Bax as well as the number of apoptotic primary neurons were significantly decreased in our study. Taken together, our findings suggest that the change of IGFBP6 protein expression plays a key role in neuronal apoptosis after SCI.",

        "abstract": "Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) were the most widely used seed cells in the field of neural regeneration and bone tissue engineering, due to their easily isolation, lack of ethical controversy, low immunogenicity and low rates of transplantation rejection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) on neural differentiation of DPSCs in vitro. DPSCs were cultured in neural differentiation medium containing NGF and bFGF alone or combination for 7 days. Then neural genes and protein markers were analyzed using western blot and RT-PCR. Our study revealed that bFGF and NGF increased neural differentiation of DPSCs synergistically, compared with bFGF and NGF alone. The levels of Nestin, MAP-2, \u03b2III-tubulin and GFAP were the most highest in the DPSCs\u2009+\u2009bFGF\u2009+\u2009NGF group. Our results suggested that bFGF and NGF signifiantly up-regulated the levels of Sirt1. After treatment with Sirt1 inhibitor, western blot, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining showed that neural genes and protein markers had markedly decreased. Additionally, the ERK and AKT signaling pathway played a key role in the neural differentiation of DPSCs stimulated with bFGF\u2009+\u2009NGF. These results suggested that manipulation of the ERK and AKT signaling pathway may be associated with the differentiation of bFGF and NGF treated DPSCs. Our date provided theoretical basis for DPSCs to treat neurological diseases and repair neuronal damage.",

        "abstract": "Cell-based transplantation strategies hold great potential for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair. Chitosan scaffolds have therapeutic benefits for spinal cord regeneration. Human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are abundant available stem cells with low immunological incompatibility and can be considered for cell replacement therapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of chitosan scaffolds in the neural differentiation of DPSCs in vitro and to assess the supportive effects of chitosan scaffolds in an animal model of SCI. DPSCs were incubated with chitosan scaffolds. Cell viability and the secretion of neurotrophic factors were analyzed. DPSCs incubated with chitosan scaffolds were treated with neural differentiation medium for 14 days and then neural genes and protein markers were analyzed by Western blot and reverse transcription plus the polymerase chain reaction. Our study revealed a higher cell viability and neural differentiation in the DPSC/chitosan-scaffold group. Compared with the control group, the levels of BDNF, GDNF, b-NGF, and NT-3 were significantly increased in the DPSC/chitosan-scaffold group. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway played a key role in the neural differentiation of DPSCs combined with chitosan scaffolds. Transplantation of DPSCs together with chitosan scaffolds into an SCI rat model resulted in the marked recovery of hind limb locomotor functions. Thus, chitosan scaffolds were non-cytotoxic and provided a conducive and favorable microenvironment for the survival and neural differentiation of DPSCs. Transplantation of DPSCs might therefore be a suitable candidate for treating SCI and other neuronal degenerative diseases.",

        "abstract": "Aberrant functionality of the cell cycle has been implicated in the pathology of traumatic SCI. Although it has been reported that the expressions of various cell cycle related proteins were altered significantly following SCI, detailed information on the subject remains largely unclear. The embryonic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is an important metabolic kinase in aerobic glycolysis or the warburg effect, however, its functions in central nervous system (CNS) injury remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that PKM2 was not only significantly upregulated by western blot and immunohistochemistry but certain traumatic stimuli also induced translocation of PKM2 into the nucleus in astrocytes following spinal cord injury (SCI). Furthermore, the expression levels and localization of p-\u03b2-catenin, p27, cyclin D1 and PCNA were correlated with PKM2 after SCI. In vitro, we also found that PKM2 co-immunoprecipitation with p-\u03b2-catenin and p27 respectively. Knockdown of PKM2 apparently decreased the level of PCNA, cyclinD1,...",

        "abstract": "CUG-binding protein 1, a member of the CELF (CUGBP and embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like factor) family of RNA-binding proteins, is shown to be multifunctional, regulating many posttranscriptional processes including alternative splicing, deadenylation, mRNA decay, and translation. Recently, CUGBP1 is found to represses p27 IRES activity and inhibits expression of endogenous p27 in cultured breast cancer cells. However, the roles of CUGBP1 in central nervous system injury remain unknown. In our study, we performed acute spinal cord injury (SCI) model in adult rats in order to research the expression changes of CUGBP1 in spinal cord. Western blot analysis showed a marked upregulation of CUGBP1 after SCI. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a wide distribution of CUGBP1 in the spinal cord. Double immunofluorescence staining indicated that CUGBP1 immunoreactivity was increased predominantly in neurons and astrocytes after SCI. Moreover, colocalization of CUGBP1/proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was detected in GFAP positive cells. We also examined the expression profiles of p27, which was up-regulated after SCI. To further understand whether CUGBP1 plays a role in astrocyte proliferation, we applied LPS to induce astrocyte proliferation in vitro. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CUGBP1 expression was positively correlated with PCNA expression, and the p27 expression was negatively correlated with CUGBP1 expression following LPS stimulation. Our results suggest that CUGBP1 might be implicated in the pathophysiology of spinal cord after SCI.",

        "abstract": "Reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis after spinal cord injury (SCI) contribute to glial scar formation that impedes axonal regeneration. The mechanisms underlying reactive astrocyte and microglia proliferation upon injury remain partially understood. Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) is an antioxidant participating in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, PRDX1 functions in SCI-induced astrocyte and microglia proliferation are unknown. In this study, we established an acute spinal cord contusion injury model in adult rats to investigate the potential role of PRDX1 during the pathological process of SCI. We found the palpable expression increase of PRDX1 after SCI by western blot and immunohistochemistry staining. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that PRDX1 expression mainly increased in astrocytes and microglia. In addition, PRDX1/proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) colocalized in astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, PCNA expression also elevated after SCI, as well as was positively correlated with PRDX1 expression. In vitro, PRDX1 expression in primary rat spinal cord astrocytes and microglia changed in a concentration- and time-dependent manner according to LPS treatment. In addition, PRDX1 knockdown in astrocytes and microglia resulted in the decrease of PCNA expression after LPS stimulation, showing that PRDX1 promoted astrocyte and microglia proliferation after inflammation. Our results suggested that PRDX1 might play a crucial role in astrocyte and microglia proliferation after SCI. ",

Although mTOR pathway activation has been showed as responsible for IGF-1 induced pluripotent differentiation, the mechanism that the IGF-1-mTOR pathway induces the neural differentiation of DPSCs is still unclear. In our\u00a0research, we have demonstrated that 0-10\u00a0ng/mL IGF-1 had no obvious effect on the proliferation of DPSCs, but IGF-1 nonetheless enhances the neural differentiation of DPSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, we found that phosphorylated mTOR was up-regulated, which indicated the involvement of mTOR in the process. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR activity, can reverse the effect of DPSCs stimulated by IGF-1. Next, we studied the role of mTORC1 and mTORC2, two known mTOR complexes, in the neural differentiation of DPSCs. We found that inhibition of mTORC1 can severely restricts the neural differentiation of DPSCs. However, inhibition of mTORC2 has the opposite effect. This latter effect disappears when both rictor and mTOR are inhibited, showing that the mTORC2 effect is mTORC1 dependent. This study has expanded the role of mTOR in DPSCs neural differentiation regulated by IGF-1.",

        "abstract": "Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), one type of mesenchymal stem cells, are considered to be a type of tool cells for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Our previous studies found that the stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) might introduce senescence of DPSCs, and this senescence would\u00a0have a positive correlation with the concentration of LPS. The \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) staining was used to evaluate the senescence of DPSCs and immunofluorescence to show the morphology of DPSCs. Our findings suggested that the activity of SA-\u03b2-gal has increased after repeated stimulation with LPS and the morphology of DPSCs has changed with the stimulation with LPS. We also found that LPS bound\u00a0to the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor (MyD) 88 signaling pathway. Protein and mRNA expression of TLR4, MyD88 were enhanced in DPSCs with LPS stimulation, resulting in the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling, which exhibited the expression of p65 improved in the nucleus while the decreasing of I\u03baB-\u03b1. Simultaneously, the expression of p53 and p21, the downstream proteins of the NF-\u03baB signaling, has increased. In summary, DPSCs tend to undergo senescence after repeated stimulation in an inflammatory microenvironment. Ultimately, these findings may lead to a new direction for cell-based therapy in oral diseases and other regenerative medicines.",

        "abstract": "Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), as one type of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have the capability of self-renewal and multipotency to differentiate into several cell lineages, including osteogenesis, odontoblasts, chondrogenesis, neurogenesis, and adipogenesis. It has found that tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) can promote osteogenic differentiation of human DPSCs in our previous studies. Other experimentation revealed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) underwent a rapid activation both in osteogenesis and inflammation microenvironment of MSCs in vitro. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) have been proved in previous studies to regulate MSCs differentiation in vitro. In this study, we identified miR-21 as a key miRNA contributed the functional axis of odontoblast differentiation induced by STAT3. It is observed that the expression of miR-21 and STAT3 increased gradually in low concentration (1-10\u2009ng/mL) of TNF-\u03b1, while they were suppressed in high concentration (50-100\u2009ng/mL). The upregulation of miR-21 may facilitate the odontoblast differentiation of DPSCs coordinating with STAT3. SiSTAT3 or treated by the inhibitor of STAT3, cucurbitacin I (Cuc I), significantly increased primary miR-21 expression along with decreased mature miR-21 expression. Meanwhile, the inhibition of miR-21 (anti-miR-21) decreased the activation of STAT3 as well as suppressed the marker proteins of odontoblast differentiation. The results revealed a new function of miR-21, suggesting that miR-21/STAT3 signal may act as a modulator within a complex network of factors to regulate odontoblast differentiation of human DPSCs. It may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to regulate the odontoblast differentiation of DPSCs.",

JAB1 regulates several key proteins, and thereby produces varied effects on cell cycle progression, genome stability and cell survival. Some studies have shown that the loss of JAB1 in osteochondral progenitor cells severely impairs embryonic limb development in mice. However, the biological significance of JAB1 activity in the odontogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the role of JAB1, a key player in tooth development, in reparative dentin formation, especially odontogenic differentiation. We found that increased expression of JAB1 promoted odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. The role of JAB1 in the odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs was further confirmed by knocking down JAB1. Our findings provide novel insights on odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs. ",

        "abstract": "Distraction osteogenesis (DO) remains a major challenge in orthopedic and craniofacial surgery. The transplantion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could reduce the treatment period and the associated complications by increasing new bone formation during long-bone DO. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) encodes a nuclear protein that is a pivotal regulator of osteoblast differentiation. It significantly stimulates calcium accumulation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). In this study, we investigated the effects of gene therapy using Runx2 on new bone formation during tibia DO of rabbits. The distraction gap of the rabbits was injected with adenovirus (Adv)-Runx2-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected DPSCs (overexpression group, Group OE) or Adv-GFP-transfected DPSCs (negative control group, Group NC). Rabbits in the control group (Groups CON) were injected with physiologic saline. The generation of new bone tissue in the distraction gap was studied by radiographic examination, micro-computed tomography (CT) evaluation, histological analyze, and Mechanical testing at weeks 8 in the consolidation period. Excellent bone formation in the distracted callus was observed in Group OE and Group NC. Moreover, the OE group showed better bone formation and the highest bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC). Group CON animals showed inadequate bone formation in the distracted callus compared to the other groups. The results suggest that gene therapy using Runx2-modi\ufb01ed DPSCs was more effective during bone deposition and new bone formation in tibia DO.",

While as for Zr\u20131Nb\u00a0+\u00a0xBi alloys, Bi-free SPPs appear. The addition of Bi promotes the precipitation of SPPs with Sn in the alloys. The concentration of Bi dissolved in \u03b1-Zr matrix increases with the decrease in Sn content in the alloys. Adding reasonable Bi has little influence on the solid solution content of Nb in \u03b1-Zr matrix.",

The microstructure of\u00a0the oxide film\u00a0which formed was examined by TEM and SEM. The results revealed that there were a few micro-cracks and more ZrO2 columnar grains in the oxide film formed\u00a0after exposure for 190\u00a0days. The oxidation of second-phase particles (SPPs) was slower than that of \u03b1-Zr matrix. The c-ZrO2 was observed around the [Zr\u2013Nb\u2013Fe\u2013Cr\u2013Ge]O SPPs. The amorphous phase produced around the [Zr\u2013Nb\u2013Fe\u2013Cr\u2013Ge]O SPPs could relax the stress in\u00a0the oxide film. The addition of Ge can reduce micro-pores and micro-cracks formed in oxide film, and delay the microstructural evolution from columnar grains to equiaxed grains. Therefore, the addition of Ge can improve the corrosion resistance of the Zr\u20130.7Sn\u20131Nb\u20130.03Fe alloy.",

It\n is very important for electrode materials to have a wider operation temperature range. The component Al is the dominant element\n to control the electrochemical behavior of the AB5-type alloys at elevated temperature. With the increase of the amount of Al the discharge capacity decreases and the retention\n of discharge capacity increases with increasing temperature. It is mainly due to the formation of stable and dense surface\n oxide film Al2O3, which inhibits the electrode corrosion and the further oxidation underneath the surface films.",

Results show that the corrosion resistance of the Zr-0.7Sn-1Nb-0.2Fe alloy is remarkably improved with 0.05% Cu and 0.05% Ge addition, since a small amount of Cu and Ge can dissolve in \u03b1-Zr matrix and Cu- or Ge-containing Zr(Nb,Fe) 2  second phase particles(SPPs) can delay the microstructural evolution of oxide film. But the coarse tet-Zr 2 Cu and tet-Zr 3 Ge SPPs, which will be formed by the further increase of Cu and Ge content, are disadvantageous to the corrosion resistance of the alloys.",

The rolling surface (S N ) mainly suffers uniform corrosion, while the surface perpendicular to transversal direction (S T ) and the surface perpendicular to rolling direction (S R ) mainly suffer nodular corrosion. A novel mechanism of nodular corrosion related to Sn segregation at the interface between oxide and matrix (O/M) is proposed. The anisotropic nodular corrosion results from the anisotropy of Sn segregation at the O/M interfaces formed on S N , S R  and S T  surfaces with different grain orientations. Finally, some reported results about nodular corrosion in zirconium alloys are discussed.",

High reactivity of Si and high solubility of silicon oxides in high temperature water contribute to Si depletion in the outer oxide layer, Si enrichment in the inner oxide layer near the metal/oxide interface, and the outer layer of large and continuously packed oxides with cavities. A higher Cr content in the alloys favors the formation of a thinner inner oxide layer. Si in the model alloy affects the distribution of nickel oxide near the metal/oxide interface.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The iron content in Ni-Cr- x Fe ( x \u00a0=\u00a00\u20139\u00a0at.%) alloys strongly affected the properties of oxide films after 978\u00a0h of immersion in the simulated PWR primary water environment at 310\u00a0\u00b0C. Increasing the iron content in the alloys increased the amount of iron-bearing polyhedral spinel oxide particles in the outer oxide layer and increased the local oxidation penetrations into the alloy matrix from the chromium-rich inner oxide layer. The effects of iron content in the alloys on the oxide film properties after 500\u00a0h of immersion were less significant than those after 978\u00a0h. Iron content increased, and chromium content decreased, in the outer oxide layer with increasing iron content in the alloys. Increasing the immersion time facilitated the formation of the local oxidation penetrations along the matrix/film interface and the nickel-bearing spinel oxides in the outer oxide layer.",

The specimens were corroded in superheated steam at 400\u2103/10.3 MPa,and in lithiated water with 0.01 M LiOH or in deionized water at 360\u2103/18.6 MPa byautoclave testing. Results show that the corrosion resistance increases withthe increasing of Bi content dissolved in \u03b1-Zr. But the presence of Bi-con-taining second phase particles (SPPs) is unfavorable for the enhancement ofcorrosion resistance. This indicates that the Bi dissolved in \u03b1-Zr matrix playsan important role in improving the corrosion resistance, while theprecipitation of the Bi-containing SPPs does harm to the corrosion resistance.",

The MAO treatment shifted the iso-electric point (IEP) to a higher pH value in 1500 ppm B 3+  and 2.3 ppm Li +  mixed aqueous solution for simulating normal water chemistry in nuclear reactors. Besides, MAO film with higher zeta potential could reduce the adsorption of lithium ions, which improved the corrosion resistance of Zirlo alloy.",

        "abstract": "While previous dynamic lot-sizing (DLS) models mainly consider mature products, this study analyzes production planning decisions for new products. The demand dynamics caused by new product diffusion complicate production decisions for new products. We integrate DLS and discrete Bass models to provide optimal decisions for pricing and production planning problems. Moreover, we study the joint influence of product diffusion and pricing parameters on the DLS decisions. This leads to the following insights. First, coordinated production-pricing and dynamic pricing improve profitability. Second, the optimal pricing strategy is affected by market conditions. The penetration pricing strategy outperforms the skimming pricing strategy when consumers are less sensitive to relative price changes than to the introductory price, when the product diffuses slowly, or when the consumer initiative level is low. Otherwise, the latter outperforms the former. Finally, pricing strategies and product diffusion patterns reshape the cost structure of a firm. Coordinated decisions and dynamic pricing strategy substantially reduce the cost-revenue ratio, whereas an increase in the consumer initiative level or product diffusion speed can improve cost efficiency.",

Such retailer is able to obtain advance demand information (ADI) in an environment of time-varying demands. We incorporate ADI into dynamic lot-sizing models to formulate the replenishment planning problems for retailers in three scenarios: (1) companies act as pure-play online retailers with customers homogeneous in demand lead time, (2) online customers are heterogeneous in demand lead time with priorities, and (3) retailers operate in a bricks-and-clicks structure, in which demands come from online and offline channels, with either independent or interactive channels. We formulate the problem in the general scenario of interactive demand channels as a mixed-integer linear programming model, and then develop a unified model through reformulation. Based on the optimality properties, we design a dynamic programming algorithm with polynomial running time to solve the unified model. The numerical experiments for several online retailers find that the method can significantly reduce the total inventory cost.",

        "abstract": "While competitive environment analysis is critical to a global retailing operations strategy, there exist research gaps from perspectives of operational performance, retailing industrial environment, and nondiscretionary factors. Therefore, our research objective is to propose a new approach to conduct competitive environment analysis for a global operations strategy in retailing, by examining relationships between discretionary inputs of the supply chain, nondiscretionary inputs of the environment, and performance of retailing. We develop a nondiscretionary data envelopment analysis model to assess performance in retailing and integrate it with econometric analysis. Using multisource data of 124 organizations in the global retailing industry, it is interesting to find: while nondiscretionary factors significantly influence the operational performance of global retailers, firms in an environment with a higher market concentration, larger consumer spending per capita, and smaller inhabitants\u2019 population are more likely to achieve a higher operational efficiency in retailing. Another interesting finding with practical implication is: inputs relevant to outside environment (e.g., suppliers in upstream and outlets in downstream supply chain) can influence operational efficiency more than inputs in internal supply chain (e.g., warehouses).",

Using a sample of 124 organizations in the retailing industry, this paper found three configurations of supply chain integration with strategic fit to operational competencies for superior business performance. Case studies based on 56 organizations in three configurations were conducted to provide additional insights for strategic fit and we utilized multiple discriminant analysis to assess the validity of three configurations. We provide a new framework for theoretical advances in the supply chain integration field and help practitioners make decisions for strategic-fit supply chains across multiple departments.",

In many real-world situations such as evaluating sustainable design performances, however, information about the leader (dominant) stage is often unavailable as a firm\u05f3s internal decision process may not be observable for outsiders. In the current study, we extend the work by Despotis, Sotiros and Koronakos (2016) [9] to generate a Pareto solution and identify the leader stage. We show that the optimal solution for the extended model is also a leader-follower solution and that the global optimal solution can be identified by comparing the efficiency score difference for the upper and lower bounds of the two stages. We also perform empirical tests with data from the insurance industry and automobile industry to demonstrate the applications of the proposed model in identifying the leader stage in two-stage DEA. It is shown that, in the absence of a priori knowledge, our analytical results can be used to uncover the dominant decision stage in a two-stage decision making process with interesting implications in performance evaluation in the two selected industries.",

A series of substituted pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxaline derivatives were constructed readily in yields of 53\u201393% from the cheap primary alcohols by using dioxygen as the terminal oxidant. Remarkably, the fact that no extra metals and additives were necessary makes this unprecedented aerobic oxidation process highly step- and atom-economical.

Importantly, the reaction proceeded well without any additives and no waste was produced, affording linear products with high regioselectivities (>20\u2009:\u20091). Enantioselective allylic alkylation has also been realized to provide the desired products in good yields and 35% ee.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014   18 F-sodium fluoride ( 18 F-NaF) positron-emission tomography has been introduced as a potential noninvasive imaging tool to identify plaques with high-risk characteristics in patients with coronary artery disease. We sought to evaluate the clinical relevance of  18 F-NaF uptake using optical coherence tomography (OCT), intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and coronary computed tomography angiography in patients with coronary artery disease.  Methods and Results\u2014  The target population consisted of 51 prospectively enrolled patients (93 stenoses) who underwent  18 F-NaF positron-emission tomography before invasive coronary angiography.  18 F-NaF uptake was compared with IVUS- and OCT-derived plaque characteristics. In the coronary computed tomography angiography subgroup (46 lesions), qualitative lesion characteristics were compared between  18 F-NaF\u2013positive and  18 F-NaF\u2013negative plaques using adverse plaque characteristics. The plaques with  18 F-NaF uptake showed significantly higher plaque burden, more frequent posterior attenuation and positive remodeling in IVUS, and significantly higher maximum lipid arc and more frequent microvessels in OCT (all  P  18 F-NaF\u2013positive and  18 F-NaF\u2013negative lesions. Among 51 lesions with  18 F-NaF\u2013positive uptake, 48 lesions (94.1%) had at least one of high-risk characteristics. The  18 F-NaF tissue-to-background ratio in plaques with high-risk characteristics was significantly higher than in those without (1.09 [95% confidence interval, 0.85\u20131.34] versus 0.62 [95% confidence interval, 0.42\u20130.82],  P  P =0.014 for OCT definition). Among the 15 lesions that met both IVUS- and OCT-defined criteria for high-risk plaque, 14 (93.3%) showed  18 F-NaF\u2013positive uptake. There was no difference in the prevalence of plaques with any adverse plaque characteristics between  18 F-NaF\u2013positive and  18 F-NaF\u2013negative plaques in the coronary computed tomography angiography subgroup (85.2% versus 78.9%;  P =0.583).

        "abstract": "Background Total atherosclerosis disease burden is associated with clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease. However, the influence of sex on the relationship between total anatomical and physiologic disease burdens and their prognostic implications have not been well defined. Methods and Results A total of 1136 patients who underwent fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement in all 3 major coronary arteries were included in this study. Anatomical and physiologic total disease burden was assessed by SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score, residual SYNTAX score, a total sum of FFR in 3 vessels (3-vessel FFR), and functional SYNTAX score. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven revascularization at 2\u00a0years. There were no differences in angiographic diameter stenosis, SYNTAX score, or residual SYNTAX score between women and men. However, both per-vessel FFR (0.89\u00b10.10 versus 0.87\u00b10.11, P<0.001) and 3-vessel FFR (2.72\u00b10.13 versus 2.69\u00b10.15, P<0.001) were higher in women. Multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that total anatomical and physiologic disease burdens were significantly associated with 2-year major adverse cardiac events, and there was no significant interaction between sex and total disease burden for clinical outcomes. Conclusions Despite similar angiographic disease severity, both per-vessel and per-patient physiologic disease severity was less in women than in men. There was no influence of sex on prognostic implications of total anatomical and physiologic disease burdens in patients with coronary artery disease.

        "abstract": " A long-standing task for ecologists and biogeographers is to reveal the underlying mechanisms accounting for the geographic pattern of species diversity. The number of hypotheses to explain geographic variation in species diversity has increased dramatically during the past half century. The oldest and the most popular one is environmental determination. However, seasonality, the intra-annual variability in climate variables has been rarely related to species richness. In this study, we assessed the relative importance of three environmental hypotheses: energy, seasonality and heterogeneity in explaining species richness pattern of butterflies in Eastern China. In addition, we also examined how environmental variables affect the relationship between species richness of butterflies and seed plants at geographic scale. All the environmental factors significantly affected butterfly richness, except sampling area and coefficient of variation of mean monthly precipitation. Energy and seasonality hypotheses explained comparable variation in butterfly richness (42.3 vs. 39.3\u00a0%), higher than that of heterogeneity hypothesis (25.9\u00a0%). Variation partitioning indicated that the independent effect of seasonality was much lower (0.0\u00a0%) than that of energy (5.5\u00a0%) and heterogeneity (6.3\u00a0%). However, seasonality performed better in explaining butterfly richness in topographically complex areas, reducing spatial autocorrelation in butterfly richness, and more strongly affect the association between butterflies and seed plants. The positive relationship between seed plant richness and butterfly richness was most likely the result of environmental variables (especially seasonality) influencing them in parallel. Insufficient sampling may partly explain the low explanatory power of environmental model (52.1\u00a0%) for geographic butterfly richness pattern. Our results have important implications for predicting the response of butterfly diversity to climate change.",

        "abstract": "Biogeographical regionalization schemes have traditionally been constructed based on taxonomic endemism of families, genera, and/or species, and rarely incorporated the phylogenetic relationships between taxa. However, phylogenetic relationships are important for understanding historical connections within and among biogeographical regions. Phylogeny-based delineation of biota is a burgeoning and fruitful field that is expected to provide novel insights into the conservation of regional diversity and the evolutionary history of biota. Using the Chinese flora as an example, we compared regionalization schemes that were based on: 1) taxonomic endemism, 2) taxonomic dissimilarity, and 3) phylogenetic dissimilarity. Our results revealed general consistency among different regionalization schemes and demonstrated that the phylogenetic dissimilarity approach is preferable for biogeographical regionalization studies. Using the phylogenetic dissimilarity approach, we identified five phytogeographical regions within China: the Paleotropic, Holarctic, East Asiatic, Tethyan, and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Regions. The relationship of these regions was inferred to be: (Paleotropic, ((East Asiatic + Holarctic) + (Tethyan + Qinghai-Tibet Plateau)).",

        "abstract": "Actin motor myosin proteins are the driving forces behind the active transport of vesicles, and more than 20 classes of myosin have been found to contribute to a wide range of cellular processes, including endocytosis and exocytosis, autophagy, cytokinesis and the actin cytoskeleton. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, class V myosin Myo2 (ScMyo2p) is important for the transport of distinct sets of cargo to regions of the cell along the cytoskeleton for polarized growth. To study whether myosins play a role in the formation or function of the appressorium (infectious structure) of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, we identified MoMyo5 as an orthologue of ScMyo2p and characterized its function. Targeted gene disruption revealed that MoMyo5 is required for intracellular transport and is essential for hyphal growth and asexual reproduction. Although the \u0394Momyo5 mutant could form appressorium-like structures, the structures were unable to penetrate host cells and were therefore non-pathogenic. We further found that MoMyo5 moves dynamically from the cytoplasm to the hyphal tip, where it interacts with MoSec4, a Rab GTPase involved in secretory transport, hyphal growth and fungal pathogenicity. Our studies indicate that class V myosin and its translocation are tightly coupled with hyphal growth, asexual reproduction, appressorium function and pathogenicity in the rice blast fungus.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Adipose tissue inflammation has been linked to metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the molecules that mediate inflammation in adipose tissue have not been addressed. Although retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (ROR\u03b1) is known to be involved in the regulation of inflammatory response in some tissues, its role is largely unknown in adipose tissue. Conversely, it is known that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolding protein response (UPR) signaling affect the inflammatory response in obese adipose tissue, but whether ROR\u03b1 regulates these processes remains unknown. In this study, we investigate the link between ROR\u03b1 and adipose tissue inflammation. We showed that the inflammatory response in macrophages or 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharide as well as adipose tissue in obese mice markedly increased the expression of ROR\u03b1. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ROR\u03b1 or treatment with the ROR\u03b1-specific agonist SR1078 enhanced the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and increased the number of infiltrated macrophages into adipose tissue. Furthermore, SR1078 up-regulated the mRNA expression of ER stress response genes and enhanced phosphorylations of two of the three mediators of major UPR signaling pathways, PERK and IRE1\u03b1. Finally, we found that alleviation of ER stress using a chemical chaperone followed by the suppression of ROR\u03b1-induced inflammation in adipose tissue. Our data suggests that ROR\u03b1-induced ER stress response potentially contributes to the adipose tissue inflammation that can be mitigated by treatment with chemical chaperones. The relationships established here between ROR\u03b1 expression, inflammation and UPR signaling may have implications for therapeutic targeting of obesity-related metabolic diseases.",

However, drug-loading capacities and therapeutic effects of self-assembled magnetic core/shell nanocarriers with magnetic nanoparticles in the core are limited by the intervention of the outer organic or inorganic shell, the aggregation of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, the narrowed inner cavity, etc. Here, we present a self-assembly approach based on rebalancing hydrogen bonds between components under a supercooling process to form a new core/shell nanoscale supraparticle with magnetic nanoparticles as the shell and a polysaccharide as a core. Compared with conventional iron oxide nanoparticles, this magnetic shelled core/shell nanoparticle possesses an optimized inner cavity and a loss-free outer magnetic property. Furthermore, we find that the drug-loaded magnetic shelled nanocarriers showed interesting in vitro release behaviors at different pH conditions, including \"swelling-broken\", \"dissociating-broken\", and \"bursting-broken\" modes. Our experiments demonstrate the novel design of the multifunctional hybrid nanostructure and provide a considerable potential for the biomedical applications. ",

        "abstract": "Preparation of nanoscale Janus particles that can respond to external stimulation and, at the same time, be prepared using an easily achievable method presents a significant challenge. Here, we have demonstrated the shape memory of Janus nanoparticles (SMJNPs) with a multifunctional combination of Janus nanostructure and a shape memory effect, composed of a well-defined amphipathic sucrose-poly(e-caprolactone) cross-linked network. A sudden negative pressure method was first used to prepare the Janus-shaped nanoparticles (temporary shape), which can switch their shape and wettability. The Janus-shaped nanoparticle is an amphipathic structure composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. Moreover, in response to temperature, the nanoparticle can recover their nanosphere state via a shape memory process. The novel Janus nanoparticles with the shape memory property also show a great potential for application such as drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an active islanding detection method based on injecting adaptive active current disturbance according to the amplitude of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) detected after islanding occurred to reduce the disturbance on the inverter's output current. According to the amplitude of the voltage of PCC detected after islanding, the resistance value of the load can be obtained. Then the relationship between the minimum active disturbance current which can trigger islanding protection and the amplitude of PCC voltage is deduced. The required active disturbance current can be adaptively added to the inverter according to the amplitude of PCC voltage. As a result, the islanding can be detected after power failure without non-detection zone (NDZ). According to IEEE Std.1547.1 and IEEE Std.929-2000, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is correct and effective. The experiment results also show that compared to the constant and periodic disturbance methods, the disturbance on the inverter's output current is significantly reduced by using the proposed adaptive active current disturbance algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   With the research object of LiFePO 4  battery, this paper aims to correctly estimate the battery state of charge (SOC) by constructing a comprehensive SOC estimation strategy. Firstly, recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is adopted to realize online parameter identification of the equivalent battery model; and then an elaborate combination of RLS and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is established, thus the battery model parameters used in UKF are actually obtained recursively by RLS; finally, SOC can be estimated by UKF. This strategy has an obvious adaptability due to the adoption of online parameter identification, so it is also called adaptive SOC estimation technique. Experimental results show that sometimes battery model parameters of different cells can be much different even though terminal voltages of these cells are very close or same when they are under resting state, and this inconsistency among LiFePO 4  batteries is captured by the RLS-UKF strategy presented in this paper; and of course battery SOC can also be correctly estimated by using the continuously updated model parameters.",

The rheology behavior of CNF/GNP-OWC slurries at three temperatures (i.e., 20, 40, and 60\u00a0\u00b0C) was measured and modeled using four different rheological models. Thermal properties, surface functional groups, morphology, and mechanical performance of the composites were characterized. CNF/GNP-OWC slurry exhibited a typical shear-thinning behavior with reduced shear viscosity at higher shear rates. The use of CNFs and GNPs led to increased yield stresses of fresh CNF/GNP-OWC slurry and temperature significantly influenced the yield stress values. Among these rheology models, the Vom Berg model exhibits the best fitting result of the slurry rheology data (R 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.999). The addition of CNFs and GNPs increased degree of hydration (DOH) value of CNF/GNP-OWC composites. Both flexural and compressive strengths of the CNF/GNP-OWC composites were enhanced with added CNFs and GNPs. The reinforcing mechanism was attributed to the increased DOH, reduced pores, and bridging effect of CNFs and GNPs in the composites.",

The addition of FMs lowered the composite strength, but composite modulus did not change in a systematic manner. The fiber-polymer interfacial adhesion became increasingly deteriorated with the FM addition, and the use of MAPE coupling agent in the composites helped improve the interfacial adhesion.

        "abstract": "A novel thermoresponsive copolymer poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) grafted cellulose nanocrystals (PVCL-g-CNCs) was synthesized using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization, and its temperature responsive behavior was studied in this work. The chemical structure characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of covalently grafting PVCL chains on the CNC surface. The crystalline structure and nanorod-shaped morphology of CNCs were well preserved after polymerization. Transmission electron microscope results indicated that the surface of CNCs was covered with grafted PVCL brushes. The viscoelastic properties of PVCL-g-CNC aqueous suspensions (1.0 wt %) by dynamic rheology measurements confirmed the thermally induced phase transition behavior. The work presented herein paves the way to design CNC-based advanced functional materials benefiting both from the intrinsic characteristics of C...",

        "abstract": "The interest in the modification of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) lies in its potential to homogenously disperse CNCs in hydrophobic polymer matrices and to promote interfacial adhesion. In this work, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as well as poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) was grafted onto CNCs, thereby imparting their hydrophobic traits. The successful grafting modification led to the increased thermal stability of modified CNCs (MCNCs), and the hydrophobic surface modification was integrated with crystalline structure and morphology of CNCs. The nanocomposites with 7\u202fwt% MCNCs/PBA-co-PMMA had an increase in Young's modulus of >25-fold and in tensile strength at about 3 times compared to these of neat PBA-co-PMMA copolymer. In addition, a micro-phase separated morphology (PBA- soft domains, and PMMA- as well as CNCs- hard domains) of MCNCs/PBA-co-PMMA nanocomposites was observed. The large increase in the storage moduli (glass transition temperatures) and organized morphology of MCNCs/PBA-co-PMMA nanocomposites also elucidated the relationship between the mechanical properties and the micro-phase separated morphology. Therefore, the modified MCNCs are effective reinforcing agents for the PBA-co-PMMA thermoplastic elastomers, opening up opportunities for their wide-spread applications in polymer composites.",

        "abstract": "A series of HSCO dual-donors [Mn(CO)CSNRR] was synthesized, and evaluated from toxicity and bioactivity. The COHS measuring test showed all the complexes not only released CO, but released HS. The resulting data of cytotoxicity showed all the complexes had activities against the cell proliferation; among them, complexes 1, 2 and 7 displayed higher activities than the others, and their potencies were close to cis-platinum (DDP); whereas the precursors A-A had almost no activities against all five tumor cell lines and W138\u202fcell line proliferation. It is worth noting that complex 1 displayed the highest activity to MCF-7, complex 2 displayed the highest activity to HePG2, and complex 7 showed selectivity inhibition to both A549 and HeLa. The developmental toxicities of the complex were assessed using zebrafish embryos. The results showed complexes 1 and 2 had effect on the mortality and hatching rate of zebrafish embryos in dose-dependent manner. They caused zebrafish malformations when they were over 10\u202f\u03bcM. Meanwhile, they displayed dose-dependent toxicities to larval zebrafish. In the test of bio-activities, complexes 1 and 2 had strong anti-inflammatory activities; they not only down-regulated the expression levels of iNOS and TNF-\u03b1, up-regulated the expression of HO-1 and IL-10, but also up-regulated COX-2 levels. In contrast, the precursor compound (A or A) displayed lower anti-inflammatory activity than the corresponding complex, which suggests both the CO and HS from the complex took synergistic effects in the process of anti-inflammation. In addition, the complex showed antihypertensive effect and myocardial protection. This effect also possibly resulted from this synergistic effect. All these suggest the complexes have potential to be candidate medicines.",

On the basis of the specific recognition of galactose or sialic acid by a receptor, a series of CORMs based on carbohydrates were synthesized and evaluated. The test results show that all the complexes displayed anticancer activity. Among them, the effects of the complexes of galactose (1), GalNAc (8) and sialic acid (10) were very distinct. Complex 1 displayed higher activity against HeLa, HePG2, MCF-7 and HT-29 cell proliferation than cis-platin (DDP), and its selectivity was far much better than DDP compared with normal cell W138. Furthermore, the uptakes of complexes 1, 8 and 10 by HePG2, HT-29, A549 and RAW264.7 cell lines were studied. The uptake ratio of each cell line for complex 1 was different, and the order of uptake ratio in the four cell lines was HePG2 > HT-29 > RAW264.7 > A549. The HePG2 cells absorbed complex 1 beyond 60% after incubation for 8 h, while A549 absorbed only 27.8%. For complex 8, the uptake trend was similar to that of complex 1 with it being absorbed by all the four cancer cells, but the uptake rate was lower. However, differently, complex 10 was absorbed heavily by macrophage RAW264.7, followed by HePG2; after 8 h incubation, the uptake ratio of RAW264.7 was over 50%. In addition, the mechanism of action was explored, and the results showed that the complexes inhibited cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase; complex 1 up-regulated the expression levels of caspase-3 and Bax, and down-regulated the Bcl-2 expression, giving rise to HePG2 cell apoptosis.",

The crystal structures of complexes  9 ,  11 ,  14  and  16  were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, the anti-tumor activity, protection on oxidative damage of H9c2 cells, anti-hypertension and myocardial protective effects were evaluated. The results showed only a part of the complexes had anticancer activity for the five cell lines compared with 5-FU. Among them, complexes  12  and  13  which modified by selective COX-2 inhibitors displayed strong antiproliferative activity and selectivity to MCF-7\u202fcell and HT-29\u202fcell lines, and their IC 50  values were 33.6\u201355.8\u202f\u03bcM; but compared with cis-platin (DDP), they showed slightly lower activities. The complex inhibited the expression of COX-2 in HT-29\u202fcells and MCF-7\u202fcells, and complex  12  had stronger inhibitory effects than the others, which was accordance with its stronger activity against cell proliferation. Secondly, the complex improved the survival rate of H9c2 cells injured by H 2 O 2 . For each tested complex, the survival rate increased obviously after the cells treated with H 2 O 2  for 1h; but it increased slowly when the cells harmed for 8h due to the severe cell injury. In addition, the complexes displayed antihypertensive effects on spontaneously hypertensive rats, accompanying with good myocardium protection. This indicates these hybrid CORMs reduced myocardial toxicity of COX-2 inhibitors like, but there still has liver and kidney side-effects when administrating continuously for 14 days.",

The test results showed that after the successive administration of the compound for 14 days, the number of white blood cells in the blood of rats reduced, and protein and leukocytes appeared in urine; further, \u03b1-lipoic-acid-acetaminophen ester () and ibuprofen-ADTOH ester () had a certain effect on the physiological tissue and function of rat liver, and their side-effects on the kidneys were obvious. However, when compared with NSAIDs as the precursors, the tested compounds displayed much fewer side-effects; particularly, for the gastrointestinal mucosa of rats, there were hardly any side-effects. Moreover, all the three compounds decreased blood pressures in spontaneously hypertensive rats in a concentration-dependent manner, even though this antihypertensive effect was weaker than those induced by nifedipine and captopril. In addition, three compounds protected H9c2 cells from injury  an antioxidation pathway; and they improved myocardial injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Compound  is the derivative of ibuprofen and has lower toxicity to rat cardiomyocytes than ibuprofen. Therefore, it may become a better substitute of ibuprofen in patients due to its lower cardiotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "HS donors are substitutes of HS with various biological activities like inhibiting the inflammatory response and protecting myocardial cells from injury. In order to confirm whether the HS donors have drug-like properties, two series thiophosphamide HS donors were evaluated including toxicity, bioactivity and pharmacokinetic properties in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. The following results were obtained. Firstly, all the compounds released HS under measuring condition; with the increase of pH value, the HS release rate of all the compounds decreased and the amount reduced, but pH value had little effect on the maximum release of HS. Secondly, in the organs and tissues of rats, the compounds released HS in the same way as in PBS. In plasma, compound 1 reached the C after administration 55\u202fmin, and no compound 1 was detected after 12\u202fh; for compound 18, the C reached only after administration 100\u202fmin, and after 6\u202fh, compound 18 was not detected; in organs and tissues, the HS-release rates were different from those in PBS, but the mechanism of HS release was the same. Thirdly, in the test of toxicity, all the compounds displayed low toxicities to 5 cancer cells and W138\u202fcell lines; compounds 1 and 18 had slight effect on the physiological tissue and function of rat liver at low concentration; the compounds had almost no effect on the hatching rate, survival rate of zebrafish embryos, and the spontaneous movement of zebrafish embryos at below 0.5\u202f\u03bcM, but when they were over 1\u202f\u03bcM, the compounds displayed inhibitory effect in the manner of concentration dependence. Fourthly, in the course of anti-inflammatory test, all the tested compounds significantly reduced the level of TNF-\u03b1 and increased the level of IL-10; when they were 100\u202f\u03bcM, the levels of IL-10 were three times as high as those in the control group. Among them, compounds 10 and 18 displayed stronger activities than the others. In addition, the compounds protected H9c2 cells from injure and improved myocardial injury through anti-oxidation pathway. In summary, the compounds have druglike properties due to low toxicity, better activity and good pharmacokinetic property. Therefore, they have potential to be as candidates to investigate further.",

        "abstract": "Based on the structures of nicotinic acid and chlorfibrate, a series of new HS donors were synthesized and their anti-atherosclerosis activities using Ox-LDL RAW 264.6 cells as model were evaluated. The release test showed that all the compounds could release HS effectively and showed low cytotoxicity. In the bioactivity experiments, compounds 1, 3, 9 and 14 increased the survival rate of HUVEC cells treated by ox-LDL; among four compounds, compounds 1 and 3 displayed higher activity than the others. In the foam cell model, compounds 1 and 3 were found to inhibit the formation of foam cells and significantly reduced the content of TC and FC in foam cells. They had more obvious effects on lipid reduction than those of nicotinic acid and chlorfibrate. In anti-oxidation, compounds 1 and 3 significantly reduced ROS and MDA and increased the expression level of SOD, whereas the precursor compounds, niacin and chlorfibrate had little antioxidant effect. In addition, both compounds also inhibited the inflammatory response in foam cells, with reducing pro-inflammatory factor TNF-\u03b1 and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. WB assay showed that the tested compounds inhibited the expression levels PI3K, Akt and NF-\u03bab proteins. In conclusion, the compounds as HS donors could protect HUVEC cells from damage and inhibit the formation of foam cells by inhibiting PI3K/Akt/NF-\u03bab signal pathway. All these suggest the compounds have potential to be candidate for anti-atherosclerosis medicines.",

        "abstract": "The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) is viewed as an ideal target for hepatocyte-specific delivery. And the galactose residue is a promising ASGP-R ligand because of its high receptor affinity. Herein, a novel polymer based on PEGylated galactose was developed to achieve boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for active targeting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by loading carborane clusters. Notably, the polymer could self-assemble into micelles with an average diameter of 135\u202fnm under physiological conditions. The micelle had the high selectivity and low cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells (IC >1000\u202f\u03bcM). Kinetically, the micelle had the higher uptake in HepG2 cells than the positive control group sodium borocaptate (BSH) in vitro. After the HepG2 cells were treated with the micelle, the cytoskeleton was changed and the migration ability was weakened during BNCT. Apoptosis was remarkably induced by breaking of DNA double strands of cancer cells. In addition, the concentration of B in the tumor was 4.5 times higher than that of the BSH group at 4\u202fh after the micelle administration in the tumor-bearing mice. The tumor/blood ratio of B concentration reached over 25 at 24\u202fh after micelle injection. In the normal mice, the micelles were mainly distributed among the liver and kidney tissues and could be effectively eliminated from the body within 24\u202fh. No systemic toxicity was observed after administration. Thus, the carborane-containing PEGylated galactose micelles with ASGP-R targeting can be used as a promising therapeutic vector for effective boron neutron capture therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The flora in China is highly endemic. Decisions about conservation and management of biodiversity based on hotspots and conservation gaps of endemic seed plant species diversity in China are essential. In this paper, based on a species distribution data set with 12,824 Chinese endemic plants, we measured Chinese endemic seed plant diversity using five indices: endemic species richness (ER), weighted endemism (WE), phylogenetic diversity (PD), phylogenetic endemism (PE), and biogeographically weighted evolutionary distinctiveness (BED). Five percent of Chinau0027s total land area with the highest biodiversity was used to identify hotspots for each index. In total, 19 hotspots covering 7.96% of Chinau0027s total land area were identified. Most hotspots are located in mountainous areas, mainly in the Qinling Mountains and further south or in the Hengduan Mountains and to the east in China. Nine hotspots are identified with all five indices. These hotspots include the Hengduan Mountains, the Xishuangbanna Region, the Qinling Mountains, southwest Chongqing, and five mountainous areas (located in east Chongqing and west Hubei; in east Yunnan and west Guangxi; in north Guangxi, southeast Guizhou and southwest Hunan; in north Guangdong and south Hunan; and in southeast Tibet, respectively). Furthermore, we detected conservation gaps for hotspots of Chinese endemic seed flora by overlaying national nature reserves with the identified hotspots, and we designated priority conservation gaps for hotspots by overlaying global biodiversity hotspots with conservation gaps for hotspots. Most hotspots for Chinese endemic seed plant species are badly protected. Only 26.48% of the hotspot areas of Chinese endemic seed plant species were covered by nature reserves. We suggest that it is essential to pay more attention to herbaceous plants in biodiversity conservation, and to promote a network function of nature reserves within these hotspots in China.",

        "abstract": "Summary 1. Plant ecologists have been rather slow to appreciate the existence and the effects of imperfect detection probability in plants. Sources of heterogeneous detectability include differences in mor- phology or life-form, patch size, observers and survey effort. Understanding the relationship between such factors and detectability is crucial for the efficient design of new plant distribution studies and for the interpretation of existing ones. 2. We have studied the factors affecting detectability in a large permanent plot (24 ha) in East China where the true distribution of six shrub and tree species was known from a detailed earlier inventory. Two observers independently resurveyed and recorded detection and non-detection of each species in each 20 \u00b7 20 m sampling quadrat. A total of 288 quadrats were resurveyed (218 by observer A, 211 by observer B and 141 by both). We used generalized linear mixed modelling to study the relationships between detection and species, observer, survey effort and patch size. 3. Detectability of an occupied quadrat was remarkably low and ranged from 0.09 to 0.34 on aver- age for the six shrub and tree species. Differences of detection among species were mainly as a result of distinctive morphology rather than life-form. There was no significant difference of overall detec- tion probability between the two observers. Detectability increased to 0.95 as the survey path approached 20% area of the sampling quadrat and as a plant patch covered c. 19% of the area of the sampling quadrat. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that imperfect detection is much more widespread than currently acknowledged by most plant ecologists. We identify several sources of heterogeneity in detectability (species, survey effort and patch size) that ought to be considered when studying and modelling the distribution of plant species. Detectability should be accounted for in plant distribution studies to avoid spurious inferences.",

Little is known of the genetic diversity and phylogenetic characteristics of L. interrogans within China. To better understand the transmission and genetic diversity of L. interrogans populations, we characterized 271 isolates and seven vaccine strains from China during 1954-2014 using multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). 110 different L. interrogans MLVA profiles (MTs) were identified, of which five were predominant, reflecting a high level of genetic diversity in L. interrogans population in China. Different from that of circulating isolates, seven vaccine strains have different MT, of which some are phylogenetically away from the circulating isolates. The results showed that Icterohaemorrhagiae, Hebdomadis, and Canicola ranked as the top three serogroups among L. interrogans strains tested. The cluster analysis demonstrate the clonal links between rodent and human isolates, suggesting the rodent species played a key role in the transmission of leptospirosis to humans, and contributed to the circulation of the pathogen in humans. Taken together, these findings should provide insight into a better knowledge of the epidemiology and molecular evolution of L. interrogans in China. Furthermore, the results should facilitate the selection of candidate vaccine strains in the future.",

Genome sequencing analysis revealed the draft genome of 4.2 M bp with a G+C content of 40.67% for strain L231, and a total of 4,794 ORFs were identified. The strain L231 genome was found to have a larger LPS biosynthesis locus than that of strains  serovar Lai and  serovar Hardjobovis. Phylogenomic reconstructions showed that the evolutionary position of  serovar Heyan was different from that of other serovars from serogroup Manhao.

In this study, multiple approaches were used to characterize the recently discovered serovar Heyan strain L231. This strain can infect guinea pigs and belonged to the pathogenic species L. weilii. Genome sequencing analysis revealed the draft genome of 4.2 M bp with a G+C content of 40.67% for strain L231, and a total of 4,794 ORFs were identified. The strain L231 genome was found to have a larger LPS biosynthesis locus than that of strains L. interrogans serovar Lai and L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjobovis. Phylogenomic reconstructions showed that the evolutionary position of L. weilii serovar Heyan was different from that of other serovars from serogroup Manhao. These findings may lead us to a better understanding of Leptospira pathogenesis and evolution.",

A broad emission band peaking at ~448\u00a0nm upon excitation at 262 and 308\u00a0nm was observed in the range 330-680\u00a0nm at room temperature due to  P \u00a0\u2192\u00a0 S transition of the Bi ion. The chromaticity coordinate was (0.1786, 0.1665). The optimal Bi ion concentration was ~0.6\u00a0mol% in CaSnO :Bi phosphor. The emission spectrum of CaSnO :Bi phosphor showed a blue-shift with increasing temperature from 50 to 300\u00a0K due to the influence of temperature on the electron transition of the Bi ion. The emission intensity of CaSnO :Bi phosphor may be increased ~1.45 times by co-doping Li ions as a charge compensator and fluxing agent. The luminescence mechanism is explained by a configurational coordinate diagram of Bi ion in CaSnO :Bi phosphor.",

Sr 2 Mg 3 P 4 O 15 :Bi 3+  phosphor with excitation 380\u202fnm shows blue light and its emission band peaking at \u223c445\u202fnm is observed. Under excitation at 355 and 416\u202fnm, Sr 2 Mg 3 P 4 O 15 :Mn 2+  phosphor shows red emission with a single broad emission band peaking at \u223c630\u202fnm in the range of 500\u2013800\u202fnm owing to the  4 T 1 (G) \u2192  6 A 1  transition of the Mn 2+  ion. The optimal Mn 2+  ion content in Sr 2 Mg 3 P 4 O 15 :Mn 2+  phosphor is \u223c0.05 and the lifetime of Sr 2 Mg 2.95 P 4 O 15 :0.05Mn 2+  phosphor is \u223c6.17\u202fms. After Bi 3+  ion is co-doped, emission intensity of Sr 2 Mg 3 P 4 O 15 :Mn 2+  phosphor can be enhanced obviously due to energy transfer (ET) from Bi 3+  to Mn 2+ , which is confirmed by the luminescence properties and lifetimes of Sr 2 Mg 3-x P 4 O 15 :Bi 3+ , Mn 2+  phosphor. Luminous mechanism and ET process of Sr 2 Mg 3-x P 4 O 15 :Bi 3+ , Mn 2+  phosphor are explained by the simple energy level diagram of Bi 3+  and Mn 2+  ions.",

The complex hybrid underwent a sol-gel phase transition above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the A block. DyW10 was electrostatically encapsulated into the hydrophobic domain of the A block with enhanced photoluminescence. When temperature cooled down, the luminescence could be restored. By addition of acids to protonate the A block, and emission of DyW10 was simultaneously enhanced. Sensitivity of poly(N,N-dimethy laminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) to pH also enabled the emission of DyW10/copolymer hydrogel to be reversibly switched by alternating acid/base treatments.",

The copolymer synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) undergoes irreversible cleavage upon UV irradiation to generate primary amine (pKa \u2248 8-9) residues which are completely protonated under a neutral pH in aqueous solution. Electrostatic attractions between the resulting positively charged copolymers and anionic LnW drive the formation of assemblies. In situ small angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy are used to characterize the morphology of the assemblies. The microenvironments around polyoxometalates in the core of hybrid assemblies become highly hydrophobic, resulting in dramatically enhanced photoluminescence with the obvious intensity enhancement. The solution parameters pH and salt additives show great effects on the formation of assemblies.",

By taking advantage of the CO2 sensitivity of PDMAEMA blocks to protonate the neutral tertiary amino groups, CO2 can induce the electrostatic coassembly of anionic DyW10 with protonated PDMAEMA blocks, and consequently trigger the luminescence chromism of DyW10 due to the change in the microenvironment of Dy(3+). The hybrid complex in dilute aqueous solution is very sensitive to CO2 content and shows rapid responsiveness in luminescence. The luminescence intensity of the DyW10/PEO-b-PDMAEMA complex increases linearly with an increasing amount of dissolved CO2, which permits the qualitative and quantitative detection of CO2. The complex solution also shows good selectivity for CO2, with good interference tolerance of CO, N2, HCl, H2O and SO2. The supramolecular chemosensor can be recycled through disassembly of the hybrid complex by simply purging with inert gases to remove CO2.",

        "abstract": "Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles    Control of Braking and  Subsystems for Autonomous Vehicle based on an Efficient Yaw Moment   by Shaobo Lu, Sheng Cen, Xiaosong Hu, Cheewah Lim and Jinlong Zhang,  in the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Early Access, May 2017   After careful and considered review of the content and authorship of this paper by a duly constituted expert committee, this paper has been found to be in violation of IEEE\u2019s Publication Principles.   This paper copies equations from the paper(s) cited below. The content was copied without attribution (including appropriate references to the original author(s) and/or paper title) and without permission. The lead and the second author of the paper were responsible for the violation. A correction letter for this misconduct was submitted and published at http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017449   Coordinated Control with Electronic Stability Control and Active Front  Using the Optimum Yaw Moment Distribution Under a Lateral Force Constraint on the Active Front Steering  by Seongjin Yim, Seungjun Kim and Heesung Yun,  in the Proceedings of Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering, 2016, Vol. 230(5) pp. 581-592   This paper presents an Integrated Chassis Control (ICC) strategy for Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Active Four Wheel  (AFWS) based on an efficient optimal yaw moment distribution. To further enhance the handling and lateral stability of vehicle equipped with ESC, a new Weighted Pseudo- inverse Control Allocation (WPCA) based ICC is proposed. The cornering forces of both front and rear wheels are used to cooperate with the ESC braking forces, so as to further extend the operational envelope of the vehicle. A bi-level hierarchical control structure is employed. In the upper level, the sliding mode control with a combined sliding surface is used to generate the desired virtual control. In the lower level, a revised optimal function is defined to tune the control authority of actuators, and an algebraic operation based WPCA method is adopted. To avoid tire forces saturation and enforce a certain stability margin, a boundary layer constraint is further considered in the proposed optimization problem. A severe lane change maneuver is used to investigate the performance via closed-loop driver-vehicle- controller simulations using CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms current control practice without violating the actuators physical limitation.",

Country image affects customer attitudes and purchase intention; however, the pattern of this relationship has not been sufficiently studied. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the relationships among country image, electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) and purchase intention of Korean cosmetic products. In this study, a comprehensive set of constructs and hypotheses were compiled and tested. A questionnaire was constructed and data were collected from 255 customers in Beijing and Shanghai. The results indicated that e-WOM mediated the relationship between country image and intent to purchase Korean cosmetic products.",
