        "abstract": "This study provides a detailed magnetostratigraphic record of subsidence in the Linxia Basin, documenting a 27 Myr long sedimentary record from the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Deposition in the Linxia Basin began at ∼29 Ma and continued nearly uninterruptedly until ∼1.7 Ma. Increasing rates of subsidence between 29 and 6 Ma in the Linxia Basin suggest deposition in the foredeep portion of a flexural basin and constrain the timing of shortening in the northeastern margin of the plateau to Late Oligocene–Late Miocene time. By Late Miocene–Early Pliocene time, a decrease in subsidence rates in the Linxia Basin associated with thrust faulting and a ∼10° clockwise rotation in the basin indicates that the deformation front of the Tibetan plateau had propagated into the currently deforming region northeast of the plateau.",

        "abstract": "Citric-acid-derived carbon nanodots are increasingly being explored as novel fluorescent nanomaterials due to their strong photoluminescence (PL). However, an accurate picture of the formation of carbon nanodots and an exhaustive structure–property correlation are still lacking. Herein we present a systematic investigation of the formation mechanism of carbon nanodots by following the pyrolysis of a citric acid–diethylenetriamine precursor at different temperatures. The collective nanodots are investigated by dynamic rheological measurements, exhibiting a strong pyrolytic temperature dependence of the viscoelastic properties. Atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the synthesized “dots” at different pyrolytic temperatures are different in essence, and the transition of their chemical structure from molecular clusters to carbogenic nanoparticles during pyrolysis is highly verified. We find that a molecular fluorophore with intense PL predominates at low temperature (u003c250 °C), but a newly created quasi-molecular fluorophore with blue-shifted and decreased PL quantum yield predominates at high temperatures (300 °C). Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy suggests that the strong PL suppression at high temperature is due mostly to a dramatic increase in the nonradiative decay rate of the quasi-molecular electronic state.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The East Asian monsoon is generally regarded to have initiated at the transition from the Late Oligocene to the Early Miocene. However, little is known about this process because of a lack of continuous strata across the boundary between the Late Oligocene and the Early Miocene in Asia. Based on previous drilling (core HZ-1) in the Miocene sediments in the southern Linxia Basin in NW China, we drilled a new 620 m core (HZ-2) into the Late Oligocene strata and obtained 206 m of continuous new core. The detailed paleomagnetism of the new core reveals eleven pairs of normal and reversed polarity zones that can be readily correlated with chrons 6Bn-9n of the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS), define an age interval of 21.6–26.5 Ma and indicate continuity from the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene. The core is characterized by the remarkable occurrence of brownish-red paleosols of luvic cambisols (brown to luvic drab soils) above reddish-brown floodplain siltstones and mudstones, which suggest that the East Asian monsoon likely began by 26.5 Ma. In contrast to the siltstone and mudstone of the Late Oligocene strata, the Miocene strata begin with a thick fine sandstone bed, which marks sudden increases in erosion and loading that most likely reflect a response to tectonic uplift. The hematite content and redness index records of the core further demonstrate that the monsoonal climate in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene in this area was mainly controlled by global temperature trends and events.",

Geomorphology, sedimentology/pedology, grain size distributions and quartz oxygen isotopic ratios collectively demonstrate the aeolian origin of the Chengdu Clay and its main source area on the TP. Evidence also supports its transport by the Westerlies and the Tibetan winter monsoon. The magnetostratigraphy of the Huagai loess section of the Chengdu Clay (on the highest river terrace of the Anchang He River) indicates that the sediments began accumulating at about 825 ka BP. This suggests the establishment of a circulation system similar to the present-day system related to the rapid uplift of the TP at that time.",

        "title": "Sedimentology, sedimentary petrology, and paleoecology of the monsoon-driven, fluvio-lacustrine Zhada Basin, SW-Tibet",
        "abstract": "In this paper we present sedimentologic, petrographic, and paleoecologic data from a ~ 810-m-thick section of late Neogene (ca. 9–7 to 1 Ma) fluvio-lacustrine deposits in the high-elevation Zhada Basin of SW-Tibet. The tectonic evolution of the Zhada Basin region, located between the Himalayan Mountains in the S and the Transhimalayan Mountains in the N, is poorly understood, but sediment accumulation was probably initiated in response to the middle/late Miocene uplift of the Gurla Mandhata and Leo Pargil domes in the E and W, respectively. The sedimentary record can be subdivided into five stratigraphic units with distinctly different lithofacies associations (LA); these are, from bottom to top: a bedload-dominated fluvial LA (Unit 1, 0–90 m); a nearshore lacustrine, deltaic LA (Unit 2, 90–220 m); an offshore lacustrine LA (Unit 3, 220–500 m); a nearshore lacustrine, fan-delta LA (Unit 4, 500–600 m); and a fan-delta/alluvial fan LA (Unit 5, 600–810 m). Clast and heavy mineral compositions revealed sediment supply from two different provenance areas, one from the south and one from the north/east, based on catchment geology of the Himalaya and Transhimalaya. Ostracode faunal assemblages are largely comparable to those of modern Tibetan lakes and allow the reconstruction of paleo-lake environments, including lake-level changes and salinity. The sedimentary pattern shows strong cyclicity at various scales (m, 10 s m, and >100 m). Small-scale cycles are interpreted as intrinsically-controlled depositional processes of deltas (lobe switching), whereas medium- and large-scale cycles are most likely forced by climate fluctuations. The overall evolution of the sedimentologic record includes: a strong and rapid increase in fluvial discharge in the uppermost portion of Unit 1, a transition from fluvial to lacustrine deposition during deposition of Unit 2, rhythmic variations in the style of lacustrine sedimentation during deposition of Unit 3, an increase in the supply of coarse clastics starting with deposition of Unit 4, and a transition from lacustrine to alluvial sedimentation during deposition of Unit 5. We speculate that the increase in discharge and, presumably, precipitation leading to the establishment of lacustrine conditions in the lower part of the section (Unit 2) is largely due to regional summer monsoon intensification during the late Miocene, and that the transition from lacustrine to alluvial sedimentation in the uppper part of the section reflects the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and winter monsoon strengthening at ~ 2.6 Ma. Keywords Zhada Basin Tibetan Plateau Monsoon Fluvio-lacustrine sedimentology Sedimentary petrology Ostracodes 1 Introduction The evolution of the Asian monsoon climate is important for our understanding of regional- to global-scale paleoclimate, but is still poorly understood. Early hypotheses on the evolution of the monsoon system assumed that conditions similar to present-day had been established at ~ 8 Ma. This was based on evidence for a drastic increase in aridity in the Himalayan foreland of NW-Pakistan ( Flynn and Jacobs, 1982; Barry et al., 1982, 1985; Quade et al., 1989 ), and for monsoon-induced upwelling in marine deposits of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea ( Kroon et al., 1991; Nigrini, 1991; Prell and Kutzbach, 1992 ) at that time. In the context of the «gravitational collapse» model, these changes were interpreted as the consequence of substantial surface uplift of the Tibetan plateau preceding the ~ 8 Ma initiation of E–W extension in southern Tibet ( Pan and Kidd, 1992; Harrison et al., 1995 ). Subsequently, however, several lines of evidence have questioned this simple picture. For example, significant E–W extension in central Tibet started at least ~ 14 Myr ago ( Blisniuk et al., 2001 ), and paleoelevation estimates based on leaf physiognomies imply that at least the southern part of the plateau was at elevations similar to today's by ~ 15 Ma ( Spicer et al., 2003 ). Moreover, it has become increasingly evident that the monsoon system was initiated much earlier than 8 Myr ago. For example, recent studies infer the presence of a monsoon climate since at least ~ 22 Ma based on a study of eolian deposits exposed NE of the Tibetan Plateau ( Guo et al., 2002 ), since at least ~ 15.5 Ma based on changes in clay mineralogy observed in sediment cores from the South China Sea ( Clift et al., 2002 ), and since ~ 12 Ma based on oxygen isotope values of authigenic carbonate in fluvial and lacustrine sediments of the Linxia Basin NE of Tibet ( Dettman et al., 2003 ). It also has been demonstrated that the post-8 Ma evolution of the monsoon climate has been much more complex than previously thought. Based on records of eolian sediments from China and marine sediments from the Indian and North Pacific Oceans, An et al. (2001) inferred three stages of evolution of Asian climates: (1) enhanced aridity in the Asian interior and onset of the Indian and East Asian monsoons, about 9–8 Ma; (2) further intensification of the east Asian summer and winter monsoons, together with increased dust transport to the North Pacific Ocean, about 3.6–2.6 Ma; and (3) increased variability and possible weakening of the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons but continued strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon since about 2.6 Ma. This is in good agreement with the results of a sedimentological study of ≤8.35 Ma eolian deposits in northern China, which suggest that the East Asian winter monsoon was characterized by (1) gradually strengthening from ca. 8–6 Ma, followed by weakening between 5 Ma and 3.5 Ma, (2) marked monsoon strengthening beginning between 3.5 Ma and 3.1 Ma, and (3) further monsoon strengthening after 2.6 Ma ( Qiang et al., 2001 ). However, a severe limitation of monsoon climate reconstructions is that, while several marine and terrestrial long-term climate records are available from sites near the Himalaya–Tibet orogen, there is no such record available from a high-elevation site within the orogen. Our work in the Zhada Basin, which contains a thick sequence of late Neogene fluvial and lacustrine deposits, is part of an effort to establish a long-term climate record in this region. In this paper, we present (1) sedimentologic and petrologic data to reconstruct sedimentary facies, provenance, and weathering conditions, and (2) ecologic data from ostracode species assemblages that allow us to infer paleoenvironmental conditions during deposition of these sediments. 2 Geologic setting The ~ 10,000 km 2 area of the Zhada Basin is located at ~ 80°E between the Himalayan and Transhimalayan Ranges to the S and N, and the Gurla Mandhata and Leo Pargil domes to the E and W, respectively ( Fig. 1 ). The southern and northern boundaries of the basin roughly coincide with the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS; Burchfiel et al., 1992 ) and the Great Counter thrust (e.g., Yin and Harrison, 2000 ). None of these structures has been studied in detail in the direct vicinity of the Zhada Basin, but both are continuous along most of the Himalayan chain, and tectonic activity along them is generally thought to have pre-dated deposition of the Zhada Basin sediments. The main phase of activity along the STDS has been estimated at 24–16 Ma (e.g., Hodges et al., 1992; Guillot et al., 1994; Harrison et al., 1995; Hodges et al., 1996; Searle et al., 1997; Dezes et al., 1999 ), with relatively minor localized brittle reactivation (e.g., Vannay and Hodges, 1996; Hodges et al., 1998; Hurtado et al., 2001 ). The chronology of movement on the Great Counter Thrust is more poorly constrained, to between 20 and 4 Ma in the Kailas region ( Yin et al., 1999 ), and between 19 and 10 Ma in more eastern portions of the orogen ( Quidelleur et al., 1997 ). The main tectonic control on the basin formation presumably was uplift of the Gurla Mandhata and Leo Pargil domes, which was initiated ~ 9 Myr ago at Gurla Mandhata ( Murphy et al., 2002 ), and probably around the same time at Leo Pargil ( Thiede et al., 2006 ). The Zhada Basin has been the subject of few previous geologic studies; however, the results of these have shown that the basin contains a ~ 800 m-thick sequence of predominantly lacustrine sediments with fluvial intervals at the base and top, and limited biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic data suggest a ca. 7–1 Ma age range for these deposits ( Zhang et al., 1981; Qian, 1999 ). Based on biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic data, the age range of these deposits has variably been estimated as ca. 7–1 Ma ( Qian, 1999 ), 9.5–2.6 Ma ( Wang et al., 2008a ), and ca. 9–1 Ma ( Saylor et al., 2009 ). In this paper, we describe a ~ 810 m-thick composite section which covers most of the Zhada Basin stratigraphy; the basal strata in our lowermost sub-section can be traced to a locality a few km farther west, where they are underlain by ca. 20–25 m-thick gravels that lie unconformably on Mesozoic limestones. Due to post-depositional erosion of the Zhada Basin strata, outcrops of the oldest deposits are found at well-exposed cliffs along the deeply incised Sutlej River Valley, whereas the youngest portions of the section are exposed closer to the basin margin in the south. Accordingly, the composite section ranges from a more basin-central setting at the base to a more marginal (southwestern) setting towards the top. We did not observe any tectonic features except for a few normal faults with a typical offset of ca. 0.1–2 m, oriented 040/70 to 070/70 (dip direction/dip) and thus slightly oblique to the Karakorum fault system to the north. 3 Methods To investigate the sedimentology, sedimentary petrology, and micropaleontology of the Zhada Basin deposits, we obtained a composite section of basin-central to south-marginal Zhada Basin deposits ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) by detailed logging and lateral correlation of thirteen individual sub-sections. The sub-sections are distributed along a N–S trending line ( Fig. 2 ) with a lateral distance of ≤1 km between the individual sub-sections. Excellent exposure, almost perfectly horizontal bedding, and high lateral continuity of the sediments facilitated the lateral correlation between the sub-sections. Lateral correlation was typically carried out by physical tracing of marker beds and the use of survey level, altimeter, and photo panels ( Fig. 2 ). Sedimentological logging was carried out at a cm- to dm-scale within marly and sandy units, and at a dm- to m-scale within thicker gravel units. Paleocurrent directions were measured throughout the entire section in ripple cross-laminated and cross-bedded sands, and cross-bedded or imbricated gravels. Gravels and sands were sampled for clast and heavy mineral analysis. Gravel deposits were investigated for clast composition and maximum clast size, and clast counts were carried out every ca. 50–100 m where gravel deposits were available. At each site, we counted 100–120 clasts and grouped them into 10 lithotypes (see below). Sand samples were sieved and ca. 5 g of the 0.06–0.3 mm size fraction were used for heavy mineral separation. 100 grains of each separated heavy mineral sample were picked, classified, and counted by Dr. Maria Mange (UC Davis/USA). Marl samples collected for paleontologic analyses (ostracodes) were washed, sieved, and dried; ostracode shells were hand-picked, counted, and classified. Habitats were reconstructed according to those of modern Lake Nam Co ostracode species. About 75 ostracode-samples have been analyzed for paleoecology so far. 4 Results 4.1 Sedimentology: description and interpretation of lithofacies The composite Zhada section ( Figs. 2 and 3 ) comprises variable proportions of siliciclastic and carbonate sediment. The lower- and uppermost parts of the section are dominated by coarse clastics (mostly gravel and coarse sand). The middle part is dominated by finely laminated and thick successions of mm- to >15 m-thick marlstones, often forming steep cliffs, and interbedded with mostly medium to coarse sands. The clastic sediments are largely unconsolidated with the exception of common occurrences of cm-thick cemented sandstones. The section can be divided into five distinct units representing different lithofacies associations based on lithology, sedimentary structures, sedimentary architecture, and lateral continuity ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). From bottom to top (with stratigraphic levels given in meters from the base of the measured section), these are: Unit 1 (0–90 m), fluvial gravels and sands; Unit 2 (90–220 m), deltaic sands and marlstones; Unit 3 (220–500 m), lacustrine-dominated sands and marlstones; Unit 4 (500–600 m), massflow-dominated deltaic gravels, sands and marlstones; Unit 5 (600–810 m), alluvial fan and fan-delta gravels. Our description and interpretation of these lithofacies associations can be summarized as follows: 4.1.1 Unit 1: Fluvial gravels and sands [0–90 m] The basal portion of the measured section comprises ca. 30 m-thick gravel and coarse sand deposits exposed along a steep cliff at the southern side of the modern Sutlej River Valley ( Fig. 2 ); these deposits can be laterally traced to a locality several km farther W, where they overlie another 20–25 m of similar coarse clastics that onlap onto Mesozoic basement (Jurassic limestone). The basal coarse clastics in the section consist of gravel (<8 cm in diameter, locally imbricated) and coarse, often pebbly sand interbedded at a m-scale ( Fig. 4 A ). These deposits contain abundant internal bedding structures like m-scale channelized cross-bedding, horizontal stratification, and dm-scale planar and trough cross-bedding. Gravel and sand form amalgamated units a few m to <10 m thick and show a moderate fining-upward grain-size trend. The bases of individual depositional units are commonly gravelly (gravel lags, pebbly sand) and sharp and slightly erosional. Massive or laminated fine-grained deposits, i.e. clay, silt and very fine sand, are usually a few dm to <4 m thick where present. The colors are gray to dark-gray, yellowish-brown, and rarely mauve. Root traces and, more commonly, plant debris and gastropod shells occur. Ripple cross-lamination is rare in fine sand layers. The fluvial succession terminates with a ca. 10 m-thick gravel sheet (clasts 10 cm in diameter) that can be laterally traced along the Sutlej River Valley for >2 km. The gravel sheet has a 2–3 m deep erosional base, and this channelized structure is filled with m-scale cross-bedded gravel beds. 4.1.2 Interpretation of Unit 1: bedload-dominated fluvial lithofacies association Rare large-scale, steeply dipping (>20°) trough cross-bedding suggests that the majority of the coarse fluvial sediments can be interpreted as channel-fill deposits. Deep erosion (up to 2 m) is uncommon, but rare intraformational mud clasts (up to >10 cm diameter) indicate erosion of nearby floodplain fines. Sheetflood deposits cannot be excluded; however, the coarse sands and gravels are commonly cross-bedded. The mauve color of some of these fine-grained sediments and the presence of few rootlets suggest weak paleosol formation, although evidence for well-developed pedogenesis has not been observed within these deposits. Trough cross-bedded sands and gravels were probably deposited within channels, whereas planar cross-bedded sands and gravels are more likely the result of migrating sand bars. Based on the depositional style, these bedload-dominated, fluvial deposits are interpreted to have formed in a gravelly braided-river system (after Miall, 1996 ). The development towards a more distal (or lateral) fluvial facies associated with less and finer sediment supply and a more stable, aggrading floodplain is suggested by decreasing bed thickness, clast- and grain-size, and thicker and more abundant overbank deposits upsection. Indicated by a reversed grain-size trend higher up, the fluvial style seems to have developed into a sandy-braided type (after Miall, 1996 ) with more stable channels. The recurrence of coarse, thick gravels at the top of this unit may be the result of intensified discharge, and the fluvial plain later transformed into a large lake system. 4.1.3 Unit 2: deltaic sands and marlstones [90–220 m] This unit is composed of mostly medium to coarse sands and interbedded sandy and silty marlstones with widespread soft-sediment deformation features ( Fig. 4 B). The marl content increases upsection, while the coarse clastic content decreases successively. The base of Unit 2 is marked by a matrix-supported gravel bed (ca. 20–40 cm thick), which directly overlies the gravel sheet on top of the preceding fluvial Unit 1; this extensive gravel bed can be traced laterally over a distance of >2 km. Above, coarse-grained pebbly sands grade upwards into finer-grained deposits including an increasing number of silty to fine sandy marlstones. The trough and rarely planar cross-bedded medium to coarse, rarely pebbly sands are similar to the fluvial sands below. The sands show both fining- and coarsening-upward trends. Above ca. 110 m, silty to fine sandy, gray to dark-gray massive marlstones, a few dm thick, are commonly interbedded with these sands. Marlstones and fine sands contain plant debris as well as rare rootlets and burrows. Wave ripple cross-lamination and soft-sediment deformation features include slumps and water (or gas) escape and load structures ( Fig. 4 B). Moreover, abundant gastropod shells characterize horizons within gray to dark-gray silt and fine sand beds. Shallow (<20 cm) stacked sandy channel-fills are common. Low-angle, large-scale cross-bedding is observed in medium to coarse (pebbly) sand above ~ 120 m, associated with climbing ripple cross-lamination, rootlets, burrows and soft-sediment deformation features. Channel-fill deposits of coarse to pebbly sand with set thicknesses of 0.5–1.0 m, and thin (mm-cm) sheet-like laminated, mostly graded medium to coarse sands are also present. From 90 m on upwards, iron oxide crusts generally separate marlstones from sands with a very thin (commonly <1 mm, rarely >2 mm), sharp contact, even in strongly deformed sequences. 4.1.4 Interpretation of Unit 2: nearshore lacustrine (deltaic) lithofacies association The matrix-supported gravel bed at the base of this unit is interpreted as debris flow deposit blanketing a «drowning» fluvial plain. Overlying trough cross-bedded coarse, pebbly sands (90–110 m; Fig. 3 ) were probably deposited in interdistributary channels by bedload-dominated subaerial to subaqueous currents of a fluvial-dominated delta-plain (e.g., Elliott, 1986, 1989 ); remnants of fossil wood, common in these deposits, are characteristic for such a deltaic setting. Thin, massive silty marlstones with shell fragments that formed on top of these coarse sediments are interpreted as marsh deposits on the delta-plain (e.g., Bhattacharya and Walker, 1992 ). Higher up in the section (110–220 m), the interbedded siliciclastic and marlstone deposits were presumably formed in subaqueous delta-front and prodelta-slope environments (e.g., Elliott, 1989; Bhattacharya and Walker, 1992 ). Trough and planar cross-bedded medium to coarse sand beds with rare marlstone intraclasts are interpreted as mouth-bar deposits formed on the proximal delta-front. Rare channel-fill deposits ( Fig. 4 B) were deposited in distributary channels of the delta-front. Beds characterized by soft-sediment deformation formed on the proximal slopes of the delta-front, where sediment supply was highest and may have exceeded the stability of the inclined delta-front slopes ( Fig. 4 B; see, e.g., Moretti and Sabato, 2007 ). Sands containing burrows and plant debris are interpreted as subaqueous levee and crevasse splay deposits of interdistributary bays near distributary channels. Ostracode assemblages (see below) are predominantly composed of shallow-water species, which supports the interpretation of a delta-plain. The low-angle, large-scale (swaley) cross-bedding at ca. 120–160 m is interpreted as hummocky cross-stratification (HCS). In combination with associated wave ripple cross-lamination, these structures suggest lacustrine conditions above the storm wave base (e.g., Eyles and Clark, 1986; Dumas and Arnott, 2006 ), similar to a shallow marine lower shoreface environment ( Walker and Plint, 1992 ). The HCS structures and the very common reworking by wave activity suggest a strong influence of wind ( Horton and Schmitt, 1996; Blair and McPherson, 2008 ) and thus indicate common storm activity during this depositional interval in the Zhada Basin; this may be already a signal of monsoon activity (e.g., Quade et al., 1989; An et al., 2001 ). The graded, parallel laminated sands alternating with marlstones can be interpreted as turbiditic sands of a distal delta-front or prodelta-slope far from river entry points into the lake. Overall, its sedimentologic characteristics imply that Unit 2 represents the transition from fluvial to lacustrine facies. A delta-plain developed above the thick gravel unit at 80–90 m, consisting of coarse, trough cross-bedded interdistributary channel-fill deposits that are frequently topped by thin, finer-grained marly or silty marsh deposits. Delta-front deposits include here mouth-bar and distributary channel complexes, as well as interdistributary bay deposits and levees (e.g., Bhattacharya and Walker, 1992 ). These delta-front deposits formed laterally persistent (for several 100 m) sand bodies, on average a few meters thick. This suggests deposition over a wide area with several distributary channels rather than in front of single, isolated channels. Sediment supply was probably very high as suggested by the predominant coarse sands and comparably little fine-grained clastics of associated marshes. The topography of the lake margin was probably characterized by a very gentle slope; steeply inclined Gilbert-type prodelta foreset beds (e.g., Elliot, 1978; Schaad et al., 1992; Fernández and Guerra-Merchán, 1996; Blair and McPherson, 2008 ) were not observed. Furthermore, the typical deltaic coarsening-upwards «parasequence» is here only rarely observed (e.g., at 180–190 m), suggesting a rapidly retreating shoreline and thus a rapid expansion of the lake. The prodelta-slope consists of turbiditic graded sand sheets. This deltaic sedimentary architecture corresponds to the type-C distributary system of Postma (1990) . An increasing marl content upsection signals [a] the establishment of a large, deeper lake and [b] the widening of the lake area towards the Zhada Basin margin. Paleocurrent measurements show a northward-directed sediment transport ( Fig. 3 ) with a relatively high scatter (from WNW to ENE) indicating that the sediment source was predominantly located in the south. 4.1.5 Unit 3: lacustrine sands and marlstones [220–500 m] Unit 3, representing the central part of the Zhada section between ca. 220–500 m ( Fig. 5 A ), is largely characterized by alternating clastic and calcareous units. The sands, generally interbedded with thin marlstone layers, are typically composed of one to several m-thick, rarely channelized beds, often with sharp bases and tops. They are mostly trough cross-bedded and ripple cross-laminated, especially in the higher parts of Unit 3. The up to 20 m–thick marlstone units have varying siliciclastic contents, frequently with increasing or decreasing grain-size trends at a dm- to m-scale. Characteristic sedimentological features include fine, mm-scale lamination, varying abundance of organic matter like plant debris, common gastropod shells, and rare bones from fish and land mammals (pers. comm. Xiaomin Wang, Natural History Museum Los Angeles County, 2006). In the uppermost part of the section, above 410 m, coarsening-upwards sand units become more dominant, and dm-thick gravel beds at 455 and 480 m indicate an overall increase in grain size ( Fig. 3 ) and thus proximity to the ancient lake shoreline. The alternation of sands and marlstones at m- to dm-scale in Unit 3 forms a repeated pattern. 4.1.6 Interpretation of Unit 3: offshore lacustrine lithofacies association The marlstone-dominated Unit 3, comprising the most distal (central) part of the studied section, is assigned to a prodelta to offshore environment where laminated marls were deposited below the storm wave base ( Bhattacharya and Walker, 1992 ). Clastic input is indicated by the abundance of more or less silty and very fine sandy detritus in the marl. Well-defined and laterally persistent sand units are regularly intercalated, suggesting cyclic turbidity current activity throughout the time of deposition. The commonly graded sand units usually follow a progradational (coarsening-upwards) to retrogradational (fining-upwards) supply pattern, indicating high sediment supply to the lake basin. The rare presence of wave ripple cross-laminated sands suggests sedimentation above the storm wave base and therefore a decreasing lake level. Thus, the turbiditic sands may represent lake-level lowstand deposits, whereas the thick marlstones were formed during high lake levels (e.g., Coe, 2003 ). The alternating sands and marlstones at m- to dm-scale indicate short-term fluctuations of the lake level. Since the sands appear and disappear in a gradational way, they may possibly point towards climatic signals rather than towards tectonic pulses. Above ca. 410 m, thicker sand units developed, showing low-angle swaley cross-stratification (HCS), indicating deposition above the storm wave base (e.g., Dumas and Arnott, 2006 ). Thus, the depositional style between 410–500 m changes from quiet distal slope/offshore conditions towards a shallower, storm-influenced environment. There, the coarsening-upwards sands are topped by laminated marlstones resembling a typical prograding, shallowing-upwards deltaic «parasequence» with an abrupt flooding and deepening on top, probably caused by abandonment of distributary channels ( Coe, 2003 ). Interestingly, >15 m-thick monotonous marlstones with very few sandy interbeds observed at ca. 235–265 m indicate that the most distal (deepest?) offshore conditions already occurred relatively early during the deposition of Unit 3. This, in turn, implies that the widening and deepening of the lake basin occurred relatively fast. From 265 m upwards, clastic sediment is rhythmically supplied and the vertical extent of the offshore marlstone units becomes more and more reduced. No significant sediment transport direction can be assigned to Unit 3 since nearly all possible directions were measured ( Fig. 3 ); however, a weak predominance of NE–SW oriented directions may reflect a predominant basin-axial sediment transport. 4.1.7 Unit 4: mass flow-dominated deltaic sands and marlstones [500–600 m] Unit 4 consists of ~ 2–15 m-thick clastic sediments, mostly gravel and sand, alternating with marlstones of variable siliciclastic content ( Fig. 5 B). The thick clastic beds contain gravels with ≤10 cm diameter clasts. Among the coarse clastic sediments, many gravel beds are matrix-supported. Soft-sediment deformation is a common feature in all sediment types of Unit 4. Coarse- and medium-grained sands are commonly cross-bedded and rarely contain burrows; silty and fine-grained sandy marls are commonly finely ripple cross-laminated with abundant root traces and rare plant debris. Wave ripples occur sporadically higher up in this unit. Typically, the sediments show coarsening-upward sequences of several meters thickness with coarsest gravels at the top. Laminated and often argillaceous marlstones are abundant but never reach a thickness of more than a few meters; they abruptly formed on top of the thick clastic sequences. In contrast to the underlying lacustrine Unit 3, storm deposits are absent. No paleocurrent directions were observed in this part of the section. 4.1.8 Interpretation of Unit 4: nearshore lacustrine (fan-delta) lithofacies association The numerous m-scale coarsening-upwards sequences are interpreted as progradational fan-delta lobes of one or more fan-delta systems. These progradational prodelta-slope to delta-front sequences are typically associated with gravel sedimentation indicating a nearby alluvial fan or alluvial plain. However, there is no indication of subaerial exposure. The matrix-supported gravels are interpreted as sediment gravity deposits (mass flows). Soft-sediment deformation is similarly abundant as in Unit 2 (90–220 m). These gravels were deposited on the proximal prodelta-slope, indicating high sediment supply and a less stable and probably steeper slope. Individual fan-delta lobes are typically several meters thick and show a «classic» coarsening-upwards development (e.g., Bhattacharya and Walker, 1992; Fernández and Guerra-Merchán, 1996; Clevis et al., 2004 ) from distal marlstones into proximal coarse sands or gravels; laminated marls cap each individual lobe. This termination of coarse sediment deposition of individual lobes and the recurrence of deeper lacustrine marls is either due to the abandonment of distributary channels, or to lake-level changes, i.e., representing lacustrine transgressive surfaces (e.g., Coe, 2003 ). Cap carbonates containing stromatolites have been observed in other nearshore lacustrine environments and were interpreted as precipitates during low-energy, quiet-water conditions ( Horton and Schmitt, 1996 ). However, based on ostracode data (see below chapter 4.3), shallow-water conditions can here be ruled out. At a larger scale (tens of meters), these m-scale coarsening-upwards fan-delta lobes form stacked, progradational coarsening- or fining-upwards depositional sequences representing prograding or retrograding alluvial fan systems. This larger-scale depositional development is best documented in the grain-size distribution of the clasts ( Fig. 3 ). 4.1.9 Unit 5: fan-delta and alluvial fan gravels [600–810 m] In the uppermost portion of the Zhada section, thick and massive gravel beds become increasingly dominant, and clast sizes largely increase upsection (30 cm at maximum; Figs. 3 and 6 ). Three different kinds of gravel deposits are present here. [1] The first type comprises faint, horizontally bedded, clast-supported gravels with abundant clast imbrication. This first gravel type is composed of amalgamated, >10 m-thick gravel units that consist of 0.5–1.0 m-thick individual sheets. The clasts are significantly smaller than in type-2 gravels (see below) and faint horizontal bedding is visible. The bases are only weakly erosional or non-erosional, and elongated clasts are commonly imbricated. [2] The second type is represented by massive, often channelized, upwards-fining and clast-supported gravels. It is characterized by the largest clasts, very poor sorting, and the almost complete absence of bedding structures. Channelized bases are common and there is sometimes a crude but well-defined fining-upwards trend towards the top of these gravels. In some of these massive gravels, m-scale soft-sediment deformation structures occur. [3] The third type consists of dm- to m-thick matrix-supported gravels. The matrix is typically medium to coarse sand, and the base of these gravels is mostly non-erosional. Interbedded with these gravels are thinner (m-scale) sequences of fine- to medium-grained sands and marlstones with variable clastic contents. The sands are typically trough cross-bedded and can have a channelized base. Other sedimentary structures include horizontal lamination, and wave and current ripple cross-lamination. Marlstones are often silty or sandy, laminated, rarely massive, and may even include pebble layers. Plant detritus and root traces are common; burrows and slumps are less abundant. 4.1.10 Interpretation of Unit 5: fan-delta/alluvial fan lithofacies association Gravel beds of type [1] are interpreted as sheetflood deposits that formed during flooding events on an alluvial fan (after Blair and McPherson, 1994 ); this gravel type formed subaerially. Gravels of type [2] represent either subaerial, channel-confined flow deposits of an alluvial fan or delta-plain, or subaqueous channel-fill deposits of a proximal distributary channel (e.g., Bhattacharya and Walker, 1992 ). Fine-grained deposits on top of these gravels either document waning stages of floods on a fan or represent shallow lacustrine deposits near the outlet of a tributary channel; this may be indicated by wave ripple cross-lamination. Type [3] gravels are typical gravity-driven mass flow deposits (e.g., Horton and Schmitt, 1996 ) that were possibly generated at the unstable slope of the proximal delta front near the tributary channel-outlet. The fine-grained (sandy–pebbly) channelized interbedded lithofacies probably represent distributary channel-fill or mouth-bar deposits, while the non-erosional, mostly upwards-coarsening laminated and massive sands are interpreted as progradational fan-delta lobe deposits (e.g., Bhattacharya and Walker, 1992 ). Abundant wave ripple cross-lamination emphasizes the importance of wave action in the shallow-water environment of the delta front. Steep large-scale cross-bedding typical of Gilbert-type delta-front slopes has not been observed. The potential of wind-induced reworking of slope deposits as an important control on fan delta architecture (e.g., the destruction of large-scale foreset beds) was pointed out by Blair and McPherson (2008) . Abundant slumping features and deformed gravel beds during soft-sediment movement may also indicate a somewhat steeper slope angle and thus a steeper basin margin in this uppermost part of the Zhada section, as compared to Unit 2 (90–220 m). The sediments of Unit 5 are interpreted to reflect alternating lacustrine and alluvial environments of the delta-front (slope), delta-plain and alluvial fan ( Fig. 6 ). Delta-fan lobe progradation is seen in the coarsening-upwards grain-size trends. The often abrupt onset of marly lacustrine deposition was most probably due to channel abandonment/lobe switching of a tributary of the alluvial fan, and to lake-level rise/flooding (e.g., Coe, 2003 ), similar to Unit 4 (500–600 m). This landward coastline shift caused trapping of sediment close to the lake margin and inhibited its dispersal on top of the former delta sediments. The formation of carbonate due to petrographic changes in the source area, as pointed out by Jiang et al. (2007) , is probably less important here since we see no significant increase in carbonate, neither in the clast assemblages ( Fig. 3 ), nor in the composition of the sands. The Zhada section terminates with a thick succession of terrestrial, sheetflood-type gravels that show a general upward decrease in grain size (from 30 cm to <15 cm; Fig. 3 ). Paleocurrent directions inferred from imbricated clasts show a radial, N- to E-directed drainage pattern that further supports the interpretation of an alluvial fan depositional environment ( Fig. 3 ). A delta-type-classification is difficult based on limited lateral facies information; however, features such as common wave ripple cross-lamination and hummocky cross-stratification imply phases of strong wave influence. Since large-scale foreset beds of Gilbert-type deltas are absent, the delta-type described here can be sedimentologically classified as «gravel-dominated, shallow-water mouth-bar-type delta» ( Nemec, 1990; Postma, 1990 ). However, evidence for abundant gravity-driven mass transport indicates that somewhat steeper slope angles may have existed in the upper part of the section. 4.2 Sedimentary petrology: clast analysis, heavy minerals The petrologic composition of the Zhada Basin sediments along with numerous paleocurrrent measurements provides an excellent database for characterizing the petrology of the catchment area (e.g. Kempf et al., 1999; von Eynatten, 2003 ). Moreover, petrologic data also may provide valuable information on possible environmental changes, especially on changing weathering conditions during the time of deposition ( Mange and Maurer, 1992 ). We have therefore analyzed heavy mineral assemblages from sands and carried out clast counts of gravel beds throughout the studied Zhada section ( Fig. 3 ). 4.2.1 Clast analysis The distribution of gravel beds throughout the studied section is highly variable. Gravels occur within the basal ca. 90 m, are absent until ca. 450 m, and increasingly abundant from ca. 450 m to the top of the studied section ( Fig. 3 ); the coarsest clasts were observed above 650 m. Gravel beds in the lower part of the Zhada section (0–90 m) are dominated by sand and limestone as well as chert; granite, gneiss, and quartzite clasts are also common, as are clasts of volcanic (rhyolite) and ultramafic (serpentinite) rocks ( Fig. 3 ). Based on both catchment geology and paleocurrent measurements, these basal clasts were derived from northern and eastern sources (i.e., the Transhimalayan Mountains). Gravel beds in the upper part of the Zhada section (450–650 m) are dominated by granite, gneiss, and quartzite clasts, while sandstone and limestone clasts are much less abundant ( Fig. 3 ). Near the top of the section, above ca. 650 m, this petrographic trend reverses to more abundant sedimentary clasts. Shists are relatively rare but have been observed throughout the upper part of the section. As indicated by the paleocurrent measurements, these clasts were derived from a southern/southeastern source (i.e., from the High Himalayas). Based on the clast compositions of the gravel beds, we distinguish two different provenance areas: a northern/eastern source area located in the Transhimalayan Mountains (SW of the line Gar–Songsha–Darchen, Fig. 1 ) which include the Indus suture zone with associated ophiolites, crystalline basement, and volcanic rocks, and a southern/southeastern source area situated in the partly metamorphic rock units of the High Himalayas ( Figs. 1 and 3 ). 4.2.2 Heavy minerals In addition to the clast compositions we also investigated the heavy mineral assemblages of the sands ( Fig. 3 ) to be able to relate the clast-free middle part of the section (90–450 m) to possible provenance areas. The resulting heavy mineral suites revealed at least two different compositions and support therefore the recognition of the two different provenance areas. Samples taken from above ca. 450 m, presumably derived from a southerly source, are dominated by a suite of ultra-stable heavy minerals (>75%; zircon, tourmaline, rutile). A similar composition of samples taken between 100–250 m suggests a similar provenance area, which is supported by the paleocurrent data from this stratigraphic interval. This source area is characterized by Precambrian–Mesozoic metasedimentary quarzites, limestones, shales, and metamorphic crystalline rocks of Greater Himalaya. Samples attributed to northern and eastern provenance areas contain variable but generally considerable amounts of relatively unstable heavy minerals (up to >70%; amphibole, tremolite, pyroxene, vesuvianite, serpentinite). The source area is composed of Paleozoic–Mesozoic metasedimentary rocks (see above), ultramafic rocks, and Mesozoic–Cenozoic intrusive rocks. Sediment supply from N to NE is documented in paleocurrent directions of the basal 100 m; in the middle part of the section, however, paleocurrent data do not indicate sediment contribution from north/east but suggest sediment transport along the basin axis (ca. NW–SE), possibly caused by turbiditic currents and/or strong winds. The two clearly differing heavy mineral assemblages represent provenance signals of the different catchment areas. In addition, the very high amounts of unstable heavy minerals below 100 m and at ~ 250–450 m may point towards less intense weathering conditions (e.g., Mange and Maurer, 1992; Dill, 1995 ). However, without additional knowledge on other weathering-sensitive minerals, such as clay minerals (e.g., Yuretich et al., 1999; Gibson et al., 2000; Suresh et al., 2004 ), this aspect remains speculative at this point. 4.3 Paleoecology: ostracode faunal assemblages Ostracode species assemblages, intraspecific morphological variability, and geochemical analysis of shell chemistry may provide information on past lake levels, salinity and water chemistry, temperature, habitat structure, oxygen concentration, biologic productivity and other environmental factors ( Carbonel et al., 1988; Delorme, 1989; Boomer et al., 2003; Holmes, 2008; Mischke et al., 2008; Holmes et al., 2009 ). Diatoms were not preserved in the sediments (pers. comm. A. Lotter, Utrecht University). Ostracode valves are abundant in the marlstones of the Zhada Basin and the ostracode faunal composition is highly variable with a predominance of limnocytherid species ( Fig. 7 ), which are endemic on the Tibetan Plateau. The assemblages are largely comparable to those of modern Tibetan lakes (e.g. Lake Nam Co, near Lhasa, ca. 1200 km east of Zhada; Wrozyna et al., accepted ) and hence allow the reconstruction of ancient paleo-lake environments. The lithofacies association of Unit 1 contains no ostracodes due to very coarse material and probably fluvial conditions, which are not favorable for ostracodes. Unit 2 is characterized by Leucocytherella sinensis and Candona xizangensis which are common in Lake Nam Co at all water depths, but show a trend to shallower water. However, rather than being indicative of water depth, their presence may be controlled preferably by a high tolerance towards unfavorable or fluctuating environmental conditions. This could be caused by the presence of fluctuating contents of coarse to fine sand in the deltaic environments. Significant for paleo-lake environmental reconstruction is, for example, the species ? Leucocythere dorsotuberosa f. postilirata that occurs at present below the thermocline (25–30 m) in Lake Nam Co ( Wrozyna, 2006; Wrozyna et al., accepted ). In the Zhada Basin this species is prominent in the middle portion of the section (Units 3 and 4) indicating deep-water conditions of a lacustrine environment. The alluvial fan facies (Unit 5) includes Leucocytherella sinensis and Ilyocyppris cf. mongolica that prefer more shallow water (<10 m). Species of Ilyocypris are often attributed to fluvial environments ( Delorme, 1969 ) and have generally thick-shelled valves robust for transport by water or even by wind ( Mischke et al., 2002 ). Limnocythere inopinata, which occurs in some horizons in Unit 5, is also a shallow-water indicator and is known for high salinity tolerance ( DeDeckker, 1981; Mischke et al., 2007 ); this suggests a decreasing lake level with slightly higher salinity. Other species, which are not yet classified, have no affinity to Lake Nam Co and seem to be endemic to the Zhada Basin region («unspecified ostracodes» of Fig. 7 ). In general, diversity of ostracode species is higher in the Zhada Basin than in Lake Nam Co. This hints in general at shallower water levels in the Zhada Basin. Shallow-water depths facilitate better food supply due to a higher growth potential of macrophytes and other water plants forming a preferable habitat of ostracodes. This leads to a higher ostracode diversity, which indicates a stable living environment. However, due to the high diversity and comparably little knowledge about Tibetan ostracodes, detailed paleoecologic interpretations are yet not possible. 5 Discussion 5.1 Environmental (facies) changes From a sequence-stratigraphic point of view ( Bohacs et al., 2000 ), the fluvio-lacustrine Zhada Basin can be best considered as overfilled lake basin because both sediment supply and potential accomodation are high. The middle part of the Zhada section represents a balance-filled lake basin because of the abundant and thick lake-floor turbidites and abundant carbonates (marlstones). The change from a bedload-dominated fluvial environment of Unit 1 to a nearshore deltaic environment of Unit 2 at ca. 90 m possibly coincides with strongly increasing discharge and rapid sedimentation within the fluvial system. This environmental change formed in response to rapid lake level rise and occurred somewhat after 7–9 Ma, as indicated by magnetostratigraphy ( Wang et al., 2008a ). In Unit 2 (90–220 m), maximum grain size occurs typically near the top of the sequence; during delta-lobe abandonment, rapid flooding terminates the depositional succession. However, despite the presence of well-developed depositional, coarsening-upwards cycles, no typical Gilbert-type, large-scale delta foreset beds have been observed throughout the Zhada section. This may be explained by strong, wind-induced current activity, which has the potential to destroy or mask large-scale sedimentary structures ( Blair and McPherson 2008 ). Alternatively, the strong retrogradational nature of the deltaic sequence did not allow the construction of large-scale foreset beds; instead, the supplied sediment was distributed in the repeatedly flooded, shallow coastal areas ( Einsele, 2000 ). Thus, sediment supply was largely outpaced by basin subsidence. Ostracode specimens found in this unit are especially tolerant of unfavorable or fluctuating shallow-water environmental conditions. Deeper lacustrine environments (Unit 3, 220–500 m) are indicated by abundant marlstones and intensely wave-rippled and hummocky cross-stratified sands, and are further constrained by abundant deep-water ostracodes (? Leucocythere dorsotuberosa f. postilirata; Wrozyna, 2006; Wrozyna et al., accepted ). During deposition of the overlying deltaic sands and marlstones (Unit 4, 500–600 m), the former lake became progressively filled by coarse clastic sediments from the southern basin margin; the depositional pattern is now progradational. Abundant mass flow deposits indicate a steeper slope gradient and probably higher sedimentation rates at that time. The abundance of coarse gravels increases at the expense of lacustrine marlstones upsection. In the uppermost portion of the section (Unit 5, 600–810 m), termination of the lake environment is indicated by an increasing number of thick massive, subaerially deposited, sheetflood-type gravel units. It is also interesting to note that ostracodes point towards higher salinity in the lake water suggesting a drier climate. After the accommodation space (i.e. the lake basin) had been filled with coarse clastics, an alluvial plain formed and sediment supply was probably strongly reduced. Alternatively, sedimentation may have persisted but the valley was no longer blocked; this scenario would have resulted in very rapid incision of the modern Sutlej River into the Zhada Basin deposits. 5.2 Possible tectonic and climatic implications Tectonic processes probably exerted an important control on lake basin development, especially the initiation of basin deposition. Basin subsidence persisted for at least 5 Myr and created accommodation space for more than 800 m sediment. The basin either must have been hydrologically closed, or blocked in a way such that the outflowing river was never able to deeply incise into the bedrock of the outflow region. Based on 3D stratigraphic forward modeling of foreland basin sequences, Clevis et al. (2004) could show that the onset of tectonic activity is indicated by rapid retrogradation of depositional systems and by widespread flooding. This depositional evolution is very similar to our observations from the Zhada Basin suggesting a significant tectonic contribution to the basin formation. The tectonic framework of the Zhada Basin is currently under discussion; Wang et al. (2008b) favor a half-graben structure, while the laterally persistent horizontal bedding is more consistent with either a full graben structure or a supradetachment basin, as suggested for the strata of the Pulan Basin (dip ca. 5°; Murphy et al., 2002 ), southeast of the Zhada Basin. However, since we have no evidence from the basin margin, the discussion on the tectonic regime is speculative at this point. An important influence of climatic changes on Zhada Basin deposition is suggested by the strong and probably rapid increase in discharge at ~ 70 m in the studied section, indicated by upward coarsening in the uppermost part of the fluvial Unit 1 (0–90 m), and leading to the subsequent depositional change from fluvial to lacustrine environments. This sedimentologic change goes also along with a pronounced petrologic change from highly abundant unstable heavy minerals (Unit 1) to a predominantly ultra-stable suite (Unit 2) suggesting significant changes in the weathering conditions and drainage patterns. We speculate that although tectonic subsidence is probably a first-order control on basin formation ( Clevis et al., 2004 ), this major sedimentologic change is due to a strong increase in precipitation and, presumably, regional monsoon intensification. Moreover, widespread wave-induced sedimentary structures like wave ripples and hummocky cross-stratification in Unit 2 point towards intense winds entering the Zhada basin at that time. If we apply the so far existing chronostratigraphic time frame of the Zhada Basin ( Qian, 1999; Wang et al., 2008a; Saylor et al., 2009 ), the base of the Zhada Basin succession is assigned an age of ca. 7–9 Ma, close to the time where many previous studies have demonstrated regional monsoon intensification (e.g., Flynn and Jacobs, 1982; Barry et al., 1982, 1985; Quade et al., 1989; Kroon et al., 1991; Nigrini, 1991; Prell and Kutzbach, 1992 ). It seems from the sedimentary record that the fluvial plain drowned and a lake rapidly expanded within relatively short time, as indicated by often retrogradational deltaic depositional sequences of Unit 2 (90–220 m). At that time (shortly after 9–7 Ma; Wang et al., 2008a ), sediment supply was outpaced by lake level rise. Ostracode assemblages are here predominantly composed of shallow-water species that tolerate unfavorable and fluctuating environments, which supports the interpretation of a delta-plain to delta-front depositional environment. We further speculate that the rhythmic depositional style of the alternating thick marlstones and thin sands of Unit 3 (220–500 m) was controlled by short-term climate fluctuations between humid and arid periods that caused significant changes in lake level and depositional patterns. Other examples of short-term climate control include the Neogene Niger delta (forward modeling of sediment supply; van der Zwan, 2002 ) and the Heqing Basin, China, for the past 1 Ma ( Hu et al., 2005 ). This may be also illustrated by the presence of both deep-water and shallow-water ostracode species, and by the increasing and decreasing content of unstable heavy minerals throughout Unit 3. In the upper part of the section, sediment supply strongly increased. This is illustrated by the prograding delta lobes of Unit 4 (500–600 m), and by the prominent gravel beds characteristic of Unit 5 (600–810 m). Based on the available magnetostratigraphic age constraints from two of the three published paleomagnetic studies of the Zhada Basin ( Qian, 1999; Saylor et al., 2009 ), it seems that the appearance of the very thick and massive gravel beds at ~ 600 m temporally correlates to the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and winter monsoon strengthening at ~ 2.6 Ma ( An et al., 2001; Qiang et al., 2001 ). Thus, the Zhada section reveals a strong depositional cyclicity, which is documented in hierarchical stacking patterns at different scales based on increasing and decreasing grain sizes and carbonate content (see Fig. 5 A for outcrop scale cyclicity). As discussed above, the small-scale (~ 1–10 meter-scale) cycles that are best documented in the coarsening-upwards successions of the prograding deltas reflect most probably autocyclic processes, such as channel abandonment and delta-lobe switching. Climate-controlled small-scale cycles appear to have formed especially in Unit 3. Larger-scale (tens to >100 m) cycles, on the other hand, most likely document climatic fluctuations caused by intensity variations of the Asian monsoon (e.g., An et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2005 ). In addition, they may have been controlled by tectonic pulses which influenced the drainage system of the Zhada Basin at various temporal scales. 6 Conclusions We have presented sedimentologic, petrologic and paleontologic data from the late Neogene (ca. 9–7 to 1 Ma) Zhada Basin of SW-Tibet. The investigated composite Zhada section is located in a basin-central to basin marginal position, ca. 800 m thick, and composed of varying degrees of gravels, sands, and marlstones with fluctuating detrital contents. [1] Detailed sedimentologic investigation of the deposits revealed a succession of five fluvial and lacustrine lithofacies associations (LA). These are, from base to top, a fluvial LA of a bedload-dominated, braided-type river system (Unit 1, 0–90 m), a nearshore lacustrine LA showing the transition from a terrestrial plain into a lake (Unit 2, 90–220 m), alternating turbiditic sands and marlstones of an offshore lacustrine LA (Unit 3, 220–500 m), progradational delta-lobe sequences of a nearshore lacustrine fan-delta system (unit 4, 500–600 m), and a lacustrine to alluvial fan-delta/alluvial fan LA with coarse gravel deposits (Unit 5, 600–810 m). [2] The deltaic sediments document small-scale (m to dm) pro- and retrogradational fanlobes of a deltaic system without pronounced relief. Abundant hummocky cross-stratification is thought to have been triggered by (intensified?) storms. Repeated carbonate–siliciclastic depositional cycles of the lacustrine depositional sequence are interpreted to have been caused by climatic fluctuations rather than tectonic pulses because grain-size trends often occur gradational over a few meters and do not appear or disappear abruptly. [3] The sedimentary succession records the beginning, development, and destruction of a lake system associated with a fluvial plain. We interpret the establishment of lacustrine deposition as probably caused by a combination of tectonic basin subsidence and intensified summer monsoon precipitation, whereas the appearance of thick and massive conglomerate beds in the upper part of the section may reflect the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and winter monsoon strengthening. [4] Petrologic analyses of heavy mineral and clast data of sands and gravels resulted in the recognition of two different provenance areas in the south and north/east. This is further supported by paleocurrent measurements. However, the varying contents of stable and unstable heavy minerals also point towards fluctuations of weathering conditions, and may therefore be related to changes in the Asian monsoon intensity after ca. 8 Ma (e.g., An et al., 2001 ). [5] Ostracode faunal assemblages, very abundant in the Zhada Basin sediments, revealed strong affinity to assemblages of modern Tibetan lakes (e.g. Lake NamCo). Based on the observations of the recent Lake Nam Co, we estimated the thermocline in the former Zhada Lake at ca. 25–30 m water depth using the occurrence of species ? L. dorsotuberosa f . postilirata and Ilyocypris cf. mongolica. Shallow water depths facilitate better food supply due to a higher growth potential of macrophytes and other water plants forming a preferable habitat of ostracodes. This leads to a higher ostracode diversity, which indicates a stable living environment. However, water depth is not the only factor determining the occurrence and distribution of ostracode species; too little is known on demands and tolerances of ostracode species against single environmental factors so far.

        "abstract": "A more complete picture of the Cenozoic climate change and its driving mechanisms can only be obtained by an integrated analysis of widely distributed paleoclimate records from both oceanic and terrestrial sediments. However, there are fewer Cenozoic continental paleoclimatic records available when compared with the numerous marine records. Here, we present palynological results from the Xining Basin, northeastern Tibet, covering the Mi-1 Glaciation at around 23. Ma. We found that cold-tolerant conifers (such as Picea, Abies, Tsuga, and Larix) thrived while thermophilic plants (Rutaceae, Anacarabiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Sapindaceae, Myrtaceae, and Podocarpaceae) declined in the Xining Basin during the Mi-1 Glaciation. Both before and after the Mi-1 Glaciation, there were few cold-tolerant conifers but more abundant thermophilic plants in the Xining Basin. Our results clearly show that climate in the northern and southern hemispheres was strongly coupled during the Mi-1 Glaciation and that cooling around 23. Ma was not limited to the southern hemisphere. We argue that the most plausible linking mechanism between Antarctic cooling and Asian cooling was the combination of low orbital eccentricity with a protracted node in obliquity. © 2013.",

        "abstract": "The Pliocene-Pleistocene sedimentologic evolution of the western Qaidam Basin at the NE Tibetan Plateau was studied on the nearly thousand-meter-deep drill core SG-1 (spanning ca. 2.8-0.1 Ma), recovered from the Chahansilatu subdepression with an average recovery rate of 95%. Lithofacies variation records the regional climatic change in relation to Asian drying and Tibetan Plateau uplift. Sedimentary textures and structures demonstrate a continuous slight coarsening and an increase of evaporites upward. We recognized five lithofacies: (1) gray-black laminated mudstone, (2) gray massive mudstone and siltstone, (3) bedded halite, (4) loose muddy halite, and (5) brownish-yellowish saliferous siltstone and mudstone, representing (1) semi-deep fresh to semi-brackish lake, (2) shallow brackish lake, (3) perennial saline lake, (4) playa saline lake, and (5) saline mudflat conditions, respectively. Variation of the lithofacies through the core demonstrates a clear trend of lake shrinkage since the late Pliocene and the final termination of the Chahansilatu paleolake. Accelerations of lake shrinkages are observed at ca. 2.5 Ma, 2.2 Ma, 1.6 Ma, 1.2 Ma, 0.9 Ma, 0.6 Ma, and 0.1 Ma. Our results suggest that the long-term stepwise drying of the Asian inland may have been forced by the change of the global ice volume. Copyright © 2012, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",

Climatic characteristics of this region are very important for understanding of the Tibetan Plateau impacting on the surrounding climate.14C dating, stratigraphic correlation and grain size vs. age model were used to calculate ages for all sampling stratigraphic levels. Multi-proxy including grain size, color, magnetic susceptibility, and carbonate content analysis of Zhangla loess section at western Sichuan Plateau revealed a detailed history of climate changes since 104 ka B.P. The long-term trend of increasing grain size, middle grain sizes are 17.6 and 17.7 μm in MIS (marine isotope stage) 3 and 4, may be explained in part by a rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau events. The climate showed sub-orbital scale fluctuations similarity to millennial-scale climatic changes recorded in Nanjing stalagmite. The strength of H(heinrich) 2 significantly higher than H1. It may indicate that the climate system at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere had played an important role. There were two distinct weakening aridification recorded in MIS3, during 28-31 ka and 42-45 ka. They may suggest that the climate system also controlled by factors at low latitudes.",

        "title": "Evidence for early (≥12.7 Ma) eolian dust impact on river chemistry in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau",
        "abstract": "Abstract   As one of the largest dust sources on the Earthu0027s surface, dryland in Central Asia gives rise to thick eolian deposits over East Asia (e.g., the Chinese Loess Plateau, CLP) and significantly influences the regional hydrochemistry in the downwind drainage areas. However, the formation of thick eolian dust deposits requires not only climatic prerequisites for dust emission and transport but also climatic and topographic conditions favourable for deposition and accumulation. The scarcity of widespread eolian deposition around the CLP before 7-8 Ma hinders a full understanding of the processes and mechanisms of Central Asian aridification. The deposition of eolian dust also impacts the hydrogeochemistry of fluvial systems and the precipitation of authigenic phases in continental sedimentary systems could be an archive for studying eolian dust dynamics when pure eolian deposits are scarce. Here, we present the Ca-Mg-Sr concentrations and  87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope compositions of bulk carbonates in a new fluvial sequence (12.7-4.8 Ma) of the Xining Basin. The Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of the carbonate describe a power law relationship with a power coefficient of ∼0.8, lower than the coefficient characteristic of prior calcite precipitation (PCP). An input of eolian dust with the dissolution of Mg-rich carbonate is likely responsible for the deviation from a pure PCP process. The bulk carbonates also show a general decrease of  87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios from 12.7 to 4.8 Ma, with a transition around 8.6 Ma revealed by lower Sr/Mg ratios. The comparison of these proxies to a previously reported fluvial section (12.2-5.1 Ma) in the Linxia Basin, ∼200 km to the southeast, shows that the  87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the bulk carbonates and water-soluble salts in the Linxia Basin are around 0.7098, which is 0.0018 lower than those in the Xining Basin before 8.6 Ma, but shows a significant rise between 8.6 and 7.0 Ma. The two basins share the same range of carbonate  87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios when sediments are younger than 7 Ma. For the last 7 Myrs, the evolution of the  87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in bulk carbonates of fluvial sediments and Pliocene-Quaternary eolian deposits found in the Xining Basin are similar to those in typical eolian red clays/loess-palaeosol sequences on the CLP. These results suggest a transition of the hydrochemical regime at 8.6 Ma in the Linxia Basin from a catchment only influenced by the weathering of its bedrock to one significantly impacted by eolian dust input. In the Xining Basin, the carbonate elemental and  87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are consistent with a hydrochemistry more impacted by the presence of the eolian dust. There, the dust input occurred earlier, at ≥12.7 Ma, though it has strengthened since 8.6 Ma. The eolian dust impact on fluvial systems in the Xining Basin was much earlier than in the Linxia Basin and also preceded the initial accumulation of widespread eolian red clays on the CLP (7-8 Ma), suggesting a temporally propagating and spatially stepwise expansion of eolian dust delivery across the Asian inland during the late Cenozoic.",

The protocol uses simple and readily available nitriles and hydroxylamine hydrochloride as the starting materials and inexpensive Cu(OAc)2 as the catalyst, and the corresponding 1,2,4-triazole derivatives are obtained in moderate to good yields. The reactions include sequential intermolecular addition of hydroxylamine to one nitrile to provide amidoxime, copper-catalyzed treatment of the amidoxime with another nitrile, and intramolecular dehydration/cyclization. This finding provides a new and useful strategy for synthesis of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives.",

        "abstract": "The Chinese loess-paleosol sequences have led to a great understanding of the evolution of the East Asian monsoon (EAM) in the Quaternary. However, evolution of the EAM in the late Miocene and Pliocene is quite blurry, hindering our understanding of the mechanisms driving the EAM. Thus, we obtained high-resolution grain size records of 8.1 Ma from the thickest eolian Red Clay sequence at Chaona on the Chinese central Loess Plateau, and astronomically tuned the grain size records to the orbital variation with a time resolution of 1.5 ka to 5.8 ka. The variability of coarse size fraction, a recognized proxy for the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), indicates a persistent but stepwise intensification of the EAWM at ca. 5.5 Ma, 3.6 Ma, 2.6 Ma and 1 Ma. Filtering of this proxy record at 100, 41, and 21 ka bands was conducted to trace the evolution of the EAWM in a frequency domain over 8.1 Ma. Temporal variations of these three cycles show a remarkable simultaneous enhancement at ca. 5.5 Ma, indicating a synchronous intensification of high and low latitude signals in the EAWM record. We suggest that the closure of Panama Seaway to form the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation and the high latitude cooling during this time might collectively trigger such a response.

        "abstract": "Herein, we report the characterization of highly fluorescent citric-acid derived carbon dots (CACDs) synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of citric acid and diethylenetriamine below 200 °C. After being purified using a gel permeation chromatography cleanup system, the complexity and chemical composition of the CACDs were evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The fluorophores consisted of five-membered ring fused 2-pyridones identified as the photoluminescence origin. M06-2X density functional calculations, surface tension and morphological studies suggested DETA@5CA serves as the main building block to fabricate supramolecular aggregates. Then we proposed that the dimeric and trimeric fluorophores coupled with DETA@5CA led to “dot” topologies in the CACDs solution under the effect of hydrogen bonding. In aqueous solution, the CACDs exhibited narrowly dispersed optical properties and a high fluorescent quantum yield (∼98%). Moreover, the supramolecular interaction induced CACDs have high sensitivity under various ambient conditions, such as pH, organic solvents and metal ions.",

        "title": "Pliocene synchronous rapid uplift of the Tibet Plateau: A summary of K-Ar and paleomagnetic dating of the Main Tibet surface river terraces and basin sediments",
        "abstract": "Timing of the uplift of the Tibet Plateau provides very important boundaries to understand the mechanism of mountain building during continental collision and tectonism-climate coupling. Evidences from geology, geophysics, geomorphology and geography have resulted in various models of the uplift of the Plateau, some of which are contradictory. Precise data from the eastern and northern margins of the Plateau, critical to the reconstruction and full-view of the uplift, has been very sparse in the past. To fill this gap the Chinese Government launched three successive National Tibetan Projects (1993-1996; 1997-2000; 1998-2002; total at 9 million US$) in order to collect quantitative data on Plateau collision and uplift processes and their impacts on environment and ecology. Here we make a short summarization of the results, largely done in 2000, from dating of the Tibet surface and the Plateau marginal river terraces and basin sediments, which are sensitive to pure surface uplift, a key to judge a geomorphological rather than geological uplift of the Tibet Plateau. Along the entire foredeep bordered by the North Marginal Thrust (Kunlun-Altun-Qilian-Longmeng Trusts) to the north and east, a thick package of Cenozoic sediments records the whole history of the Plateau uplift process. It can be lithologically divided into three large units from top to bottom: light colored sediments, boulder conglomerates and red beds. The red beds are either fine sediments of lacustrine and delta origins or relatively coarser sediments of braided river and/or fan delta origin. The boulder conglomerate, mostly unconformably superimposed on the red beds, has long been viewed as evidence of rapid uplift of the Tibet Plateau. The light colored sediments are mostly eolian (desert-gobi and loess) and/or fluviolacustrine deposits. These sequences hold the key to the history of Plateau uplift. Control sections from Chaona in the Pingliang-Lingtai Basin (107.2°E, 35.1°N, eastern margin of Liupan Shan Mountains - a tectonic boundary of the NE Tibet Plateau), Linxia (103.2°E, 35.6°N) and Guide Basins (101.5°E, 36°N, NE Tibet Plateau) and Jiuquan Basin (97.5°E, 39.8°N, N Tibet Plateau) were chosen for detailed stratigraphic analysis in this study. Detailed paleomagnetic, paleontological, fission track, ESR and TL dating of these stratigraphic sequences reveal that during the Cenozoic, an initial uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau in response to early strong collision of India with Asia occurred at ∼36-30 Ma BP, which formed the basins and coarse sediments (fine conglomerate) at basin bottom. Up-fining sediments (mostly siltstone and mudstone) until ∼24 Ma suggest that the uplifted surface was reduced to a lowland or so-called peneplain or planation surface. A very strong tectonic compression, accompanied with a certain extent uplift of the northern Tibet Plateau which broke up the early planation surface, happened at ∼24-22 Ma, as indicated by strong folding of Oligocene sediments and widely distributed unconformity between the Oligocene and Miocene boundary. The early Miocene river gravel and fan delta sandstone and the middle Miocene lacustrine siltstone and mudstone indicate that the moderately raised Tibet landform was eroded down again to a lowland, i.e. the present-uplifted Main Tibet surface. Until ∼8 Ma BP, the northern Tibet Plateau began to relatively strong but progressive uplift, as indicated by a progressive unconformity and a gradual change in facies from lacustrine-dominated environment via fan delta (sandstone) to alluvial fan (conglomerates) in conjunction with the initial disintegration of the Main surface. At ∼3.6 Ma BP rapid uplift occurs, characterized by the synchronism of faulting and folding of red beds and the subsequent appearance of boulder conglomerates. Episodic volcanic rocks covering the Main surface provide a parallel approach to date the Plateau planation surface. Previous K-Ar and Ar-Ar dating of those volcanic rocks yield ages ranging from 24 to 7 Ma BP. We obtained a youngest K-Ar age of the volcanic rocks at ∼3.5 Ma BP from the eastern Tibet Plateau surface. Since these rocks and the Main surface were incised deeply by rivers, the rocks suggest that the Main surface was broken down and uplifted at ∼3.5 Ma BP, in good agreement with our basin sediment records above. Successive stepwise rapid uplifts occurred at ∼2.6, 1.8-1.7, 1.2, 0.9-0.8, and 0.15 Ma BP, manifested in the folding of conglomerates and large scale incision of the land surface by rivers. Finally we should stress that our evidence show a nearly synchronous, rather than progradated, uplift of the eastern and northern Tibet Plateau initiated at ∼8 Ma BP and began rapid since ∼3.6 Ma BP, which finally lead to a present, rather than 14 Ma BP or 8 Ma BP, maximum raised Plateau.",

        "title": "Extended drought in the interior of Central Asia since the Pliocene reconstructed from sporopollen records",
        "abstract": "A sporopollen record recovered from 5.3–1.83 Ma sediments was obtained from the lacustrine Yahu section in the central Qaidam Basin of inner Asia. The results provide evidence for vertical zonation of vegetation on the mountains surrounding the basin during the Pliocene and development of forests on the mountains and grasslands around the lake basin. At 3.6 Ma, herbaceous plants (especially xerophytic plants such as Artemisia , Chenopodiaceae and Ephedra ) increased for a short time within the basin. Xerophytic plants increased continually after 2.6 Ma in the basin, which exhibited steppe vegetation, and the climate became drier than before. These vegetation changes in the region of the Yahu section suggest a process of stepwise aridification in Central Asia's interior since the Pliocene, and it may be related to global cooling and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. Keywords Plio-Pleistocene Qaidam Basin sporopollen record aridification 1 Introduction Arid and semi-arid environments cover more than 40% of the global land surface. As the largest temperate arid region, Central Asia has attracted wide interests for its aridification. The drying appears to correspond closely with the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, the retreat of the Northern Tethys, the growth of Arctic ice, and the evolution of the East Asian monsoon ( Ruddiman and Kutzbach, 1989; Li, 1995; Ramstein et al., 1997; Rea et al., 1998; Ding and Sun, 1998; Li and Fang, 1999; An et al., 2001, 2006; Guo et al., 2002 ). Various researchers have shown that the aridification of the modern landscape began during the Miocene (or even earlier), intensified during the late Miocene, and finally reached today's conditions during the Quaternary ( Teilhard, 1937; Li et al., 1979; Zhou, 1982; Zhang, 1981; Liu and Ding, 1983; Wang, 1990; Ding and Sun, 1998; An et al. 2001, 2006; Guo et al., 2002 ). However, most of the existing evidence on this issue has been obtained indirectly, largely from the aeolian records from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) (e.g., An et al., 2001, 2006; Guo et al., 2002; Liu and Ding, 1983; Ding and Sun, 1998, 1999; Sun et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2007 ), and little from inland arid areas ( Fang et al., 2002a, 2002b; Zheng et al., 2000, 2002; Sun and Liu, 2006 ). A shortage exists of stable and continuous sediment records to provide convincing evidence. At the Qaidam Basin (an inland arid area of China, see Fig. 1 ), continuous and well-exposed Cenozoic lacustrine sediments have been deposited. Sporopollen records obtained from lacustrine sediments provide ideal organic proxies for studying changes in the regional climate and environment. This study therefore uses the sporopollen record of those Qaidam Basin lacustrine sediments to reconstruct its vegetation history, which provides a unique opportunity to study the process of aridification in Northwest China even Central Asia. 2 Geography and geology The Qaidam Basin ( Fig. 1 ), on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, lies between 36°–39°N Latitude and 90°–98°E Longitude. The Altun, Qilian, and Kunlun mountains surround this intermontane basin. The Basin lies at an elevation of 2600 to 3200 m, keeping its continental climate cold (mean annual temperature 0–5 °C) and windy. Moreover, an annual precipitation decrease from 100–200 mm at the southeast to 50 mm at the central even to 20 mm at the northwest of the basin, but a potential annual evaporation is over 20 times greater than precipitation, so the climate of the basin remains very dry. Most of the Qaidam Basin supports sparse desert vegetation on gravelly, well-drained soils. Flat areas farther from the mountains may almost completely lack vegetation. The eastern part of the basin has a relatively higher level of vegetation coverage. Dominant species include the cold-tolerant, xerophytic shrub, haloxylon ammodendron, the tamarisk , and the gymnosperm Ephedra przewalski . Other species include Nitraria vannoides , Salsola collina , and Tamarix spp . The western part of the basin consists of arid desert with almost no vegetation at all, including expanses of gravel, shifting sand and some salt deposits. Extensive saline meadows and salt marshes occur in the southern part of the basin. Characteristic vegetation in this frigid, flooded, saline/alkaline environment consists of Koresia littledalei , Aneurolepidium dasistachyum , and Polygonum sibiricum . Surrounding mountain slopes at higher elevations support shrubs adapted to cold, windy, semi-arid conditions. This alpine desert vegetation consists mainly of Ajania tibetica and the cushion plant Ceratoides compacta . Small needle-grasses like Stipa subsessiliflora form a thin ground cover in such places ( Wu, 1995 ). The selected section lies on the northeast limb of the Yahu anticline, at an elevation of 2863–2741 m, central of the Qaidam Basin ( Fig. 1 ). The field strata include the Pliocene Shizigou Formation and the Pleistocene Qigequan Formation ( Fig. 2 ). The former has an exposure of 430 m, characterized by brown and green sandstones and shale sands. The latter consists of 248 m of thickness, and consists mainly of brown and gray mudstone, gypsum sandstone, including some marlite and oolitic sandstone. Zhang et al. (submitted) assigned a stratigraphic age for the Yahu section to a range between 5.3 and 1.83 Ma with a stratigraphic lacuna of about 0.5 Ma from 4.2 to 3.7 Ma, based on paleomagnetism and fossils of ostracods and fish ( Fig. 2 ). A total of 13 normal and 13 reversed polarity intervals have been recorded in the Yahu section, marked as N1–N13 and R1–R13 in Fig. 2 , respectively. Candona yanhuensis and Eucypris inflate only appeared at ~ 2.0 Ma ( Yang, 1981 ), the upper age of the layers where they were found was controlled. Therefore, the observed polarities fit very well within chrons C2n–C3n of the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale of Cande and Kent (1995) . Thus the whole section was estimated to have been deposited between 1.83 and 5.3 Ma. But because of a small twist at the anticline a few strata are missing ( Fig. 2 ). 3 Materials and methods Our study collected 300 samples for palynological analysis of the Yahu section, at intervals of 1–3 m. Sediment samples ranging from 15 to 150 g were processed following a standard method ( Cour, 1974 ): acid digestion (treated with HCl and HF acid, removing carbonates and silicates respectively), concentration of the palynomorphs (sieved through a 10 μm mesh to remove the fine fraction) ( Ma et al., 1998 ). Finally the prepared specimens were mounted in glycerol for identification. All samples have been studied at the Lanzhou University and the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, the Chinese Academy of Sciences by comparing with officially published pollen plates and modern pollen slides preserved in the Geography Department of Lanzhou University. Some of the samples were double checked at the Tuebingen University, Germany. 4 Sporopollen record Between 100 and 646 pollen grains were counted from each of the 251 samples. The sporopollen results show that the samples at the bottom of the Yahu section contain abundant pollen grains. The content often reached more than 100 grains/g, so we identified at least 300 grains per sample under the microscope. Although the upper section contained fewer pollen grains, more than 100 grains were generally counted per sample (fewer than 10% of the samples contained less than 100 grains maybe because of preservation). The pollen taxa ( Table 1 ) have been assigned to 22 families and 45 genera. These include arboreal trees, some scrubby and herbaceous taxa, as well as a few pteridophyte and algal spores, but which all were excluded from the total pollen sum when we calculated pollen percentages. Most paleoclimate reconstructions rely on the ecological character of living taxa that sensitively reflect climate conditions. For example, the xerophilous plants Artemisia , Chenopodiaceae, Ephedra and Nitraria all reflect arid conditions. Therefore we use them as proxies for arid conditions, and define an Aridity Factor lnA: lnA = ln % A r t e m s i a + % Chenopodiaceae + % E p h e d r a + % N i t r a r i a / 1 − % A r t e m s i a + % Chenopodiaceae + % E p h e d r a + % N i t r a r i a . Greater lnA values indicate increasingly arid climates. This study interprets climate changes from lnA variations, the percentages of wet-resistant coniferous trees ( Picea + Abies , Pinus ), broadleaved trees, selected shrubs and herbs ( Ephedra , Artemisia , Chenopodiaceae), the relation of Arboral Pollen (AP) to Non Arboral Pollen (NAP) AP/NAP, and the concentrations of Pediastrum in the assemblages ( Fig. 3 ). The pollen diagram does not present other taxa, but they are named in the descriptions of the relevant pollen zones. The Pliocene–Pleistocene vegetation history of the Qaidam Basin naturally divides into three stages: 4.1 Stage I (0–140 m depth, 5.3–3.6 Ma) This stage shows the highest pollen concentrations, characterized by high values of AP (the average of AP/NAP is 9.6, varying from 0.1 to 38.6), attributed mainly to coniferous taxa (average of 70%), which are dominated by Picea and Abies (0.4% ~ 82.7%), Pinus (1.6% ~ 68.2%) and Cedrus (0 – 4.1%). Broadleaved trees (up to 7.7%) such as Betula , Quercus , Ulmus , Juglans , Salix, Alnus , Carya , Ruta , Melia are common. NAP taxa are dominated by Gramineae (up to 6.5%), and Compositae, Ephedra (0–8.2%, but almost 16% in one sample). The average of lnA in this stage is the lowest of the entire section (average −2, varying from −5.2 to 2.4). Additionally, a few fern spores have been found, consisting of Polypodiaceae, Selaginella , Lycopodium , and Pteris . Also remains of Pediastrum, a planctonic freshwater alga, are well preserved and rather abundant (average of ~ 65 grains/100 g). 4.2 Stage II (140–420 m depth, 3.6–2.6 Ma) A high proportion of AP still characterizes this stage (average AP/NAP of 6.7), accompanied by a decrease of Picea and Abies (2%–88.8%), Pinus (2.2%–65%), and slight increases of Ulmus (0–3.1%) and Betula (0–2.8%). Pollen grains of Cedrus , Tsuga , Podocarpus, Ruta , Melia , Ericaceae are seldom recorded. The percentages of shrubs and herbs exceed those in stage I, especially between 335 and 360 m (corresponding to ages from 2.94 to 2.85 Ma), where changes from 47.9% to 90% exist. The main difference between stage II and stage I is the relative increase in abundance of xerophytic plants (by an average of > 30%), such as Ephedra , Artemisia (0.3%–68%), and Chenopodiaceae (0.2%–51.5%), so that the lnA is higher (average −1.46, varying from −5.1 to 1.8). In addition, only a few samples contain Pediastrum spores, indicating lower concentrations than in stage I (average 15 grains/100 g). 4.3 Stage III (420–678 m depth，2.6–1.83 Ma) The pollen concentrations in the samples of this stage fluctuate greatly; only a few pollen grains have been detected in some samples. The average AP/NAP values (0.1–31) decrease considerably from 6.7 to 2.9. Coniferous trees like Picea and Abies (1.1%–39.8%) abruptly decrease except at a highstand (12.6%–79.6%) at the stratigraphic level between 600 and 635 m (corresponding to an age of 2.02–1.95 Ma). The herbaceous plants, however, show a drastic increase (up to 92.4%) consisting mainly of Ephedra (0–24%), Artemisia, and Chenopodiaceae. Betula (0–2.7%) and Ulmus (0–4%) contribute minor amounts, while the typical subtropical plants like Pterocarya , Melia disappear, and xerophytic plants reach their highest values (average 38%), these lead to the highest lnA values (average −0.7, varying from −3.7 to 1.7). The concentrations of Pediastrum still continued to decrease (average 2 grains/100 g), and no Pediastrum was found in most samples. 5 Discussion Modern surface pollen studies suggest that palynomorph assemblages generally over-represent Pinus , Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae (e.g., Wu and Sun, 1987; Li and Yao, 1990; Yan, 1991; Weng et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1996; Li, 1998 ). In this study, their high values may result from their high pollen production. On the other hand, the palynomorph results from the Yahu section provide evidence that the vertical vegetation zonation around the Qaidam Basin has existed since 5.3 Ma. However, our pollen findings indicate that taxa producing high amounts of pollen grains (such as Pinaceae living at high elevations surrounding the basin) also existed abundantly throughout this period. Broadleaved trees however, situated on lower slopes around the basin, produce low amounts of pollen and appear with low percentages in the pollen report. Finally, xerophytic plants (like Artemisia , Chenopodiaceae) show relatively higher percentages because of their habitat near the palaeo-lake. The reason for higher percentages of coniferous trees and lower broadleaved trees in this section, however, still requires further study. High percentages of coniferous trees, broadleaved trees and herbs (such as Gramineae and Compositae) characterize the pollen assemblages during the period of 5.3–3.6 Ma. This probably suggests a grassland zone within the basin vegetation. Conifers (such as Picea and Abies ) covered the high mountainous hinterland. The lower elevations have been dominated by a mixed mesophytic forest consisting of Pinus , Cedrus and temperate deciduous or subtropical trees, including Betula , Alnus , Acer , Ulmus , Juglans and Quercus, which represent a temperate to warm temperate climate. Pediastrum occurs frequently in freshwater environments, being part of the phytoplanktonic communities. Many studies have shown its contents can effectively indicate a lake's salinity or depth ( Sun and Wu, 1987; Xu et al., 2004; Sarmaja-Korjonen et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2007 ), which relates to the degree of drought in the surrounding environment. Hence, the appearance of Pediastrum may indicate relatively wet conditions during this period. The first main ecologic environmental shift, indicated by higher values of the aridity factor lnA (increasing from −2 to −1.4) and lower AP/NAP ratios (averages decreasing from 9.6 to 6.7), occurred at about 3.6 Ma. The percentages of thermophilous subtropical trees (such as Ericaceae, Melia ) decreased and the xerophytic plants increased their fraction from 20.8% to 30.3%, indicating a widely spreading steppe in response to cooler and drier climatic conditions. A second environmental shift occurred at ~ 2.6 Ma, manifested by the disappearance of some subtropical trees and a dramatic expansion of drought-tolerant plants. The aridity factor lnA increased from −1.4 to −0.7, the value AP/NAP clearly dropped (averages falling from 6.7 to 2.9), Podocarpus and Tsuga nearly disappeared in the palynomorph report, and Pediastrum ceased appearance in most of samples. During the period of 2.6–1.83 Ma, Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia , Aster , Ephedra , Nitraria and Tamarix grew more widespread in the basin, indicating the expansion of the steppe and a drier climate. Lithologic changes within the section investigated provide evidence supporting the major conclusions of our palynological work. The bottom of the section contains many fossil fish and layers with plant debris; while the number and size of gypsum veins increase somewhat in the middle of the stratigraphic section. The upper portion of the section contains gypsum sandstones as well as gypsum and Glauber's salt (hydrated sodium sulfate) layers. Overall, this indicates a trend towards an increasingly dry climate. However, really thick gypsum and halite layers have never been found in the upper part of the section. Enhanced aridity since 3.6 Ma corresponds with other analyses in adjacent areas. For example, Ephedra -Chenopodiaceae pollen characterize the Pliocene sporopollen assemblage of the Kuche Formation, north of the Tarim Basin ( Cao et al., 2001 ), whereas Chenopodiaceae, Ephedra and Artemisia dominate in the southern part of the Tarim Basin ( Cao et al., 2001 ) ( Fig.1 ). Dry herbs replaced temperate broadleaved trees at ~ 3.6 Ma in the Jiuxi Basin ( Ma et al., 2005 ) ( Fig. 1 ). Moreover, these changes correlate with the sharp increase in aeolian flux in the Red Clay formation of the CLP (e.g., An et al., 2001, 2006; Guo et al., 2002; Ding and Sun, 1998, 1999; Sun et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2004 ) and into the North Pacific ( Rea et al., 1998 ) around 3.6 Ma, and this can be confirmed by other records at the CLP, e.g., (1) considerable carbon isotopic data from fossil teeth and soil carbonates from the CLP suggest a humid climate during the late Miocene–early Pliocene ( Passey et al., 2009 ); (2) during the period 5.4–3.4 Ma, thermo-humidiphilous mollusk taxa found at Xifeng ( Fig. 1 ) show a warm and wet climate, whereas after 3.4 Ma their numbers decreased ( Wu et al., 2006; Li and Wu, 2010 ); and (3) biomarker records from the Chaona section ( Fig. 1 ) indicate that vegetation degraded from forest types at ~ 3.8 Ma ( Bai et al., 2009 ). At 2.6 Ma, the slightly brackish-water ostracoda Chinghaicypris Crassa replaced the pre-existing fresh and slightly brackish-water ostracoda taxa (e.g., Microlimnocythere sinensis ) in the Yahu area ( Yang, 1981 ), indicating a clear drying trend. This can be showed by other sporopollen records from adjacent areas, e.g. (1) vegetation evolved from a grassland to a desert steppe in the Jiuxi Basin ( Fig. 1 ) at 2.56 Ma ( Ma et al., 2005 ); (2) at 2.51 Ma, a broad-leaved forest-grassland changed to an open forest-steppe in the Weihe Basin ( Fig. 1 ) ( Tong et al., 2000 ), and (3) a Cupressaceae forest shifted to a steppe at Chaona ( Fig. 1 ) at 2.6 Ma ( Wu et al., 2007 ). Another dramatic change occurred in aeolian dust flux to the Pacific at ~ 2.6 Ma ( Shackleton et al., 1995 ), coincident with the onset of loess accumulation in north-central China. The above two shifts occurred at 3.6 Ma and 2.6 Ma indicated by the sporopollen record of the Yahu section was probably induced by the combined effects of the phased uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the intensive onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation. They may considerably weaken the ocean evaporation and transportation of water vapor into Asian inland, thus enhancing the aridification of the Qaidam basin since that time. 6 Conclusion The sporopollen record from the Yahu section reveals stepwise aridification around the Qaidam Basin. It provides evidence for a vertical zonation of vegetation during the early Pliocene. Temperate forests grew mainly on the surrounding mountains, while grasslands (dominated by Compositae and Gramineae) covered most of the basin plains around the lake. After 3.6 Ma, xerophilous plants increased and thermophilous trees decreased, indicating a drier climate. Since 2.6 Ma, the average percentages of xerophilous plants have continued to increase, suggesting an ongoing expansion of the steppe. This stepwise drying of the Qaidam Basin was probably induced by the combined effects of the phased uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the global cooling.

        "abstract": "The Xining subbasin of the Longzhong basin holds the longest continuous Cenozoic stratigraphic record at the margin of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Despite a rich biostratigraphic content (including the Xiejia mammal fauna), the tectonic evolution of the basin is largely unconstrained. In this study we present stratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and magnetostratigraphic results that provide a basis for reconstructing the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Xining basin with respect to adjacent regions of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Magnetostratigraphic analysis from three red bed sections in the Xining basin indicates continuous deposition at low and nearly constant accumulation rates (average 2.2 cm/kyr) from 52.0 to 17.0 Ma. We interpret this result to indicate that no major regional tectonic event implying large sediment accumulation variations has affected the Xining basin deposition during this considerable time window. In detail, accumulation rate variations outline a three-stage evolution with 1.8 cm/kyr from 52.0 Ma to 34.5 Ma, 4.1 cm/kyr from 34.5 to 31.0 Ma, and 2.3 cm/kyr from 31.0 to 17.0 Ma. The second-order increase between 34.5 and 31.0 Ma can be interpreted to result from either a distal tectonic event or to be of climatic origin. Although the region was tectonically quiescent for much of the Cenozoic, tectonic activity occurred during basin initiation (or reactivation) at circa 55.0–52.5 Ma and during intense basin deformation after 17.0 Ma.",

        "abstract": "Paleoceanographic data indicate a sudden stratification in the North Pacific Ocean around 2.75 Ma. Understanding the triggering mechanism for this sudden North Pacific stratification is one key to resolving forcing mechanisms for the Northern Hemisphere glaciation around 2.75 Ma, one of the most perplexing problems in paleoclimate research. The trigger for this sudden stratification has not been fully explored. Changes in deep-water or surface-water temperature and/or salinity can cause stratification. Here we re-examine paleoceanography data from the North Pacific Ocean and find evidence that the stratification was preceded by a surface-water salinity decrease between 2.83 and 2.75 Ma. This paleoceanographic result, in combination with recent model simulation results, suggests that fresh water input to the North Pacific via an intensified East Asian summer monsoon and/or an intensified Polar Westerly winter jet stream associated with a phase of accelerated uplift of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from 4–2.6 Ma might be one important forcing for the onset of North Pacific stratification. Onset of North Pacific stratification around 2.75 Ma is closely related to the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation around the same time via its effects on atmospheric CO 2 concentration and sea surface temperature seasonality. Forcing the onset of the North Pacific stratification and Northern Hemisphere glaciation via surface-water freshening has not been emphasized previously.",

        "abstract": "Global cooling, Tibetan Plateau uplift and the retreat of the Para-Tethys Sea have long been thought to be the key controls of the Cenozoic climate change in the Asian inland. However, due to the scarcity of long-term palaeoclimate records, it is not entirely clear which of these factors plays the major role. Here, we present new sedimentological and geochemical proxy records (TOC, carbonate, SO4 2- and Cl-) from a 1040m late Cenozoic sedimentary sequence (ca. 17 to 5.0Ma) from the western part of the Qaidam Basin, the largest inland basin on the NE Tibetan Plateau. Geochemical records reveal an evident two-stage change. From ca. 17Ma to 11.1Ma (Phase I), the proxies show an upward decrease of carbonate content and TOC concentration and a persistent increase in the concentration of the soluble anions SO4 2- and Cl-, even though superimposed high-frequency fluctuations are evident. From ca. 11.1Ma to 5.0Ma (Phase II), the average concentrations of SO4 2- and Cl- are higher than those from Phase I, and a sharp decrease in the carbonate content occurred.The sedimentological and geochemical proxy records demonstrate that the Qaidam Basin has experienced increased aridity since ca. 11.1. Ma. We suggest that the Miocene global cooling exerted a significant influence on the drying of the Qaidam Basin by decreasing evaporation rates and water vapour concentrations in the atmosphere. The Mio-Pliocene episodic and persistent uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau exerted an important influence superimposed upon this driving force, while during ca. 11.1 to 8. Ma, the rapid uplift of the Altun Shan might have played a key role in climate change of the Qaidam Basin. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "title": "Exploring Quaternary paleolake evolution and climate change in the western Qaidam Basin based on the bulk carbonate geochemistry of lake sediments",
        "abstract": "Abstract   This study focuses on the concentration of major and trace elements in the diluted acetic acid-soluble fraction of SG-1 core lacustrine sediments from the western Qaidam Basin (Tibetan Plateau) in order to explore the potential of applying bulk carbonate analysis to tracing paleolake evolution and climate change. The SG-1 core sediments are considered highly suited to the exploration of the paleoenvironmental significance of bulk carbonate geochemistry, because most carbonates in the core are authigenic in origin. Based on a principal component analysis of the elemental composition of diluted acetic acid leachate, four major components with distinct characteristics have been extracted, accounting for ~ 80% of the total variance. The first and most important component is associated with a high positive loading of Mn, P, Y, Sc and rare earth elements (REE); the second component is characterized by a high positive loading of Ca, Sr, and U; the third component displays a high negative loading of Mg, Li, and B; and the fourth component is associated with a relatively high positive loading of Fe, V and Cr. After considering the geochemical behavior of these element assemblies during acid leaching, we have concluded that these four components contain information indicative of watershed climate conditions, carbonate precipitation, lake water salinity and iron oxide content, respectively. Reconstructions of watershed climate change and paleolake evolution using the component scores are comparable to those reconstructed from other independent proxy records, indicating a long-term trend of lake shrinkage and climatic drying since ~ 2.7 Ma with abrupt drying events at ~ 2.5 Ma, ~ 1.8 Ma, ~ 1.2 Ma and ~ 0.6 Ma. Our results suggest that lake carbonates bear more information about watershed climate and lake evolution than expected, and that occurrences of some elements, in particular trace elements, in the diluted acetic acid leachate are not solely and necessarily linked to carbonate minerals.",

        "abstract": "In this work, few layer graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with a size of 3-5 nm are purposely treated with highly concentrated aqueous NaBH4 solutions to obtain the reduced graphene quantum dots (rGQDs). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate that the number of carbonyl groups decreases but -OH related defects increase during chemical reduction. Green and weak emissions of original GQDs originate from carrier recombination in the disorder-induced localized state (mainly including carbonyl and carboxyl and epoxy groups). As the reduction degree increases, the photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency of GQDs increases dramatically from 2.6% to 10.1%. In the meantime, the PL peak position blue shifts rapidly, and full width at half maximum (FWHM) becomes narrower. Thus we can infer that graphenol topological defects (hydroxyl functionalized graphene) are gradually formed during reduction. Besides, graphenol defect related PL features a longer fluorescence lifetime, excitation wavelength dependence but less pH sensitivity. ",

        "abstract": "Total 26 modern soil samples were collected from various regions under different climate conditions from tropical to arid\n temperate in China and systematically analyzed for their organic matters by GC/MS in order to evaluate climatic impacts on\n soil organic components. Abundant lipids molecules were recognized, including n-alkanes, n-alkenones, and long-chain branched\n alkanes. We find the predominance of main peaks of long-chain n-alkanes (nC29, nC31, nC33) and short-chain ones (nC16, nC17, nC18) records information of soil generation in warm-humid and cold-dry regions. The proportion of n-alkanes (nC16+nC17+nC18) to (nC29+nC31+nC33) varies in good agreement with moisture-heat conditions and thus probably can serve as a new index for climate change. The\n ratios of C21\n −/nC22\n +, nC17/nC31 and (nC15+nC17+nC19) / (nC27 + nC29 + nC31) of n-alkanes, indicating respectively input ratios of lower bacterial alga, aquatic organisms, and higher plants and terraneous\n organisms, co-vary well in different climate regions from forest to grassland and desert, suggesting that they have also reflected\n the difference of climates between monsoon region and inland one. The C21\n −/C22\n + ratio of n-alkan-2-one records largely the discrepancy of temperature from north to south of China bordered by the Qinling\n Mountains, but less humidity. The C21\n −/C22\n + ratio of n-alkan-3-ones changes well with climatic factors, such as temperature and humidity. The biogenic source of series\n A-D long-chain branched alkanes may be derived from some kinds of special epiphyte that most likely live in weak oxic-anoxic\n and moisture-heat environments, suggesting their distribution record as well some information on climatic change. All these\n researches demonstrate that the distributions of lipids molecules in modern soils in China record well signals of climates\n from quite different climatic regions, and can serve as important climatic proxies to reveal climatic change over China.",

Summer monsoon proxies of soil magnetic susceptibility, carbonate content and soil color show that Asian summer monsoon experienced a series of rapid episodic pulse enhancements spanning only ca. 1-2 ka and have sub-Milankovitch cycles of progressive weakening in low frequency domain since ca. 60 kaBP. Soil formation responds to these by deepening colors, accumulating organic matter, increasing biological channels and leaching certain carbonates. The pedogenic degree generally increases with the degree of enhancement of summer monsoon. These may reflect the impact of the last glacial fast climatic change in the North Atlantic region on Asian summer monsoon.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Longdan mammal fauna from the central part of Linxia Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau, is the first Early Pleistocene fauna in China in which the fossils are derived loess deposits, and it provides an excellent opportunity to document mammalian and environmental evolution in Asia. However, the precise age and palaeoenvironmental setting of the fauna are controversial due to the poor exposure of the outcrop section. In the present study, a 105-m-long drill core was obtained from Longdan village and used for detailed magnetostratigraphic dating. The results demonstrate that the late Pliocene- Pleistocene loess deposits in the Longdan section deposited since ca. 3 Ma and that the Longdan fauna has an age range of 2.5–2.2 Ma. In addition, the results of lithological and rock magnetic analyses demonstrate that paleosols are weakly developed throughout the whole core and that in the lower and middle parts the core the magnetic susceptibility and its frequency dependence are relatively low and uniform. These observations, combined with the ecological characteristics of the Longdan fauna, indicate that during the Early Pleistocene the climate in the Longdan area, and even in the Linxia Basin, was sub-humid and that the aeolian dust was frequently subjected to post-depositional reworking by water.",

        "abstract": "This study provides a preliminary reconstruction of paleoecological and paleoclimatic history over the central Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) during the last 8.1 Ma based on biomarker records from the earliest of the Chaona stratigraphic section. Throughout the section, we found variations in n -alkane and n -alkan-2-one distributions and dramatic changes in six other biomarker proxies: 1) n -alkanes (C 27 + C 29 )/(C 31 + C 33 ) ratios, 2) n -alkanes C 27 /C 31 ratios, 3) CPI (carbon preference index) values for CPI (H) ALK, 4) values for CPI (H) KET, 5) n -alkane mean chain lengths ACL-ALK, and 6) n -alkan-2-ones C 29 /C 31 ratios. The C 29 n -alkanes dominate the red clay sediments with little variability, indicating that trees dominated the CLP and that the climate was relatively stable and less variable during the 8.1–2.6 Ma period. In contrast, the C 31 n -alkanes dominate the loess–paleosol sediments, and biomarkers vary with relatively greater amplitude and higher frequency, indicating that grasses dominated the CLP and the climate was more arid and variable. These biomarker records chronicle a drying and cooling trend on the CLP since 4 Ma. These records can be further divided into four stages with boundaries around 5.6, 3.8 and 2.6 Ma, indicating that the CLP vegetation and climate experienced four evolutionary phases, broadly consistent with those inferred from other available proxy data. Keywords Loess–paleosol sequences Red-clay Biomarker Chinese Loess Plateau Asian drying 1 Introduction A clearer understanding of the climatic forcing mechanisms of the Asian drying and Asian monsoon will cast light on possible future climate changes. Consequently, the forcing mechanisms for the evolution of the Asian monsoon have attracted increasing attention from scientists and the public. The loess–paleosol and red-clay sequences on the CLP have been widely accepted as a valid geologic archive for documenting the history and variability of the East Asian monsoon and related climate (e.g., Liu, 1985; An et al., 1990; Ding et al., 1998; An et al., 1999, 2000; Guo et al., 2001, 2002; Miao et al., 2004; Vandenberghe et al., 2004 ); however, a number of issues remain unresolved. Recent studies indicate that the Asian desertification began around 22 Ma ( Guo et al., 2001 ), accelerated first between ~ 8 and ~ 7 Ma, and again between ~ 3.6 and ~ 2.6 Ma ( Li and Fang, 1999; An et al., 2000, 2001; Sun and An, 2002; Nie et al., 2007, 2008a,b ). However, different opinions exist about the timing, mostly because of questions about the validity of magnetic susceptibility and grain size as proxies for paleo-monsoonal changes or desertification ( An et al., 1991; Ding and Liu, 1992; Ding et al., 2001; Han et al., 2002; Nie et al., 2007, 2008a,b ). Thus, independent organic proxies are needed to help resolve these debates. Reconstructing paleo-environments using organic compounds constitutes a major field in the application of organic geochemistry. Although biomarkers have been shown to be valid climate proxies on the CLP, studies so far have largely been limited to the last 170 ka ( Yan et al., 1998; Peng and Jia, 2001; Xie et al., 2002, 2003; Wang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2006 ). Here we present preliminary organic geochemical data for the last 8 Ma from the well-studied Chaona stratigraphic section (107°12′ E, 35°6′ N) on the central CLP ( Song et al., 2000; Lü et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2007; Nie et al., 2007, 2008a,b,c ). This paper discusses the broad paleoclimate and the paleo-vegetation history of the CLP over the last 8 Ma based on n -alkane and n -alkan-2-one distributions and six other biomarker proxies: 1) n -alkanes (C 27 + C 29 )/(C 31 + C 33 ) ratios, 2) n -alkanes C 27 /C 31 ratios, 3) CPI (carbon preference index) values for CPI (H) ALK, 4) values for CPI (H) KET, 5) n -alkane mean chain lengths ACL-ALK, and 6) n -alkan-2-ones C 29 /C 31 ratios. 2 Samples and methods 2.1 Introduction to the study area and the study section The study area lies near the town of Chaona on the central CLP. The present summer climate of the study area is warm and humid and the winter climate is cold and dry. The average annual temperature and precipitation are 8–9 °C and 550 mm, respectively ( Fig. 1 ). The area presently maintains warm-temperate forest steppe vegetation, characterized by Quercus liaotungensis , Pinus tabulaeformis , Stipa bungeana , Artemisia giraldii and Bothriochloa ischaemum ( Hou, 1994 ). The entire study section is about 300 m thick; the upper 175 m comprises the loess–paleosol sequence and the lower 125 m contains the red-clay sequence. The Quaternary loess–paleosol sequences consist of 32 paleosols (S) and 33 loess (L) layers. Lü et al. (2001) has established an age model for the Chaona section, based on control point ages (top and basal ages of astronomically-tuned paleosols from sequences S 1 to S 32 for the loess–paleosol sequence, and paleomagnetic reversal ages for the red-clay sequence). Magneto-stratigraphic studies indicate that the red clay started to accumulate around 8.1 Ma at the section studied ( Song et al., 2000 ). The red clay sequence can be divided lithologically into five units (Red clay (RC)-1 to RC-5; Fig. 2 ). The first unit (RC-1) is generally brownish red, with well-developed pedogenesis; the second unit (RC-2) is relatively weakly developed with a light brownish red color; the third unit (RC-3) is the reddest of the entire red clay deposits, with strong pedogenesis; the fourth unit (RC-4) is composed of light brownish red soils; and the fifth unit is yellowish brown in color with weak pedogenesis. 2.2 Sampling and analytic methods Six paleosol (SZ-1, SZ-3 to SZ-6, SZ-9), three loess (SZ-2, SZ-7 and SZ-8), and ten red clay samples (CN-1 to CN-10) were selected for organic geochemical analyses (stratigraphic positions, ages and sequences shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 ). An aliquot (~ 20 g) of each sample was Soxhlet-extracted with chloroform for 56 h. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations range from 0.03 to 0.39% in the Chaona section ( Table 1 ). To minimize loss, we did not separate the extracted organic matter (OM) into compound classes and the extracts were directly analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A blank was analyzed to monitor for contamination. Organic solvents were doubly distilled. Filter papers were Soxhlet-extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) prior to use. GC-MS analyses were performed using a Hewlett-Packard (HP) 5973 mass spectrometer in electron ionization mode (E 70 eV) interfaced directly with a HP-6890 GC equipped with a HP-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d; 0.25 μm film thickness). The GC oven temperature was ramped upward from 80 to 300 °C at 5 °C/min and held at 280 °C for 20 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas. 3 Results 3.1 Distribution of aliphatic hydrocarbons, alkanones, and wax esters Our study found a variety of lipids in the Chaona sedimentary sequences; and reports here the distributions of C 15 –C 33 n -alkanes, isoprenoid alkanes, C 16 –C 33 n -alkan-2-ones, and C 28 –C 36 wax esters. The molecular distributions of these lipids can be used to infer paleo-vegetation, paleoclimate, and paleo-bacteria activity information. Organic matter on the CLP could be produced in situ or transported by wind. Although Liu et al. (2007) argue that the isotopic composition of loess' TOC in arid areas is largely controlled by the carbon isotope composition of the dust source (with only a minor contribution from local native vegetation), the dust source regions (i.e., the Gobi and the northwestern deserts) are very dry and exhibit low plant productivity. Thus we expect a low content of lipids ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). Based on this, we argue that the distribution of the n -alkanes in this section results mainly from: 1) microorganisms (algae, cyanobacteria, fungi and other bacteria), and 2) higher plants growing in situ . 3.1.1 Aliphatic hydrocarbons The aliphatic hydrocarbon fraction consists mainly of n -alkanes and isoprenoid alkanes (pristane and phytane, Pr/Ph ratios varying from 0.17 to 0.89; Table 1 ). Straight chain alkanes represent the most abundant hydrocarbons in the extracts. Fig. 2 shows the distributions of n -alkanes from different units. The lower molecular weight n -alkanes, dominated by the C 18 homologue are believed to come from microorganisms (algae, cyanobacteria, fungi and other bacteria; e.g., Freeman and Colarusso, 2001; Xie et al., 2002, 2003 ). The C 29 n -alkanes have been reported to come from deciduous trees ( Cranwell, 1973 ) and C 31 or C 33 n -alkanes have been proposed to come from grasses ( Cranwell et al., 1987; Meyers and Ishiwatari, 1993; Xie et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2006 ). Hence, n -alkane distribution patterns have been used to estimate changes in vegetation type and thus paleoclimate. Above C 22 , we observe a distinct odd-over-even carbon number predominance. The long-chain n -alkanes (above C 22 ) are characterized by a rather invariant distribution pattern with a C 29 dominance within the red clay sequence. In contrast, C 31 dominates within the loess–paleosol sequence, except in paleosol samples SZ-5 (corresponding to sequence S8) and SZ-9 (S28), which are dominated by the C 29 n -alkane in the high-molecular-weight (HMW) range. Previous studies on the CLP have also reported the loess-paleosol n -alkanes to be characterized by a rather invariant distribution pattern with C 31 dominance, indicating a predominance of grasslands over the CLP ( Xie et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2006 ). Our results not only confirm that grasses dominate the CLP during the last 2.6 Ma, but they also indicate that deciduous trees dominate the CLP between 8.1 and 2.6 Ma. 3.1.2 Alkanones A series of n -alkan-2-ones, ranging from C 16 to C 33 ( Fig. 2 ), were also detected. C 29 dominates these n -alkan-2-ones except in samples SZ-4, SZ-9, CN-3, and CN-4 (stratigraphic positions shown in Fig. 2 ), where C 27 dominates. The n -alkan-2-ones are commonly observed lipid components of paleosols from the CLP ( Xie et al., 2002, 2003; Wang et al., 2004 ). They are thought to originate either from microbiological sub-terminal oxidation of n -alkanes or from β-oxidation of fatty acids, followed by decarboxylation. Dominance of the C 29 homologue in both the HMW n -alkanes and n -alkan-2-ones throughout the red clay sediments favors the oxidation of n -alkanes pathway. In contrast, the dominance of the C 31 homologue in HMW n -alkanes and C 29 in HMW n -alkan-2-ones within the loess–paleosol sequence, suggests that fatty acids could be the source for n -alkan-2-ones. CPI (H) -KET and CPI (H) -ALK correlate positively in the red clay sequence and negatively in the loess–paleosols sequence ( Fig. 3 ). These relationships with CPI (H) ALK and CPI (H) KET may indicate that n -alkan-2-one sources cannot be explained solely by microbial oxidation of n -alkanes in the red clay and from β-oxidation of fatty acids followed by decarboxylation in the loess–paleosol layers ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). Alternative sources or direct input of epicuticular waxes from higher plants may have played a role ( Quénéa et al., 2004 ). This topic merits further investigation. 3.1.3 Wax esters Our analyses found wax esters, ranging mainly from C 28 to C 36 (total number of carbon atoms in the compound) at relatively low concentrations, and we did not use these to estimate vegetation and climate changes on the CLP. Alkanoic acid moieties ranged from C 14 to C 16 and n -alkanols from C 12 to C 21 , with common combinations of acid to alcohol moieties of C 14 to C 18 , and C 16 to C 18 , C 16:1 to C 14 , C 16:1 to C 16 and C 16:1 to C 18 predominating ( Fig. 4 ). Although the results differ from those previously reported from terrestrial higher plants (in the range C 36 –C 50 ; e.g., Rieley et al., 1991; Ficken et al., 1998 ), we have found similar results in modern Chinese soil samples ( Bai et al., 2006 ). 3.2 Time series of n-alkanes (C 27 + C 29 )/(C 31 + C 33 ), C 27 /C 31 , CPI (H) ALK and CPI (H) KET, ACL-ALK, and n -alkan-2-ones C 29 /C 31 The Chaona section provides six lipid biomarker proxies used to infer the evolution of the East Asian monsoon on the central CLP. 3.2.1 CPI (H) ALK, CPI (H) KET values and n -alkan-2-ones C 29 /C 31 Biomarkers from different biological origins provide different CPI values ( Cranwell et al., 1987 ), and these are affected by microbial activities, such as sedimentary reworking and diagenesis. Because the rates of degradation and alteration differ under different climatic conditions, the CPI values of paleo-lipids can thereby reflect the paleoclimate. Many studies have proposed that degradation of micro-organisms can reduce CPI values of HMW n -alkyl-lipids in soils ( Huang et al., 1996; Bull et al., 2000; Freeman and Colarusso, 2001; Xie et al., 2003, 2004 ). Under a cold, dry climate, microbial activity is low ( Kuder and Kruge, 1998 ) and thus such conditions tend to yield high CPI values ( Xie et al., 2004 ). In contrast, lower CPI values tend to result from accelerated microbial activity associated with a warm and wet climate ( Zhou et al., 2005 ). This proposal has been further confirmed by Bai et al. (2006) from modern soils in China. The CPI (H) ALK values vary from 0.89 to 6.06 and gradually decrease with increasing depth ( Fig. 5 B, see formula in Fig. 5 ). The highest CPI (H) ALK values (corresponding to sequence L26) may result from increased preservation of organic matter associated with a dry and cool climate. The CPI (H) KET values vary between 0.87 and 5.44, but do not decrease with increasing depth as do CPI (H) ALK values. This proxy's lowest values come from samples CN-4 to CN-6, which correspond to incorporate warm and wet time interval, similar to CPI (H) ALK ( Fig. 5 A). The CPI (H) -KET values and C 29 /C 31 KET ratios display some similarities throughout the profile, with minimum values in the red clay samples CN-4 and CN-5 ( Fig. 5 A). Xie et al. (2003) also observed the co-variation between the CPI (H) -KET values and C 29 /C 31 KET ratios in the Jiuzhoutai loess–paleosol sequences, Lanzhou, northwest China. These two proxies display a distinct correlation with magnetic susceptibility in the Jiuzhoutai section, and these correlations have been proposed to result from the varying levels of micro-organism activity in paleosol (loess) layers associated with the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon ( Xie et al., 2003 ). The CPI (H) ALK abnormity in sample SZ-4 (corresponding to sequence S5) probably results from increased abundances of the mid-chain length C 23 and C 25 n -alkanes. 3.2.2 Significance of n-alkane ACL values ACL values indicate the concentration-weighted mean chain length of the C 27 to C 33 n -alkanes present in a sample, and have historically been explained by differences in growing-season temperatures in the source regions ( Poynter et al., 1989 ). Plants in warmer/wetter areas have higher ACL values than those in colder/drier areas ( Zhou et al., 2005 ). The n -alkane ACL values from the Chaona section decrease with increasing depth, similar to CPI （H） ALK values. These increase from 29.3 to 30.4 with some oscillations in the loess–paleosol sequence, possibly caused by an increase in grasses, which produce large proportions of the C 31 n -alkane. The n -alkane ACL values vary from 28.9 to 29.8 in the red clay, with minimum values between CN-4 (3.96 Ma) and CN-6 (5.48 Ma), characterized by the development of woody plants ( Cranwell, 1973 ; Fig. 5 B). The values in the loess–paleosol sequence are generally similar to those at Xunyi and Luochuan (ACL values from 30.1 to 30.8 and 29.9 to 30.6, respectively) during the last 170 kyr ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). ACL values co-vary with CPI (H) ALK. They stay generally high during the loess–paleosol sequence, and reach minimum values near the level of sample SZ-9 (2.1 Ma, S28). Within the red clay sequence, the ACL values were ~ 29.5 during the time period represented by samples CN-10 to CN-8, then began to decrease at the time of CN-7 and reached minimum values in samples CN-6 to CN-4. The increasing-upward trends of the CPI (H) ALK and n -alkane ACL proxies from sample SZ-9 to the overlying Quaternary sediments suggest that the climate gradually became cooler in northwest China, resulting in grassland development and continued aridity. A similar pattern is also observed at Xunyi during the last 170 kyr ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). 3.2.3 The n -alkane C 27 /C 31 and (C 27 + C 29 ) /(C 31 + C 33 ) ratios Woody plants display n -alkane distributions dominated by C 27 or C 29 n -alkanes, whereas grasses produce distributions dominated by the C 31 n -alkane ( Cranwell, 1973; Meyers and Ishiwatari, 1993 ). Hence, n -alkane distribution patterns can be used to estimate changes in vegetation types ( Schwark et al., 2002; Rommerskirchen et al., 2003; Xie et al., 2002, 2003; Liang et al., 2005 ). Fig. 6 shows a ternary diagram for the same three n -alkanes (C 27 , C 29 and C 31 ) in the Chaona section, with two recognizable clusters of sites. The red clay cluster (samples CN-1-10, SZ-4 and SZ-9) plots close to the region that characterizes equatorial rain forests ( Schwark et al., 2002; Rommerskirchen et al., 2003 ). The loess and paleosol clusters plot near the position characterized by the deserts and savannah grasslands in Southwest Africa and CLP dominated by grasses over the last 170 kyr ( Schwark et al., 2002; Rommerskirchen et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2006 ). This difference can best be explained in terms of vegetation, that is, grasses dominate the loess–paleosols with some increase in trees during the warm stages, especially SZ-4 (S5) and SZ-9 (S28), and deciduous trees dominate during deposition of the red clay. In the Chaona section, the C 27 /C 31 and (C 27 + C 29 )/(C 31 + C 33 ) ratio curves essentially parallel each other, with higher values in the red clay, especially between CN-4 to CN-6, suggesting the prevalence of deciduous trees between 5.6 and 3.86 Ma. The decreasing trends of these ratios upward from sample CN-4 to the overlying Quaternary sediments indicate gradual development of grasslands after 3.8 Ma ( Fig. 5 C), probably due to gradually cooling temperatures, which caused continued aridity over the CLP. In summary, these proxies correlate well with each other ( Fig. 5 ), which further suggests that climate, rather than local factors, provided the drivers for their variations. 4 Discussion and conclusions 4.1 Cooling and drying trends on the CLP since 4 Ma Increasing ACL-ALK values and decreasing C 27 /C 31 and (C 27 + C 29 )/(C 31 + C 33 ) ratios after 4 Ma indicate that the CLP experienced cooling and drying (greater seasonality of precipitation) trends, respectively. These cooling and drying trends on the CLP are especially apparent during the 4–2.6 Ma interval. Dramatic cooling and drying on the CLP starting from 4 Ma coincide with many lines of evidence that indicate Tibetan uplift ( Nie et al., 2008a,b ), but precede the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere expansions around 3.6 Ma ( Mudelsee and Raymo, 2005 ). Therefore, the rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau may have triggered the dramatic cooling and drying on the CLP. This explanation agrees with model simulations by An et al. (2001) . In contrast, the cooling and drying on the CLP after 2.6 Ma could have been paced by the expanding Northern Hemisphere cryosphere, as evidenced by increasingly positive glacial benthic oxygen isotope values. 4.2 Four evolutionary phases of paleoclimate and paleo-vegetation on the CLP within the last 8 Ma From 8.1 to 2.6 Ma, C 29 n -alkanes dominate the red clay sediments, suggesting a predominance of deciduous trees over the CLP. During the last 2.6 Ma, the C 31 n -alkanes dominate the loess–paleosols, indicating a predominance of grasses over the CLP. Biomarker variations from the loess–paleosol interval exhibit relatively large amplitude and high frequency, suggesting that last 2.6 Ma was a period of unstable climate with great variability in the winter monsoon strength, as well as the presence of more grasses, Conversely the records from the underlying red clay indicate relative stability ( Fig. 5 ), suggesting that the climate was relatively warm and wet, with smaller fluctuations. Fig. 5 illustrates the temporal variations from these records and previous studies, showing three marked ecological shifts at about 5.6, 3.8 and 2.6 Ma. In Phase 1 (~ 8.1 to 5.6 Ma, samples CN-7 to CN-10), n -alkane C 27 /C 31 and (C 27 + C 29 )/(C 31 + C 33 ) ratios are lower, but CPI (H) ALK, CPI (H) KET, and ACL-ALK values are higher, compared with Phase 2 (~ 5.6 to 3.8 Ma; see Table 1 for correlation of samples with Phase; Figs. 2 and 5 ). These data suggest a mixture of woodlands and grasslands on the CLP, with less rainfall and lower temperatures. The inferred paleoclimate and paleo-vegetation assessments coincide with 1) weaker soil development (as inferred from less scattered nodules, and yellowish brown soil color; Fig. 2 ), 2) the dry-plant pollen assemblages from those portions of the Chaona section ( Ma et al., 2005 ) and the nearby Lingtai section ( Wu, 2001 ), and 3) more positive benthic oxygen isotope values compared with Phase 2 ( Shackleton et al., 1995 , Ocean Drilling Program scientific results). Chloridion and carbonate studies from the Linxia Basin also indicate a very dry climate during Phase 1 ( Fang et al., 1997 ). In phase 2 (~ 5.6 to 3.8 Ma, red-clay samples CN-4 to CN-6), the lower CPI (H) KET, CPI (H) ALK and ACL-ALK values, together with the higher C 27 /C 31 and (C 27 + C 29 )/(C 31 + C 33 ) ratios ( Table 1 ; Figs. 2 and 5 ) imply a period dominated by woodlands, decreased seasonality of rainfall, and intensified microbial activity, which in combination suggests higher temperatures. The expansion of trees on the CLP around 5.6 Ma coincides with a warmer/lower ice volume climatic condition (Fig. 2 in Nie et al., 2008a,b,c ), which suggests that global climate modulates the monsoon and vegetation variations on the CLP. During the interval 4.5 to 4 Ma, Nie et al. (2008a,b,c) suggest that precipitation on the CLP was controlled by the Polar Westerlies, rather than the East Asian summer monsoon. Our data, which suggest a tree dominance during the latter stage of Phase 2 on the CLP (in spite of a colder climate indicated by more negative benthic oxygen isotopes), supports this Westerly rainfall source hypothesis. Paleoclimatic and paleo-vegetation conditions inferred from our biomarkers are consistent with many other available proxy data, such as highly-developed soil structures, less calcite content ( Chen et al., 2007 ), and wetter-plant pollen assemblages from the same section ( Ma et al., 2005 ). In Phase 3 (~ 3.8 to 2.6 Ma, red-clay samples CN-3~CN-1), n -alkane C 27 /C 31 and (C 27 + C 29 )/(C 31 + C 33 ) ratios drop significantly compared to Phase 2; whereas CPI (H) ALK, CPI (H) KET, ACL-ALK and C 29 /C 31 KET values rise rapidly ( Figs. 2 and 5 ), indicating a cooler climate with increased seasonality of precipitation (a period of intensified winter and summer monsoons). These characteristics agree well with the pollen assemblage (3.71 to 2.58 Ma) from in this section ( Ma et al., 2005 ). In Phase 4 (~ 2.6 Ma to present), high CPI (H) ALK, CPI (H) KET and ACL-ALK values and low (C 27 + C 29 )/(C 31 + C 33 ) and C 27 /C 31 ratios ( Figs. 2 and 5 ) show the percentage of grasses on the CLP increasing and decreasing with some orbital-scale periodicity, indicating that the East Asian monsoon system is sensitive to ice sheets and insolation. Shifts in pollen assemblages from forest-steppe at 1.5 Ma to open-forest and steppe at 0.95 Ma and then to steppe at 0.5 Ma also indicate a stepwise drying of the CLP ( Wu et al., 2004, 2007 ). Systematic grain-size, paleomagnetic and geochemical measurements of the aeolian sediments in northwest China record these same transitions. These shifts appear directly related to the intensification of the East Asian paleo-monsoon during the Quaternary, probably associated with the uplift of Himalayan–Tibetan Plateau and Northern Hemisphere glaciations ( Fang et al., 1995, 1997; An et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2001; Sun, 2004 ). Given the lack of esterification and fractionation of our samples, we did not carry out a quantitative analysis of the fatty acid data. Measurements of n -alkanol and other lipid biomarkers (such as aromatic diterpenoids together with stable carbon isotopes) should provide additional tools for investigating lipid sources in this environment. We still lack detailed knowledge for many other special compounds in the Chaona section, limiting their value as specific environmental indicators. The long-term paleoclimatic and paleoecological history constructed from this study must be treated as tentative because of the coarse sampling interval. The sample resolution has been particularly limiting in determination of variation at the orbital scale. Substantially higher resolution studies and additional lipid marker proxies are required to elucidate details of climate and vegetation variability over the last 8.1 Ma.

        "abstract": "Tropical soils with unique pedogenic processes influenced by warm humid climate are investigated worldwidely.Latosols are zonal soils in tropical areas of China and have been the subject for scientists studying mineralogical and geochemical characteristics.However studies on micromorphological characteristics of the soil are still far and rare.In this study,micromorphological features and pedogenic processes of three Latosol profiles derioedfrom different parent materials from Hainan Island are studied with soil micromorphological,clay mineralogical and chemical methods.Vermiculated red soils in South China,which were formed in the mid-Pleistocene,are called Latosols in some studies.To provide evidence for the study of palaeoenvironment and archaeology,vermiculated red soils are compared with Latosols in this study.The results indicate that Latosols mainly have two typical micromorphological features.One is the absence of unweatherable minerals and illuvial clay,and the other is the presence of nodules of iron and manganese oxides resulting from weathering and isotropic b-fabric in good drainage conditions.The typical pedogenic processes of latosols are strong weathering,rubification,homogenization,eluviation and remarkable desilication.In poor drainage conditions,some pseudogley features are formed.Resulting from strong chemical weathering under the tropical climate,Latosols are strongly developed.Compared with Latosols,vermiculated red soils are less developed.They cannot be classified as latosols and Oxisols,but tend to be classified as Ultisols in the American Soil Taxonomy,corresponding to red earths in the Chinese Soil Genetic Classification.This indicates wet,warm climate and indeciduous,latifoliate vegetation in the vast areas south of the Yangtze River during the forming period of vermiculated red soils.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The origins of the evaporite deposits of the Khorat Plateau remain disputed. Based purely on the known evolution of the Khorat Plateau, materials of marine origin and/or remnant seawater should be present, but instead the salt layers of the deposits found there present typically continental lithological features. New data suggest that the Laotian evaporite deposits can be dated to the Middle to Late Cretaceous. In this paper we present the sulfate δ 34 S (5.2‰ to 15.6‰) and δ 18 O- SO4  (10.3‰ to 14.1‰) records, Sr isotopic compositions (0.707443 to 0.708587), δ 18 O -inclusion  (− 7.1‰ to 13.9‰) and δD -inclusion  (− 72‰ to − 150‰) records and the trace metal elements for halite deposits extracted from Core ZK2893 in the Sakhon Nakhon Basin, Laos. These values suggest that the deposits are of continental and hydrothermal origins with trace marine remnants. Evaporites in the basins are very likely to have been formed originally by the evaporation of seawater, prior to being dissolved in meteoric water and hydrothermal fluid, and subsequently precipitated.",

        "abstract": "The Qaidam Basin as the largest intermontane basin of the NE Tibetan Plateau is the ideal place to provide constraints on depositional and tectonic patters. To determine its tectonic deformation history and progressive evolution of growth strata we conducted paleomagnetic study on the late-Neogene stratigraphic section in the western Qaidam Basin. A magnetostratigraphic study of the well exposed 805. m Qigequan section at the Qigequan anticline in the western Qaidam Basin reveals twelve pairs of normal and reversed polarity zones which can be readily correlated with chrons C1n-3Ar of the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS). From this correlation we can conclude that the Shizigou and the Qigequan formations were formed at > 6.9 Ma-2.5. Ma and 2.5-~ 0.4. Ma, respectively. Accumulation rates determined from our chronology, together with the occurrence of unconformities suggest four phases of tectonic uplift which began at about 3.6 Ma, 2.5 Ma, 1.1 Ma and 0.8 Ma. The results also suggest that offlap growth strata according to the limb rotation model on the anticlinorium started to occur at ~ 8.2. Ma. They progressively become younger from the frontal region of the Altyn Tagh Mts. (~ 8.2. Ma) to the southwestern basin (~ 2.5 Ma) and to further east of the Qaidam Basin (< 2.5 Ma), caused by fault-propagation-folding in the Qaidam Basin, rapid uplift and fast exhumation of the NE Tibetan Plateau at those times. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The deposition of Asian dust aerosols during their trans-Pacific transport might cause significant marine phytoplankton biomass increases. However, the knowledge of the trans-Pacific dust transport, deposition, and spatial distribution is still poor due to a lack of continuous and simultaneous observations in the Asian subcontinent, the north Pacific Ocean, and North America. The severe Asian dust storm during 6 to 9 April 2001 provided an opportunity to gain a better understanding of trans-Pacific dust transport and deposition, using a comprehensive set of observations from satellites, ground-based light detection and ranging, aircraft, and surface observation networks. The observations and model simulations outline the general pattern of dust transport, deposition, vertical profile, and spatial distribution. The following points were observed: (1) the surface dust concentrations decreased exponentially with the increasing dust transport distance from 80 degrees E to 120 degrees W along the transport pathway; (2) the altitude of the dust concentration peak increased with increasing transport distance in the north Pacific region; and (3) the spatial distribution of dust deposition mainly depended on the trans-Pacific transport route.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) provides an important biologically limiting nutrient in lake ecosystems, and its concentrations furnish significant information on lake nutrient status, climatic change, and landscape development within a drainage area. This study explores the potential of calcium-bound P and iron-bound P in calcareous lacustrine sediments to reveal variations of the paleolake nutrient status and its related climatic changes. Data come from the nearly 1000-m long core (SG-1) from the western Qaidam Basin (NE Tibetan Plateau), which has been well-dated by paleomagnetism to between 2.77 and 0.1 Ma. Calcium-bound P and iron-bound P make up the two most frequent phases of inorganic phosphorus pools in the calcareous sediment. This study compares the variations of calcium-bound P and iron-bound P with the independent proxy for biologic production proxy Total Organic Carbon (TOC) as well as a climatic proxy for lake level fluctuation from the borehole. Those results indicate that calcium-bound P responds sensitively to paleolake nutrients and climatic changes, while the iron-bound P responds to more complex factors, more specific, to the content of iron oxides. Variations of the calcium-bound P in the core SG-1 show a long-term, stepwise decrease, with shifts at ~2.5 Ma, 1.8 Ma, 1.2 Ma, and 0.6 Ma, indicating a long-term stepwise decrease of the paleolake nutrient supply in the drainage. This suggests that the ecologic systems experienced a long-term deterioration, and the climate in central Asia became increasingly arid since after the late Pliocene. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",

Whether it is\n or not, it is a critical problem. A total of 55 samples were taken from the Tertiary red earth and Quaternary lacustrine deposits\n and loess in the Linxia Basin which is located in the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, for the analysis\n of quartz types and contents using electron probe microanalyzer. The results indicate that the eolian sands have existed since\n 15Ma and reached its maximum content at 8 and 6#x2013;5 Ma, respectively. This means that the climate was very dry during\n 8-5 Ma period in western China, which was regarded as the result of global climatic change at that time. Mean size of quartz\n sand grains was about 0.4 mm during 15#x2013;3.6/2.6 Ma period and dropped to 0.1–0.07 mm dramatically after 3.6–2.6 Ma. This\n demonstrates that the local eolian deposition was decreased significantly and even disappeared since Late Pliocene and was\n replaced by dust deposits from distal source, suggesting the uplift of Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and the change of air circulation\n after 3.6–2.6 Ma.",

About 0.9 Ma ago, the northern Tibetan Plateau surface had uplifted to over 3000 m a.s.l., showing that the Tibetan\n Plateau surface had reached the cryosphere; and the mountain peaks had uplifted to more than 4000 m altitude, suggesting that\n there was a glacier developed on the mountains.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Eolian dust is one of the most important factors controlling fluvial hydrological evolution in modern arid and semi-arid central Asia. Here, we present the bulk carbonate Ca–Mg–Sr concentrations and Sr isotopic compositions recorded in water soluble salts, carbonate and silicate fractions, as well as the Nd isotopic compositions in the silicate fraction of a Late Miocene (12.2–5.1 Ma) fluvial sequence exhibiting paleosol development, in the Linxia Basin on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). Bulk carbonate Mg–Sr systematics show a distinct pattern in log–log plots of Mg/Ca  versus  log Sr/Ca ratios, and clearly higher  87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios since ∼8 Ma. These findings cannot be adequately explained by the mechanism of prior calcite precipitation (PCP) – this latter process results in a positive correlation between the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in authigenic calcite, evident in the fixed gradient in their log–log plots and has been isolated as being the major factor controlling carbonate Mg–Sr systematics before 8 Ma. Nor can these findings be explained by other mechanisms related to the catchmentu0027s provenance/sedimentation. The dramatic changes in carbonate Sr contents, Sr isotopes, and Sr/Mg ratios since ∼8 Ma may therefore be inferred to have been triggered by significant inputs of eolian dust  via  the dissolution of dust carbonates and evaporites in the paleowaters where fluvial and paleosol carbonates precipitated. This process of eolian dust input can be reliably illustrated using a binary mixing model corresponding to a series of varying PCP fluxes (identical to processes affecting the area before 8 Ma) combined with a constant eolian influx calculated from the co-variations between Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Sr isotopic ratios. Eolian dust also leaves a fingerprint in the carbonate and silicate minerals of bulk sediments, as revealed respectively by their Sr and Nd isotopic compositions. Eolian dust compositions for the ∼8–5 Ma on the northeastern TP can thus be taken to be characterized by a      e    Nd      value ≤−10.5 for the silicate fraction, and by a  87 Sr/ 86 Sr value ≥0.7115 for the labile faction (carbonates and evaporites). Eolian dust is now recognized to have made a significant impact on the hydrological evolution of arid and semi-arid northern China as far back as ∼8 Ma, suggesting an enhanced regime of dust activity and regional aridification in central Asia at that time.",

        "abstract": "River sediments derived from mountains are sensitive to record the information of uplift and erosion of mountains. Fluvial and alluvial sediments, which mainly consist of sand and gravel, of 21 sites from 14 inland rivers in the north side of Qilianshan Mts. were sampled. The volume of sediments sampled is 1 m 3. The result indicates that the variations of grain-sizes are closely related to the altitude difference between the highest peak of mountains in drainage basins and the sampling sites, and this relationship can be modeled based on the statistical analysis. This model is then used to the Laojunmiao Section which is located at the north of Tibetan Plateau to reconstruct the ancient topography of the Shiyouhe Drainage Basin since 8Ma. The reconstruction curve suggests that topography of Shiyouhe drainage uplifted fluctuantly since 8Ma B.P. and abruptly uplifted at the ages of 6.36Ma B.P. and 2.70Ma B.P. There are three evident stages during the evolution of topographic difference. Mean topographic difference is about 500 m during 8-6.2Ma B.P, about 1,500 m during 6.2-2.7Ma B.P, more than 2,000 m during 2.7Ma B.P. to present days. The result basically agrees well with the claiming that northern Tibet uplift by phases since 8Ma B.P, after that come through an evident uplift at the age about 6Ma B.P., and accelerate to uplift since 3.66Ma B.P. © 2005 IEEE.",

The intrinsic TC of GCPs film is directly extracted from the dependence of the Raman G peak frequency on the excitation laser power and the first order temperature coefficient. It is found that the in-plane lattice TC increases exponentially with both of the increasing La and decreasing defect concentration. The GCPs are then used as highly processible fillers to fabricate thermoset composites based on reactive benzoxazine (BA-a).

        "abstract": "Between 2010 and 2011, this project collected and analyzed forty-nine superficial soil samples, for wax-derived n-alkane δD values (δD wax), along a south to north transect of the Tibetan Plateau, from the southern Plateau and Nepalese Himalayas, passing through the Nam Co basin, to Qilian Mountains. Twenty-two paired river water samples were also collected from northeastern Tibet during this period and analyzed for δD (δD RW). The δD RW and δD wax values become progressively more negative northward from ∼27.5°N, and reach a minimum at ∼30.6°N (Nam Co basin). North of the Nam Co basin, to 35°N, isotope values increase, due to increasing contributions from the year-round westerlies and recycled moisture from the Plateau. Relatively high and constant δD wax and δD RW values prevail in areas north of ∼35°N in northeastern Tibet. Results show that these δD wax values vary considerably with location and relate closely to the influences of the summer monsoon and circulation changes. These changes track the spatial variability of isotopes from modern river water and precipitation at large spatial scales. Paleoelevation reconstructions should take into account the impact of mixing between continental and monsoon-derived moisture on the relationships with elevation and δD wax (and linear isotopic lapse rates) for central northeastern Tibet. Based on extended and more sensitive (relative to δ 18O) δD wax and δD RW values, we infer that in the past the westerlies reached further south, to the north piedmont of the Nyainqentanglha Range, and that Indian Summer Monsoon moisture pushes across the Tanggula Mountains and approaches the Kunlun Mountains. © 2012.

        "abstract": "Continental aridification and the intensification of the monsoons in Asia are generally attributed to uplift of the Tibetan plateau and to the land–sea redistributions associated with the continental collision of India and Asia1, 2, 3, whereas some studies suggest that past changes in Asian environments are mainly governed by global climate4, 5, 6. The most dramatic climate event since the onset of the collision of India and Asia is the Eocene–Oligocene transition, an abrupt cooling step associated with the onset of glaciation in Antarctica 34 million years ago7, 8, 9. However, the influence of this global event on Asian environments is poorly understood. Here we use magnetostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy to show that aridification, which is indicated by the disappearance of playa lake deposits in the northeastern Tibetan plateau, occurred precisely at the time of the Eocene–Oligocene transition. Our findings suggest that this global transition is linked to significant aridification and cooling in continental Asia recorded by palaeontological and palaeoenvironmental changes10, 11, 12, and thus support the idea that global cooling is associated with the Eocene–Oligocene transition13, 14, 15. We show that, with sufficient age control on the sedimentary records, global climate can be distinguished from tectonism and recognized as a major contributor to continental Asian environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Qaidam Basin, located on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and containing Cenozoic sediments with a maximum thickness of ~ 12,000 m, is an ideal place to study the phased uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau and regional climate change. The estimation of the paleosalinity of sedimentary environments not only helps to evaluate the evolution of lakes in this region but offers insights into contemporaneous climate change. We present detailed geochemical and mineralogical investigations from the lacustrine interval of the Hongliugou section in the northern Qaidam Basin to reconstruct salinity fluctuations in the paleolake during the late Eocene era (~ 42.0–35.5 Ma). The clay mineral assemblages mainly contain smectite, illite, chlorite, kaolinite and irregular illite/smectite mixed layers. Clay boron-derived paleosalinity estimates (equivalent boron content, Couchu0027s paleosalimeter and B/Ga ratios) along with other proxies sensitive to salinity changes (e.g., Rb/K ratios and ostracod assemblages) collectively indicate an overall brackish sedimentary environment with a higher-salinity period at approximately 40.0–39.2 Ma. This higher-salinity period indicates a more arid environment and is probably related to global cooling. However, the global cooling in late Eocene cannot explain the overall stable long-term salinity pattern, implying that other factors exist. We propose that the migration of the Yiliping depression depocenter in the northern Qaidam and increased orographic rainfall induced by late Eocene tectonic activity at the northern margin of the basin might have partly offset the increase in salinity driven by global cooling.",

        "abstract": "Qaidam Basin is a tectonically controlled depression on the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.In 2008,a long core was drilled in Qahansilatu sub-basin in the western Qaidam Basin.The sediment layers in the upper 400 m alternate between evaporative mineral layers and carbonaceous clay layers.The detailed mineralogical investigation focused on evaporative minerals including halite,gypsum,mirabilite,thenardite,glauberite,eugsterite,bloedite,barite,cesanite,shortite,thermonatrite,gaylussite,nahcolite and inderborite.Gypsum and halite make up the majority of the evaporative minerals.Environmentally induced variations in the mineralogy and crystal habit of the sulfates have been extensively investigated.Gypsum has prismatic and pyramid habits,such as disc pyramid,stubby prismatic,slender prismatic.Visible isolated gypsum and aggregates(rosette/radial and twins) are mostly scattered in carbonaceous clay layers,suggesting secondary gypsum well developed.Gypsum may be a precursor mineral of glauberite,and thenardite is the precursor of bloedite.As a metastable and rare mineral,eugsterite does not appear in other Tibetan areas.It forms at the expense of pre existing gypsum or thenardite in the core at an experimental temperature of higher than room temperature.The presence of eugsterite indicates a warm and/or hot climate at its deposition time.Mineralogical variations have been explained by the brine evolution of Na-Cl,Na-Ca-SO4,Na-SO4,Na-SO4Cl,Na-Ca-SO4-Cl,Ca-SO4,and Na-Mg-SO4.For instance,Na-Mg-SO4 type corresponds to the bloedite,while NaCa-SO4-Cl type to the assemblage of halite,gypsum and glauberite.The evaporative minerals and carbonaceous clay layers alternation indicates the shift between dry and wet climate.According to the thickness,eighteen evaporative stages and/or dry climate stages were identified from 0.97 Ma to about 0.03 Ma.The two early dry climate stages are identified at 0.96 ～ 0.97 Ma and 0.87 Ma.The other sixteen evaporative stages occurred from 0.78 Ma to about 0.03 Ma.The evaporate-rich stages suggested that evaporation was high and groundwater inflow was sufficient at the subbasin.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Understanding the bulk organic carbon isotopic composition ( δ  13 C org ) of the surface soil in various climates is crucial for past climate reconstruction. Although the relationship between climatic factors (such as precipitation and temperature) and plant  δ  13 C org  are well studied at the global and regional scales, studies relating the surface soil organic matter  δ  13 C org  values and climatic factors remain relatively rare. In this study, 52 surface soil samples were collected from the Shiyang River drainage basin, the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, where changes in vegetation are sensitive to the climate. The  δ  13 C org  of the surface soils was analyzed to examine their environmental implications. Our results show that soil  δ  13 C org  values change from −26.58‰ to −21.73‰ with an average of −25.20‰ (±1.14‰). Binary regression analysis and linear regression analysis show that the change in the soil  δ  13 C org  values is significantly correlated with altitude; temperature and precipitation are responsible for the altitudinal impact on the soil  δ  13 C org  while air CO 2  concentrations have little effect. The sensitivity of the  δ  13 C org  values to the mean annual temperature is +0.066‰/°C and to the mean annual precipitation is −0.3‰/100 mm. We find that extremely low temperatures (above 2960 m a.s.l. in the study area) may result in physiological drought in plants even when precipitation is favorable, which consequently leads to higher soil  δ  13 C org  values. This observation is inconsistent with its direct positive role in the  δ  13 C org  values below 2960 m a.s.l., and the threshold is −1.2 °C in the Shiyang River drainage basin. In addition, the slope of the regression line for the soil  δ  13 C org  values  versus  altitude with favorable precipitation in our study is +1.2‰/km, which supports that a relationship of +1.1–1.3‰/km for the soil  δ  13 C org  values  versus  altitude is available on the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding areas and further indicates that this coefficient in this region maybe potentially be useful for paleoelevation reconstruction.",

This study examines the pollen record from the KC-1 core for the interval covering the later Early to Late Miocene (18-5. Ma). Thermophilic taxa percentages are high between 18 and 14. Ma and decrease after this time, a pattern which fits well with the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) between 18 and 14. Ma and global climatic cooling after 14. Ma. During the same period, xerophytic taxa percentages gradually increase and those of the conifers gradually decrease, suggesting an aridification process in the Qaidam region driven by the gradual strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The global climate cooling process appears to have driven the climatic development of the Qaidam Basin region throughout the Miocene, but the uplift of the Tibean Plateau also contributed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The red clay eolian sequence on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) is an important archive for paleoclimate change from the late\n Miocene to Pliocene, and can provide significant information for the controversial problems of East Asian monsoon evolution\n and its forcing mechanism. In this study, we present a pollen record from Baode, northern CLP. The record shows four stages\n of paleoecological evolution. From 5.6–4.4 Ma, a forest steppe ecosystem developed under an extremely warm period with high\n seasonal precipitation. Since 4.4 Ma, a drier episode occurred, which prompted parkland landscapes to develop. During 3.5–3.05\n Ma, the environment changed to a rather open steppe ecosystem with a much cooler and drier climate. After 3.05 Ma, the vegetation\n evolved to forest steppe. Using the percentages of arboreal plants to mirror precipitation, and comparing with other published\n pollen data from the CLP, we find the existence of S-N directionality of the precipitation change and high percentage of arboreal\n plants in the entire CLP during the Early Pliocene, which suggest the CLP was characterized by a strong East Asian summer\n monsoon. The strong summer monsoon corresponds well to the low global ice volume, which may illuminate global climate mechanism\n for the summer monsoon evolution in the early Pliocene.",

High resolution paleomagnetic dating of the Laojunmiao (LJM) section across the central LJM anticline in the southern Jiuquan Basin reveals ages of the Getanggou Member, Niugetao Member in the Shulehe Formation, the Yumen Conglomerate, Jiuquan Conglomerate and Gobi Formation at >13―8.3 Ma, 8.3―4.9 Ma, 3.66― 0.93 Ma, 0.84―0.14 Ma and 0.14―0 Ma, respectively. Sedimentary evolution study suggests that the Qilian Mountains should begin to rise gradually since ~8―6.6 Ma, accompanied by sedimentary environments changing from lacustrine mudstones-sandstones to alluvial conglom- erates. Rapid uplift of the Qilian Mountains began at ~3.66 Ma, followed by a series of stepwise or intermittent intensive uplifts at about <1.8―1.23 Ma, 0.93―0.84 Ma and 0.14 Ma, which finally resulted in the present high Qilian Mountains.",

        "abstract": "The formation and evolution of the NE Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are a key to test tectonic models of uplift of the plateau and the hypothesis of the plateau formation in relation to the Asian monsoon and the drying of Asia continent. High-resolution magnetostratigraphy from the Guide and Xining basins, Qinghai Province demonstrates that in the early Cenozoic the Guide-Xining basin was a unified weakly flexural or rejuvenated foreland basin, developed in the foothills of the eastern Kunun Mountains. The nearby Lanzhou and Xunhua-Hualong basins and the basins in the eastern Qilian Mountains may be also parts of a foreland basin. This may have caused the formation of very thick gypsum beds in Xining under paleo-subtropical conditions and wind system, before the plateau uplift. Since the early Miocene (ca. 21 Ma), the basin was subjected to flexural subsidence, accompanied by strong deformation of the early sedimentary rocks (Xining Group), and a change of river drainage from north-flowing to westerly, resulting in an unconformity between the early Xining Group and later Guide Group in the basin. This suggests that the Haiyan-Zeku dextral fault bordering the eastern Guide basin began a strong activation, which may have caused the uplift of the eastern part of the Laji Mountain, which now divides the Guide and Xining basins. In the mid Miocene, this uplift may have reached the whole Laji Shan, giving rise to south-flowing rivers and shifting the flexural subsidence center from the foothills of the Kunlun Mountains to the Laji Mountain. Since about 8 Ma, the Laji Shan began an episodic (~3.6, 2.6 and 1.8 Ma) rapid deformation and uplift, fault propagation into the Guide and Xining basins from both sides of the Laji Mountain. This caused the basin to become an intermontane basin. Since the episodic rapid uplift at about 1.8 Ma, the Yellow River appeared in the Guide Basin, forming a great (up to a thousand meters) incision, resulting in the deep valley, with its seven terraces, that are observed today. The evolution of the Guide-Xining basins demonstrates that the deformation from the early collision of India with Asia plates had reached the remote NE Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and caused an early uplift of the region. This process continued with increasing intensity, peaking at 8 Ma. This suggests a dynamic mechanism or model of a synchronous but magnitude-different deformation and uplift in the south and north Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

According to basin-moutain coupling model, the deposits in basin is sensitive to the tectonic and environmental events information related to the adjacent mountains. Geochronological of paleomangetism of late Cenozoic six red clay/bed sequences from the east foreland basin of the Liupan Shan revealed that the red clay/bed began to accumulate as early as 8.1 Ma. The initiation of red clay/bed deposition indicated the uplift of Liupan Shan at that time, which cause the disaggregating of Ordos planation surface. Stratigraphical and sedimentary rate imply the Liupan Shan experienced several tectonic uplifts, especially at late Pliocene. The undulating nature of the planation surface may be responsible for the discrepant and controversial ages and origins of the red-clay. The uplift events were mainly associated with tectonic thrusting along the northeastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau. © 2005 IEEE.",

Within them were three PEPA derivatives containing single caged bicyclic phosphate structure (1a, 2a, 3a), another three PEPA derivatives containing two caged bicyclic phosphate structures (1b, 2b, 3b) and one derivative (1c) containing three caged bicyclic phosphate structures. Structures of the products were characterized by FTIR, 1H NMR, elemental analysis and TG analysis. The reaction conditions were also discussed. Thermal analysis showed they had high thermal stability and excellent char-forming ability. Besides, these compounds had pentaerythritol bone and flame retardant elements of phosphorus, bromine or nitrogen simultaneously in their molecules, endowed them with good fire retardancy, and made them can be used as intumescent flame retardant.",

These extracts contain C 16 –C 22 n -alkan-2-ones with a predominance of even carbon number homologues and n -alkan-3-ones with exclusively odd carbon numbers. The predominance of n -alkan-2-ones is attributed to microbial reworking of soil organic matter in warm and wet southeast and southwest China. Lower molecular weight (LMW) n -alkan-3-ones (C 15 –C 21 ), maximizing at C 17 or C 19 , dominate in southeast and southwest China, while the higher molecular weight (HMW) n -alkan-3-ones (C 23 –C 33 ) with a mode at C 27 or C 29 dominate in cold, arid northwest China and Mongolia. The n -alkan-2-ones and n -alkan-3-ones exhibit strong regional variations, in agreement with the spatial distribution of climate and vegetation. Their C 15–21 /C 22–33 ratios and the carbon preference indices of the HMW (C 23 –C 35 ) n -alkan-2-ones (CPI (H) KET) sensitively reflect the variation in soil ecosystem response.",

        "abstract": "Iron-addition experiments have revealed that iron supply exerts controls on biogeochemical cycles in the ocean and ultimately influences the Earth's climate system. The iron hypothesis in its broad outlines has been proved to be correct. However, the hypothesis needs to be verified with an observable biological response to specific dust deposition events. Plankton growth following the Asian dust storm over Ocean Station PAPA (50°N, 145°W) in the North Pacific Ocean in April 2001 was the first supportive evidence of natural aeolian iron inputs to ocean; The data were obtained through the SeaWiFS satellite and robot carbon explorers by Bishop et al. Using the NARCM modeling results in this study, the calculated total dust deposition flux was 35 mg m-2 per day in PAPA region from the dust storm of 11-13 April, 2001 into 0.0615 mg m-2 d-1 (about 1100 nM) soluble iron in the surface layer at Station PAPA. It was enough for about 1100 nM to enhance the efficiency of the marine biological pump and trigger the rapid increase of POC and chlorophyll. The iron fertilization hypothesis therefore is plausible. However, even if this specific dust event can support the iron fertilization hypothesis, long-term observation data are lacking in marine export production and continental dust. In this paper, we also conducted a simple correlation analysis between the diatoms and foraminifera at about 3000 m and 4000 m at two subarctic Pacific stations and the dust aerosol production from China's mainland. The correlation coefficient between marine export production and dust storm frequency in the core area of the dust storms was significantly high, suggesting that aerosols generated by Asian dust storm are the source of iron for organic matter fixation in the North Pacific Ocean. These results suggest that there could be an interlocking chain for the change of atmospheric dust aerosol-soluble iron-marine export production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Research highlights ► This study reports the first observation of predominant even carbon-numbered n -alkanes of sediments in the continuous lacustrine-sedimentary section (Maogou) from the Late Miocene to the Early Pliocene (13–4.4 Ma) in the Linxia Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau. ► Certain types of special autochthonous bacteria are a possible source for the special distribution of even carbon-numbered n -alkanes in lacustrine sediments. ► These bacteria may have a high production rate in weak oxic–anoxic and arid depositional environments, in which a variety of geochemical parameters have recorded palaeoclimate change. ► A close correspondence among the low ratio of n -C 27 / n -C 31 , the heavy δ 13 C values of TOC and a strong even carbon-number predominance (low OEP 16–20 values) from approximately 6.5 to 4.4 Ma and at approximately 8 Ma in the studied section suggests that n -alkanes with a high predominance of even carbon-numbers may be treated as geochemical proxies for arid climate. Abstract This study reports the first observation of predominant even C-numbered n -alkanes from sediments in the continuous lacustrine-sedimentary section (Maogou) from the Late Miocene to the Early Pliocene (13–4.4 Ma) in the Linxia Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau. The n -alkanes showed a bimodal distribution that is characterised by a centre at n -C 16 – n -C 20 with maximum values at n -C 18 and n -C 27 – n -C 31 as well as at n -C 29 . The first mode shows a strong even C-number predominance (OEP 16–20 0.34–0.66). In contrast, the second mode has a strong odd C-number predominance (OEP 27–31 1.20–2.45). Certain types of special autochthonous bacteria are a possible source for this distribution of even C-numbered n -alkanes in lacustrine sediments. These bacteria may have a high production rate in weak oxic–anoxic and arid depositional environments, in which a variety of geochemical parameters have recorded palaeoclimate change. 1 Introduction The use of molecular fossils to reconstruct palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental histories has become an important part of molecular stratigraphy ( Fu and Sheng, 1992, 1996; Street-Perrott et al., 1997; Evershed et al., 1999; Sheng et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1999 ). Many types of biomarkers record information about climatic change, such as alkanes, aromatics, alkanoic acids, alkanols, alkenones and esters as well as a number of rare and special compounds ( González-Vila et al., 2003; Xie et al., 2003a,b,c; Wang et al., 2005, 2006, 2007; Bai et al., 2006a,b ). Research on these biomarkers has included investigations of aerosol ( Simoneit et al., 1991 ), marine sediments ( Volkman et al., 1995; Pearson et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2005 ), lacustrine and peat sediments ( Thiel et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1999; Xie and Evershed, 2001 ), glaciers ( Xie et al., 1999 ), ancient vegetation ( Mitra et al., 2000 ), loess ( Yan et al., 1998; Xie et al., 2002, 2003a; Wang et al., 2004 ), cave stalagmite ( Xie et al., 2003b ), estuarine sediments (rocks) ( González-Vila et al., 2003; Greenwood et al., 2004 ) and paleolake deposits ( Zhang et al., 2007 ). Normal alkanes generally constitute the major fraction of saturated hydrocarbons and their distribution patterns are characterised by the predominance of a range of C-numbers depending on the nature of the source material and its microbial or geochemical alteration. Normal alkanes are ubiquitous in sedimentary samples, and often exhibit distributions with an odd C-number predominance, which is lost during the maturation of the organic matter ( Tissot and Welte, 1984 ). A predominance of even C-numbered n -alkanes, although less frequent, has been found in a relatively wide variety of depositional environments, such as the surface sediments of coastal systems ( Palacas et al., 1972 ), marine sediments and water columns ( Debyser et al., 1977; Farrington and Tripp, 1977; Simoneit, 1977a; Nishimura and Baker, 1986 ), estuarine and riverine systems ( Grimalt et al., 1985; Elias et al., 1997; Ekpo et al., 2005 ), coal seam samples ( Grimalt et al., 1986 ) and coastal soils ( Ekpo et al., 2005 ). Debyser et al. (1977) found these n -alkanes in anoxic marine surface sediments (Black Sea and Cariaco Trench) and proposed that these molecules formed from the post-depositional reduction of fatty acids. Grimalt et al. (1985) also found these predominant even C-numbered n -alkane distributions in surface sediments of coastal oxygenated marine systems (Arabian Gulf), estuarine systems and riverine systems (Shatt-al-Arab, Iraq). These sources indicate an autochthonous, possibly bacterial, source. Nishimura and Baker (1986) reported the occurrence of these hydrocarbons in some marine oxic environments and suggested that they originated from marine bacteria. Grimalt and Albaigés (1987) reported the occurrence of n -C 12 – n -C 22 n -alkanes with a strong even C-number preference in recent and Miocene sediments in both marine and freshwater systems that had been deposited under oxic and anoxic conditions. Their research has been extended to some coal samples from seams in the Nograd basin (northern Hungary). The distribution of n -alkanes in the n -C 15 – n -C 22 range with a strong predominance of the even C-numbered homologues has been identified in coals, rocky coals and adjacent sediments of two seams formed in a paralic environment. Elias et al. (1997) identified the predominance of even C-numbered n -alkanes on the Amazon shelf and in a NE Pacific hydrothermal system, where the even C-numbered n -alkanes originate from microbes and from the alteration of algal detritus. Recently, Ekpo et al. (2005) has found that n -alkanes are distributed in surface sediments from the Calabar River and from coastal soils in the SE Niger Delta, Nigeria. These n -alkanes are thought to be derived from inputs of different microorganisms inhabiting an oil-polluted environment that contribute to the organic matter. The hydrocarbons have also been observed in seed oil ( Lamarque et al., 1998 ), and a predominance of even-numbered anteiso-alkanes (a-C 27 to a-C 35 ) has been detected in plant wax ( Reddy et al., 2000 ). In the current study, the predominant even C-numbered n -alkanes were identified for the first time in the continuous lacustrine-sedimentary section from 13 to 4.4 Ma in the Linxia Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau. The results show that the even C-numbered n -alkanes in lacustrine sediments of the Maogou section likely originated from microorganisms. Based on various geochemical parameters and the correspondence between the strong even C-number predominance of alkanes and the arid environment throughout the study section, n -alkanes likely originate from bacteria, which might preferentially live under the weak oxic–anoxic and arid environments. 2 Sampling and analytical methods 2.1 Stratigraphy and sampling The Linxia Basin is located on the north-eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau (102°30′ ∼104°E, 35°10′ ∼35°51′N, Fig. 1 ). The lateral extent of the Linxia Basin is marked by structural boundaries on the northern, western, and southern edges of the Basin but is poorly defined towards the east. To the west and south, the major basin-bounding faults within the Tibetan Plateau are the Lajishan fault and North Qinling fault, respectively. To the north, the major basin-bounding fault is the Maxian Shan fault. Sedimentary rocks of the Linxia Basin are dominated by mudstone and sandstone of fluvial or lacustrine origin. The Maogou section is located in the central part of the Linxia Basin, which is representative of the Tertiary red bed. The red bed in this area is a continuous sedimentary section from the upper Oligocene to Pliocene (30.6 to approximately 4.0 Ma BP; Li, 1995; Fang et al., 2003 ). Its total thickness is 443 m. In this study, the focus was on a continuous sedimentary stage from the Late Miocene to the Early Pliocene in order to capture climate change events. Table 1 shows the stratigraphy and the absolute age of the Maogou cross-section in the Linxia Basin ( Fang et al., 1997 ). Twenty lacustrine sediment samples were collected from the bottom to the top, from 13 Ma to 4.5 Ma in the 230–420 m depth interval. 2.2 Sample pre-treatment and GC–MS analysis The samples (150 g each) were powdered (187.5 μm) and extracted with dichloromethane/methanol (93:7) in a Soxhlet apparatus for 70 h, and the solvent removed by distillation. The extracts were condensed and weighed. Because the extracted material was only 1–5 mg, fractionation using chromatography on silica gel or alumina was avoided to prevent the potential loss of components such as the trace alkanes and the O compound. After natural air-drying and dilution using chloroform, the total extracts were analysed directly using GC–MS. The blank samples were run under similar conditions. The GC–MS spectra showed that the lipid molecules to be discussed in this paper were not found in the blanks. GC–MS analysis was performed using a HP 5973 MSD interfaced to a HP 6890 gas chromatograph fitted with a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. fused silica capillary column coated with a film (0.25 μm) of 5% phenyl-methyl-DB-5. For routine GC analysis, the oven was programmed from 80 to 300 °C at 3 °C/min with an initial and final hold time of 1 min and 30 min, respectively. Helium was used as carrier gas at a linear velocity of 32 cm/s, with the injector operating at a constant flow of 0.9 mL/min. The MS was operated with an ionisation energy of 70 eV, a source temperature of 230 °C and an electron multiplier voltage of 1900 V over a range of 35–550 Dalton. 2.3 Total organic carbon content and its isotopes Sediment samples were dried, powdered and leached with 12% HCl to remove carbonates. Samples were subsequently rinsed with distilled water to neutral pH, and were then dried and homogenised. Total organic C (TOC) contents were determined on a LECO CS-344 carbon/sulfur analyser. The organic C was oxidised to CO 2 in a 850 °C furnace filled with CuO oxidant, and the CO 2 collected for C isotope measurement with the MAT-252 Mass Spectrometer. Isotopic measurements had a standard deviation of 0.2‰ allowing for fluctuations higher than 0.5‰ to be interpreted. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Distribution characteristics of even carbon-numbered n -alkanes A variety of lipids, including n -alkanes, isoprenoids and n -fatty acid methyl esters were identified from the samples ( Table 1 ). The TOC content was relatively low, ranging from 0.03% to 0.08%, averaging 0.05%, and the amount of extracts from 100-g mudstone samples was between 6.6 mg and 12.4 mg, averaging 8.5 mg. Although the n -alkanes in all the samples comprised a series of relatively abundant components ranging from n -C 14 to n -C 35 , the even C-numbered alkanes were concentrated in the range from n -C 16 to n -C 20 with a maximum at n -C 18 ( Fig. 2 ). Calculated OEP 16–20 values ranged from 0.34 to 0.66 and had an average value of 0.54, indicating a strong even C-number predominance ( Table 1 ). Similarly, the distribution of odd C-numbered alkanes is limited in the range of n -C 27 – n -C 31 , with a maximum value occurring at n -C 29 . Calculated OEP 27–31 values were between 1.20 and 2.45 and the average value was 1.43, again indicating a strong odd C-number predominance ( Table 1 ). Thus, all samples exhibited a characteristic n -alkane profile consisting of a bimodal distribution centred at n -C 16 – n -C 20 and n -C 27 – n -C 31 . The mass chromatogram of n -alkanes of representative samples is shown in Fig. 3 . Abundant n -fatty acid methyl esters were detected in all samples and the mass chromatogram of the aliphatic fraction in each sample showed that the esters ranged from n -C 16 to C 32 and exhibited a predominance of even C-numbers with a maximum at n -C 16 . The mass chromatogram of n -fatty acid methyl esters of representative samples is shown in Fig. 4 . Climate parameters and geochemical data are displayed in Table 1 . 3.2 Possible source and environmental significance of even carbon-numbered n -alkanes The predominance of even C-numbered n -alkanes, especially those ranging from n -C 16 – n -C 20 to n -C 18 , is unique in the studied samples. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of the predominance of even C-numbers in alkanes in a continuous lacustrine-sedimentary section. The predominance of the odd C-numbers in the range of n -C 27 – n -C 35 , with a maximum value at n -C 29 , is typical of immature hydrocarbons from terrestrial plant wax ( Eglinton and Hamilton, 1967; Simoneit, 1977a,b; Elias et al., 1997 ). However, the predominance of even C-numbered n -alkanes in sediments is uncommon. Many sources of even C-numbered n -alkanes have been attributed to special sources found under different geological conditions and suggest a microbial origin. There are three possible sources of these n -alkanes with this unusual C-number. One is the microbial alteration of algal detritus. The second is a reductive process acting on alkanoic acids or other lipid compounds. The third is a direct microbial input ( Welte and Ebhardt, 1968; Welte and Waples, 1973; Dembicki et al., 1976; Simoneit, 1977a,c, 1994; Grimalt et al., 1986; Nishimura and Baker, 1986 ). For example, a slight predominance of even C-numbers or smooth distributions in the n -C 20 – n -C 30 range have been attributed to reductive processes in highly saline, carbonate environments that were generated from the remains of algal communities ( Dembicki et al., 1976 ). The predominance of even C-numbered alkenes in the range from n -C 12:1 to n -C 18:1 in recent sediments has been linked with the presence of unsaturated fatty acids, indicators of recent biogenesis ( Simoneit, 1980 ) and has often been found in recent sediments with the occurrence of specific inputs from organisms, such as bacteria and diatoms ( Ten Haven et al., 1985; Nishimura and Baker, 1986; Grimalt and Albaigés, 1987 . As shown in Table 1 , the ratios of pristine (Pr) to phytane (Ph) in all samples were between 0.5 and 1.0. This is thought to be due to weak oxidation–reduction environments, suggesting that environments in the lacustrine sediments may have been favourable for reductive processes involving the production of n -alkanes from fatty acids ( Welte and Ebhardt, 1968; Simoneit, 1977a ). Distributions of n -alkanes with maximum values at n -C 16 or n -C 18 have been found in anoxic marine environments or in areas where a post-depositional reduction of algal fatty acid has been thought to occur ( Simoneit, 1977a ). After examining the n -fatty acid methyl esters derived from the esterification of carboxylicacids, it is suggested that n -fatty acid methyl esters could be the source for the n -alkanes. However, the distribution patterns of n -fatty acid methyl esters in the sedimentary samples examined here ( Fig. 4 ) were very different from those of the corresponding n -alkanes ( Fig. 2 ). The n -fatty acid methyl esters ranged from n -C 16 to n -C 32 and were dominated by n -C 16 n -fatty acids. Thus, it was not possible to correlate the source of n -alkanes that showed a strong predominance of even C-numbers with the corresponding n -fatty acids. Direct biogenic contributions are potential sources for n -alkanes with a predominance of even number carbons. Several reports have shown that it is relatively common for bacteria to produce n -alkanes in the n -C 14 – n -C 22 range with predominance of even number carbons ( Davis, 1968; Jones, 1969; Jones and Young, 1970; Naccarato et al., 1974; Han et al., 1980; Grimalt et al., 1985, 1986; Nishimura and Baker, 1986; Grimalt and Albaigés, 1987; Ekpo et al., 2005 ). Many species of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi, yeast) produce even C-numbered n -alkanes in the range n -C 12 to n -C 22 . Grimalt and Albaigés (1987) showed the unusual distribution of C 12 –C 22 n -alkanes with a strong even C-numbered preference in recent and ancient sediments, which include marine, brackish and fresh water environments, from anoxic depositional conditions. Furthermore, the distribution of n -C 15 – n -C 22 n -alkanes with a strong even-numbered predominance has been identified in coals, rocky coals and coal seam samples formed in a paralic environment ( Grimalt et al., 1986 ). Recent research has indicated a high abundance of even-numbered n -alkanes ( n -C 12 – n -C 26 , with a maximum at n -C 18 , n -C 20 and n -C 22 ) in lacustrine sediments and coastal soils ( Ekpo et al., 2005 ) and the occurrence of short chain n -alkanes with an even over odd predominance in higher plants and soils ( Kuhn et al., 2010 ). These hydrocarbon mixtures are, therefore, thought to be produced in a more complicated sedimentary system instead of specific reactions occurring in isolated sedimentary environments. As shown in Table 1 , the ratios of Pr/ n -C 17 and Ph/ n -C 18 in all samples are low and range from 0.17 to 0.3 and from 0.15 to 0.37, respectively, from strong microbial activities ( González-Vila et al., 2003 ). The Rc% (the vitrinite reflectance, calculated from phenanthrene and methyl phenanthrene) ranged between 0.62 and 0.73 with an average value of 0.69 ( Table 1 ). These results were consistent with the low maturity of organic matter in the study area. Thus, it is inferred that the hydrocarbons in the study area have an autochthonous source. Molecular organic geochemistry has also demonstrated that the ratio of n -C 27 / n -C 31 of n -alkanes is indicative of the relative proportion of wood plants to grass vegetation ( Cranwell et al., 1987; Meyers and Ishiwatari, 1993; Xie and Evershed, 2001; Xie et al., 2003c ). A high ratio of these alkanes indicates change from a humid to arid climate. As shown in Fig. 5 , the average ratio of n -C 27 / n -C 31 for MG15 to MG20 is approximately 0.89 (<1). This low ratio indicates a predominant contribution of grass vegetation, suggesting a relatively continuous arid climate condition in the deposition of the top section from approximately 6.5 to 4.4 Ma. The average ratio of n -C 27 / n -C 31 for MG9 and MG14 is 1.30 (>1), and a high ratio indicates the predominant contribution of wood plants. The deposition of the bottom section from approximately 7.8 Ma to approximately 6.7 Ma occurred under a relatively humid climate condition. It is surprising that the ratio of n -C 27 / n -C 31 for MG7 to MG8 at ∼8 Ma shows a striking change from high to low (1.34–0.84, as shown in Table 1 ). This suggests a large input of grass vegetation after the distinct change to a dry climate at approximately 8 Ma. The results agree with previous observations that the desertification of central Asia was dated at approximately 8 Ma on the eastern Loess Plateau ( Sun et al., 1998; Ding et al., 1999 ). The average ratio of n -C 27 / n -C 31 tends to be high (1.1) for MG1 to MG 7, suggesting that the deposition of the bottom section occurred between approximately 13 Ma and 8 Ma under relatively continuous humid climate conditions. It is important to note that the OEP 16–20 values representing the even C-number predominance of n -alkanes in lacustrine sediments of the Maogou section changed through the section under different climate conditions. As shown in Fig. 5 , the average ratio of OEP 16–20 in the samples from MG15 to MG20 was 0.47 with an obvious change from a high to a low ratio. A characteristic profile of n -alkanes with a strong even C-number predominance was observed at the top of section from approximately 6.5 Ma to 4.4 Ma. The average ratio of OEP 16–20 of MG9 to MG14 samples was 0.56. This relatively high value indicates that there is a weak even C-number predominance of alkanes from approximately 7.8 Ma to 6.7 Ma. After approximately 8 Ma, the OEP 16–20 from MG7 to MG8 samples also showed a sharp change from high to low (0.66–0.43, Table 1 ), indicating a change from a weak to a strong even C-number predominance at approximately 8 Ma. The average ratio of OEP 16–20 was high (0.6) from MG1 to MG 7 between approximately 13 Ma and 8 Ma which exhibits the occurrence of a relative weak even C-number predominance at the bottom of the section. The ratios of n -C 27 / n -C 31 and OEP 16–20 in the studied section indicate that there was a clear relationship between humid-arid climatic conditions and the predominant even C-numbered n -alkanes. A strong even C-number predominance from approximately 6.5 to 4.4 Ma and at approximately 8 Ma corresponded to an arid period. In contrast, a weak even C-number predominance from approximately 7.8 Ma to approximately 6.7 Ma and from approximately 13 Ma to approximately 8 Ma was closely related to humid environments. Therefore, it is proposed that a change in the regional climate from arid to humid is reflected in the transition of a strong to a weak predominance in even C-number n -alkanes. Based on the above discussion, it is suggested that the origins of even C-numbered n -alkanes in the lacustrine sediments in the study area may have been derived from certain special autochthonous bacteria. These bacteria may have had a high reproduction rate under the weak oxic–anoxic and arid environments. Similar observations for the predominant even C-numbered n -alkanes reflected the climate difference between warm-arid regions and cold-humid regions in sediments as observed by Grimalt and Albaigés (1987) . Consequently, the finding that even C-number alkanes were predominant in continuous lacustrine-sedimentary sections due to a change to a dry climate is significant for palaeoclimate reconstruction. 3.3 Stable carbon isotopic compositions of TOC in lacustrine sediments The changes in the δ 13 C values of TOC in modern soils reflect changes in the ratio of C 4 /C 3 plant input ( Cerling, 1984; Cayet and Lichtfouse, 2001 ). The changes in the relative abundance of C 3 and C 4 plants may provide important clues into palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions. The tissues of C 3 plants have δ 13 C values ranging from −20‰ to −32‰, whereas those of C 4 plants range from −9‰ to −17‰ ( Denies, 1980 ). Because of the large C isotopic differences between C 3 and C 4 plants, the isotopic composition of soil organic matter can be readily used to differentiate input from C 3 and C 4 plants ( Liu et al., 2005 ). Table 1 shows stable C isotopic compositions of TOC in the sedimentary samples. Their δ 13 C values ranged from –26.8 to –23.6‰, suggesting that C 3 plants are likely important contributors to organic compounds in the sediments. As shown in Fig. 5 , the heaviest values were obtained in MG7, MG8 and MG9, whose corresponding δ 13 C values are −23.6‰, −24.4‰ and −23.9‰, respectively, indicating a relatively arid climatic condition at approximately 8 Ma. This is consistent with the observation that C 4 plants are suppressed in drier climate zones ( Liu et al., 2005 ). A sharp decrease in the OEP 16–20 value and in δ 13 C enrichment of the organic matter of the studied section at approximately 8 Ma suggests that there is a relationship between the arid environment and a strong even C-number predominance. Unlike the soil organic matter, which contains little material from lower organisms such as algae and can be directly used to estimate changes in C 3 and C 4 plants, organic matter in lake sediments may be derived from both terrestrial and lacustrine organisms ( Street-Perrott et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1999 ). Thus, organic compounds in the lacustrine environment might not be directly derived from C 3 plants, but may have been modified by aquatic bacteria in the lake. The ratios of σ n C 21 - / σ n C 22 + in n -alkanes reflect the relative proportion of low organisms, such as bacteria and algae, to high plants ( Xie et al., 1999, 2003c; Xie and Evershed, 2001; Wang et al., 2003 ). As shown in Table 1 , the average ratios of σ n C 21 - / σ n C 22 + were higher than samples in MG7, MG8 and MG9 (which had corresponding values of 1.65, 1.80, and 1.95, respectively), suggesting that bacteria and algae were the primary origins for lacustrine sediments in warm-arid climate conditions. Further, the ratio of σ n C 21 - / σ n C 22 + increases gradually at the top of the section (from MG18 to MG 20) with relatively light δ 13 C values ( Fig. 5 ), indicating that the δ 13 C values of TOC may be affected by the input of low organisms, such as bacteria and algae. This further suggests that bacteria and algae were the sources for lacustrine sediments with the retreat of the palaeolake level under warm-arid climate conditions. Thus, the C isotopic ratio of TOC is a potential geochemical proxy in the lacustrine section. 4 Conclusions A suite of n -alkanes with a strong even C-number predominance are consistently found in the continuous lacustrine-sedimentary section in Linxia Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau. The comparison of the distribution of n -alkanes and n -fatty acid methyl esters allows ruling out the possibility that such n -alkane characteristics are produced diagenetically from the corresponding n -fatty acids. Various geochemical parameters, such as low Pr/ n -C 17 , Ph/ n -C 18 ratios, indicate that there are strong microbial activities in sediments and that these sediments might have originated directly from autochthonous microorganisms. The low Pr/Ph in all samples of sedimentary sections further suggest that weak oxic–anoxic environments are favourable to the growth of certain bacterial flora, which are able to produce n -alkanes with a high predominance of even C-numbers. A close correspondence between the low ratio of n -C 27 / n -C 31 , the heavy δ 13 C values of TOC and a strong even C-number predominance (low OEP 16–20 values) from approximately 6.5 to 4.4 Ma and at approximately 8 Ma in the studied section suggests that n -alkanes with a high predominance of even C-numbers may be treated as geochemical proxies for arid climate.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Xining Basin is well known for its thick and continuous sequence of fine-grained Cenozoic sediments. In addition, it contains important Xiejia fauna which define the Xiejian Stage of the early Miocene in the standard Chinese land mammal zonation, and it also provides detailed histories of eolian dust deposition which document the aridification of Asia, monsoon evolution and the initiation of the Yellow River in relation to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. However, the results of magnetostratigraphic dating of the fossil-bearing sequence has yielded conflicting ages for the fauna and stratigraphy, hindering the use of the sequence for addressing major paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic issues. Here, we review the paleontological, lithological and magnetostratigraphic record of the Xining Basin and provide a new, long and continuous high-resolution magnetostratigraphy from the basin center. The results show that the observed magnetic polarity zones from the various sections at different sites in the basin exhibit similar magnetic polarity patterns which can be readily correlated, in terms of both magnetic polarity zonation and lithofacies; in addition, they show that the sedimentary sequence of the basin was sub-continuously deposited from ~54 Ma to 4.8 Ma. The magnetostratigraphic correlations confirm previous constraint of the Xiejia fauna in the late Oligocene at ~25 Ma, challenging the current Chinese mammal land zonation for the early Miocene, and we suggest that it provides a superior record of eolian dust deposition and river incision in the late Pliocene than previous studies. There is a close match of the climatic proxy records of the Xiejia section, dated by magnetostratigraphy, with the global climatic record which corroborates the paleomagnetic correlations. The evolution of the sedimentary environment provided by the lithofacies demonstrates a complete cycle of basin formation and termination, which records the eastern Qilian Shan experienced three main phases of uplifts: slow episodic uplifts at ~54 Ma and 22.5 Ma and a late rapid episodic uplifts at 8–7 Ma and since 4.8–3.6 Ma. This tectonic uplift in the NE Tibetan Plateau was mostly nearly synchronous responses to the initial and continuing collision of India and Asia since ~50 ± 5 Ma.",

        "abstract": "Continental aridification and the intensification of the monsoons in Asia are generally attributed to uplift of the Tibetan plateau and to the land-sea redistributions associated with the continental collision of India and Asia, whereas some studies suggest that past changes in Asian environments are mainly governed by global climate. The most dramatic climate event since the onset of the collision of India and Asia is the Eocene-Oligocene transition, an abrupt cooling step associated with the onset of glaciation in Antarctica 34 million years ago. However, the influence of this global event on Asian environments is poorly understood. Here we use magnetostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy to show that aridification, which is indicated by the disappearance of playa lake deposits in the northeastern Tibetan plateau, occurred precisely at the time of the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Our findings suggest that this global transition is linked to significant aridification and cooling in continental Asia recorded by palaeontological and palaeoenvironmental changes, and thus support the idea that global cooling is associated with the Eocene-Oligocene transition. We show that, with sufficient age control on the sedimentary records, global climate can be distinguished from tectonism and recognized as a major contributor to continental Asian environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau (TP) has long been regarded as one of major factors accounting for both the enhanced process of aridification recorded in central Asia and the shifts in the Asian monsoonal circulations that are known to have occurred at approximately 8 Ma. Until now, there have been few sedimentary records reported on which can directly, and in an integrated fashion, shed light on the regionu0027s tectonic and climate regimes. This can be largely attributed to the fact that the influence exerted by the presence of source materials and subsequent sedimentary sorting in this tectonically active region would be likely to bias significantly any paleoclimatic interpretation of silicate-derived proxies. Based on detailed investigations of strontium (Sr) distributions revealed by multi-step leaching in a fluvial sequence from the Linxia Basin which includes paleosols, we reconstructed the long-term late Miocene regional climatic and environmental changes likely to have occurred on the northeastern TP from 12.1 to 5.2 Ma. We investigated Sr-related proxies in two typical paleosol profiles to constrain Sr mobility in paleosol weathering, and, thus, to further prompt the interpretation of Sr-related proxies along the whole section. We would suggest that carbonate-derived Sr concentrations and Sr/Ca ratios are suitable proxies for tracing regional climate change associated with weathering and pedogenesis; together, they exhibit weakened chemical weathering intensity and pedogenesis at ~ 8.6 Ma. The concomitant appearance of immature sediments through poor sedimentary sorting revealed by silicate-derived Rb/Sr,  87 Sr/ 86 Sr and Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu*) alongside a sharp increase in sedimentation rates noted at this time suggests that it was indeed tectonic uplift that principally controlled the dramatic climatic and environmental changes. This multi-proxy record of concomitant tectonic uplift and climate change in the Linxia Basin provides direct geological evidence for uplift driven climate change in the northeastern TP region.",

However, the timing and structure of the MPT is still an open question both in marine and land sediments. In order to identify and explore the existence of MPT in terrestrial aeolian sediments, we carried out high-resolution rock magnetic analyses on aeolian loess sediments in the central Loess Plateau, North China. The results show that the MPT occurred at 0.93Ma and ended at 0.62Ma. This transition event maybe related to the aggravation of dry, the forming and expanding of desert in Asian interior triggered by the uplift of the Tibetan plateau besides global ice volume and solar insolation.",

Through high-resolution particle size analysis of the oldest loess-red clay sequence known so far (with a basal age of about 8 Ma) and comparison of the results with oxygen isotope curves from North Atlantic marine sediments, 4 stages of the evolution of the Asian winter monsoon were clearly demonstrated. During the first stage, between about 8.1 and 4.3 Ma, there was no relation between Asian winter monsoon and Northern Hemisphere ice volume and high latitude climate inferred from marine sediments. A weak relation developed during the second stage, about 4.3 to 3.5 Ma. During the third stage (3.5 to 2.6 Ma) an Asian winter monsoon system similar to the present formed, initiating a stronger relation between the winter monsoon and Northern Hemisphere ice volume and high latitude climate. In the final stage (2.6 to 0 Ma) the present Asian winter monsoon system was fortified and stabilized and changes in the winter monsoon system were almost in phase with Northern Hemisphere ice volume and climate. The staggered uplift of Tibetan Plateau at Ο8, 3.6, 2.6 Ma and later might be the driving force for the evolution of the Asian winter monsoon.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in innate immunity, serving as pattern-recognition receptors and the first barrier in host defense against microbial infections. Genetic variations of TLR2 and TLR4 are closely associated with a variety of infectious diseases, particularly lung diseases. In this study, we detected six and four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding sequences of porcine TLR2 and TLR4 genes, respectively. Only SNP 1027C>A of TLR4 was shown to be markedly biased in Western and Oriental pig populations. Hence, the susceptibility of pigs with different genotype at position 1027C>A to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp) infection was investigated, and changes to the expression of TLR2, TLR4, TNF-α and IL-1β were monitored. The results showed that there was no significant difference in susceptibility to Mhp infection between AA and CC individuals despite expression levels for all detected genes of the challenge groups being significantly higher than the corresponding control groups. Furthermore, porcine alveolar macrophages of different genotype were collected and stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. We found that the expression of TLR2, TLR4, TNF-α and IL-1β genes were enhanced to different levels by lipopolysaccharide stimulation. TLR2 and TLR4 gene expressions and their rates of increase of 1027CC pigs were significantly higher than for 1027AC pigs (P < 0.01), while TNF-α and IL-1β expressions were significantly lower than for 1027AC pigs (P < 0.01). We predict that allele C at position 1027 of the TLR4 gene contributes to the pig's immune response to gram-negative bacterial infections.",

        "abstract": "The widely distributed thick gravel deposits along the rim of the Tibetan Plateau have been long thought to be the product\n of rapid tectonic uplift of the plateau. However, this has been challenged by recent works that suggest these thick gravels\n may be the result of climate change. In this paper we carried out a detailed field measurement of gravel grain sizes from\n the Jiuquan and Gobi Gravel Beds in the top of the Laojunmiao section in the Jiuxi Basin in the northern margin of Qilian\n Mts. (northern Tibetan Plateau). The results suggest that the grain sizes of the Jiuquan and Gobi Gravel Beds over the last\n 0.8 Ma are characterized by nine coarse-fine cycles having strong 100-ka and 41-ka periodicities that correlate well with\n the loess-paleosol monsoon record and isotopic global climatic record from deep sea sediments as well as by a long trend of\n coarsening in gravel grain size. The coarse gravel layers were formed during the warm-humid interglaciations while the fine\n layers correspond to the cold-dry glaciations. Because the paleoclimate in NW China began to get dramatically drier after\n the mid-Pleistocene, we think the persistent coarsening of gravel grain size was most probably caused by the rapid uplift\n of the northern Tibetan Plateau, and that the orbital scale cyclic variations in gravel grain size were driven by orbital\n forcing factors that were superimposed on the tectonically-forced long-term coarsening trend in gravel size. These findings\n also shed new light on the interaction results of climate and tectonics in relation to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.",

        "abstract": "A 3-Ma pollen record was obtained from a continuous red clay–loess–paleosol sequence at Chaona in the central Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). The record shows a permanent change of a domination of typical Cupressaceae forest vegetation representative of an ecological environment with a relative warm and humid climate during 3.0–2.6 Ma to largely steppe vegetation under dry climate conditions after 2.6 Ma. The later is further manifested itself as steppe to forest or forest–steppe (spruce forest — mostly mesophilous herbs) between 2.6 Ma and 1.5 Ma, forest–steppe (pine–grass) between 1.5 Ma and 0.95 Ma, open forest–steppe (mesophilous and xeromorphic herbs–pine) between 0.95 Ma and 0.5 Ma, and steppe (xeromorphic herbs) after 0.5 Ma, suggesting a process of stepwise aridification in Central Asia at the late Pliocene and the Quaternary.",

Then the hydrolysis and polycondensationreactions of siloxane units are performed and benzoxazine bearing polysiloxanes (BS-PSO) is obtained. The ring-opening polymerization reactions of both BS-b and BS-PSO are studied by FTIR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in nonisothermal conditions. The kinetics of the polymerization of BS-b is found to be well described by using an nth-order kinetic model for n = 0.7 (activation energy = 141 kJ∙mol−1). The BS-PSO is also used to modify bisphenol-A-based benzoxazines (BA-a), and the morphological structure and thermal properties of the copolymer are investigated. The thermogravimetric analysis results indicate that the silane-functional polybenzoxazines display enhanced initial decomposition temperature and char yields in comparison with the poly(BA-a). These results are believed to be important for the development of new flame-retardant laminates.",

        "abstract": "The formation and development of the arid climate in High Asia remain controversial. This is largely because of the scarcity of continuous high-resolution geological records from the Asian interior region. Thick loess sequences deposited on the surface of the Tibetan Plateau and its rims provide great potential to reconstruct a high-resolution history of the formation and evolution of High Asia arid climate. Based on detailed investigations of the grain size and carbonate content of representative loess sequences in High Asia, a persistent drying of High Asia occurred in the past 1Ma, and two major rapid drying events occurred at about 0.9-0.8Ma and 0.5Ma. Persistent and rapid stepwise uplifts of the Tibetan Plateau since the Mid-Pleistocene might play a dominant role in the drying of High Asia, although the Mid-Pleistocene global cooling may partially contribute to the event. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",

        "title": "Climatic variation in the Linxia basin, NE Tibetan Plateau, from 13.1 to 4.3 Ma: The stable isotope record",
        "abstract": "The δ 13 C and δ 18 O values of carbonates and δ 13 C org values, % C, and C/N ratios of organic matter from lacustrine and fluvial sediments were measured from two stratigraphic sections in the Linxia basin on the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Diagenesis, when present, is early, limited to small spatial scales and restricted stratigraphic intervals. A strong correlation exists between dolomite content and the δ 18 O values of micritic carbonate suggesting that carbonates are primary precipitates from lake water and that δ 18 O values reflect changes in the lake environment, with more positive values derived from evaporated and more saline lake water. The first part of this record is characterized by strong oscillations between dry and wet conditions accompanied by changes in the lake system between hydrographically closed and open states (13.1–8.0 Ma). The most severe aridity occurred from 9.6 to 8.5 Ma. After ∼ 8.0 Ma, a more stable and less arid climate dominated the region and the drainage system was open (8.0–5.3 Ma). After 5.3 Ma, climate became gradually drier and/or cooler (5.3–4.3 Ma). The organic matter preserved in the Linxia basin is most likely a mixture of terrestrial C 3 plant matter and lake algae. A correlation between C/N and δ 13 C org indicates that a significant percentage of the organic matter is derived from terrestrial sources. The organic matter has undergone selective degradation during which the C/N ratios and organic carbon percentage decreased. The δ 13 C org values are relatively stable throughout the 13.1 to 4.3 Ma interval ranging from − 24 to − 29‰ VPDB, suggesting that C 4 grasses were either absent or insignificant in the Linxia region prior to 4.3 Ma. Keywords Linxia basin Oxygen isotope Organic matter Diagenesis Tibetan Plateau 1 Introduction Long-term climate records from marine environments reveal important trends in global climate throughout the Cenozoic: cooling since the late Cretaceous, warming in the Eocene and then a progressive step-wise cooling, more pronounced since the mid-Miocene, culminating in the glacial/interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene (e.g., Rea et al., 1998; Lear et al., 2000; Zachos et al., 2001; Billups and Schrag, 2002; Zheng et al., 2004 ). The δ 18 O and Mg/Ca records of benthic foraminifers show a general cooling trend since the mid-Miocene, thought to be driven by the growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet and subsequent cooling of Antarctic Bottom Water ( Lear et al., 2000; Zachos et al., 2001; Billups and Schrag, 2002 ). In East Asia, climate change since the mid-Miocene is particularly interesting since it is a critical period in the history of uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. Currently most of the climate records in this region are from eolian Red Clay and loess sequences, which have yielded high-resolution climate records spanning the last ∼ 8 Ma ( An et al., 2001; Ding et al., 2001 ). Climate records prior to 8 Ma are rare in this region, due to the apparent lack of older continuous loess deposits (see, however, Fan et al., 2006 ) while the eolian record mostly reflects climate change in the loess source region, i.e. the sandy deserts of northwestern China ( Sun, 2002 ). Lake systems are excellent potential archives of climatically responsive sediments where geochemical tracers can be used to reconstruct long-term (million-year) climate records. The stable isotope geochemistry of organic matter and authigenic carbonate in lake sediments can be a sensitive proxy of environmental and hydrological changes driven by climate variation ( Meyers and Benson, 1988; Last, 1990; Talbot, 1990; Dean and Stuiver, 1993; Meyers and Ishiwatari, 1993; Drummond et al., 1995; Li and Ku, 1997; Meyers, 1994, 1997; Kashiwaya et al., 2001; Meyers, 2003 ). The northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau holds good potential for this kind of study, as it is an area where foreland basins have collected sediment over much of the Cenozoic ( Métivier et al., 1998; Fang et al., 2003; Horton et al., 2004 ). The lake deposits filling these basins preserve both organic matter from the lake environment and terrestrial plant matter within the lake drainage system. In addition, they contain authigenic carbonate precipitated from lake water. If major diagenetic alteration can be ruled out for the lake sediments, we should be able to use these techniques to provide a record of environmental and climatic change at the northwestern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. In this paper, we studied two outcrop sections in the Linxia basin on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, focusing on the stable isotope geochemistry of sediments in the basin. Dettman et al. (2003) reported a lower resolution carbonate isotope record of the Maogou section covering the last 29 Ma in the Linxia basin. They concluded that there was a significant shift in the δ 18 O of meteoric water in the basin sometime between 13 and 12 Ma, which was most likely the result of uplift of some portion of the Tibetan Plateau to an elevation that blocked Pacific or Indian Ocean moisture from reaching the region north-east of the plateau. Our study focuses on the post 13.1 Ma record and significantly increases the sample density over that of Dettman et al. (2003) . Our results provide a long-term climate and environmental history for northwestern China from the middle Miocene into the early Pliocene (13.1 to 4.3 Ma). The similarity of this record to some major features in the marine stable isotope record derived from benthic foraminifera suggests that the reconstruction is not merely a local record, but reflects broad regional and/or global climate change. 2 Regional setting, climate and stratigraphy Located 100 km southwest of the city of Lanzhou, the Linxia basin is at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau and on the western margin of the Loess Plateau. To the north lie the deserts of west/central China and Inner Mongolia ( Fig. 1 ). The basin is ∼ 200 km long and 75 km wide at a current elevation of 2–2.6 km. The oldest documented sedimentary rocks in the basin are ∼ 29 Ma old and the sedimentary package is more than 1 km thick. The basin fill thins and pinches out at the Maxian Shan to the northeast ( Fang et al., 1995, 2003 ). Southwest of the Linxia basin, the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is delineated by the western Qinling mountains, which are made up of Devonian through Permian metasedimentary terrestrial and marine deposits and plutons of Early Paleozoic and Late Paleozoic–Early Mesozoic age ( Garzione et al., 2005 and references therein). On the northern edge of Linxia basin, the Maxian Shan is underlain by Jurassic to Paleocene terrestrial deposits ( Gansu Geologic Bureau, 1989 ). The basin is elongate parallel to the fold thrust belt on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Subsidence history and stratigraphic studies of three measured sections show that the Linxia basin was formed under flexural loading during the thickening of the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau between ∼ 29 and 6 Ma. Between ∼ 8 and 6 Ma the basin was incorporated into the deformation front of the Tibetan Plateau ( Fang et al., 2003 ). The modern climate in northwest China is semi-arid continental with the annual average temperature in the city of Linxia (near the center of the basin) of 6.7 °C, and an average monthly maximum temperature (in July) of 18 °C. The average annual precipitation is 500 mm with more than 85% from summer monsoon precipitation ( http://www.weatherbase.com ). The East Asian summer monsoon brings warm moist air from the Pacific, while the cold and dry Asian winter monsoon dominates in winter. Our stable isotope records come from two sections, at Wangjiashan (WJS) and at Maogou. WJS is along the southwest edge of the basin, near the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, whereas the Maogou section is near the geographical center of the basin ( Fig. 2 ). The Maogou section and the upper 500 m of WJS are well dated based on strata contain fossil mammals and two paleomagnetic polarity studies ( Fang et al., 1995, 2003 ). The most recent magnetostratigraphy study sampled the Maogou section at 0.5–1 m intervals and WJS at 2 m intervals ( Fang et al., 2003 ). The stratigraphy in the Linxia basin during the 13.1 and 4.4 Ma interval covered by this study is divided into three formations based on lithofacies and paleontological evidence: the Dongxiang Formation (13.1–7.8 Ma), the Liushu Formation (7.8–6.2 Ma), and the Hewangjia Formation (6.2–4.3 Ma) ( Fang et al., 1995, 2003 ). Sedimentary facies analysis shows that the depositional environment at the measured section localities evolved from deltaic (13.1–11.0 Ma) to lacustrine (11.0–6.2 Ma) ( Fan et al., 2006 ). The lacustrine sediments are characterized by many discrete white to gray marls with thicknesses ranging from 2 to 20 cm. These carbonates have been interpreted as primary precipitates from lake water which was supersaturated with respect to carbonate ( Dettman et al., 2003; Garzione et al., 2004 ). A detailed grain-size study of the Maogou section shows that after 6.0 Ma, eolian sediments dominate the flood-plain deposition at the Maogou section, while lacustrine deposition continues irregularly in the WJS ( Fan et al., 2006 ) ( Fig. 2 ). 3 Sampling and experimental methods Carbonate-rich mudstone/siltstone, dolomitic marls, calcitic marls and mixed marls were taken from fresh outcrops of the upper WJS and the Maogou section ( Fig. 2 ). The ages assigned to sediments were derived from the linear interpolation between geomagnetic polarity reversals ( Fang et al., 1995, 2003 ). Reworked Permian/Triassic-age limestone clasts from fluvial channel deposits and modern soil carbonate (forming under granite cobbles in a soil zone) at 3.4 km elevation on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau were also collected for carbonate isotope analysis. Sampling occurred at two different time scales. First, we focused on a high-resolution study of millimeter-to-centimeter scale isotope variation within the typical carbonate-dominated layers. We sampled shell fragments, void fillings, carbonate inter-clast cement and reworked limestone clasts in gravels, detrital carbonate clasts, detrital clay-rich clasts and secondary veins in siltstone, mudstone, and micritic marls. For this work, only carbonate oxygen and carbon isotope values were analyzed. A second sample set was collected for a relatively low-resolution study of isotopic trends through time. The resolution of this sample set is controlled by the presence of carbonate sediments in the measured section. Data collected for the low-resolution study include, carbonate isotope ratios, organic carbon isotopes (δ 13 C org ), organic carbon content (% C) and C org /N total ratios (C/N) of the bulk organic matter. Organic matter data were not produced for the WJS section. Polished thin sections were prepared from two fairly typical, weakly lithified, micritic marls (MG252 and MG362) cut perpendicular to the horizontal plane of sedimentary bedding. The two samples were examined petrographically and high-resolution samples were taken across the vertical cross-section. Selected samples were also powdered for X-ray diffraction, which was performed with a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, and the carbonate mineralogy was determined based on the position of the d(104) peak. MG 362 is calcitic, whereas MG 252 is a mix of dolomite and low magnesium calcite. The δ 13 C and δ 18 O values of carbonates were measured using the method described in Dettman et al. (2003) . The precision of repeated standards is ± 0.12‰ for δ 18 O and ± 0.09‰ for δ 13 C (1 σ ). For the analysis of δ 13 C org values, % C, % N and C/N ratios, samples were reacted with 10 ml of 10% HCl overnight to remove the carbonate and then washed by distilled water to neutral pH. Carbonate-rich samples were treated twice. The % C, % N and C/N ratios were measured by placing oven-dried samples in tin capsules combusted at 1030 °C in a Costech Elemental Analyzer. Detection limits for the elemental analyzer are 10 μg C and 20 μg N. Uncertainty based on replicates of standard materials at the minimum sample size used for unknowns was 2.7% of total nitrogen content and 1.5% of total carbon content (1 σ ). The δ 13 C org values were measured using a Finnigan Delta Plus XL mass spectrometer that is connected via a Finnigan MAT Conflo III split interface. δ 13 C org values were calibrated using USGS-24 and NBS-22, for which the precision is better than ± 0.1‰ (1 σ ). All carbon isotope results are reported relative to VPDB. 4 Results 4.1 Field observation, petrology and mineralogy Marls in the Dongxiang and Liushu Formations display a sharp contact with the surrounding lacustrine siliciclastic sediments ( Fig. 3 A,B ). They are all clay rich and most contain siliciclastic silts. Most of the marls are massive, and only a few laminated marls were found in the Maogou section. Poorly preserved shell fragments were observed with a hand lens in some of the massive marls in the Dongxiang and Liushu Formations. Thin section study shows that the shell fragments are ostracodes — shell cross-sections with vestibule are clearly visible ( Fig. 3 C). Marls are micritic, with small regions of micrite recrystallization or void filling cements observed in thin sections ( Fig. 3 D). X-ray diffraction shows that low-Mg calcite (LMC) is the dominant carbonate mineral in the marls although some intervals are dominated by dolomite. Mixtures of low-Mg calcite and dolomite are also present ( Fig. 4 ). In fluvial sediments carbonates are primarily matrix cements associated with both eolian silts and occasional sands and gravels. These cements (in the Hewangjia Formation) are low-Mg calcite. 4.2 Carbonate stable isotopes The carbonate isotope record shown for the Maogou section ( Fig. 5 ) is a composite based on samples from the deltaic, lacustrine and fluvial facies. The δ 18 O values in 13.1–8.0 Ma period are characterized by high frequency oscillations between a relatively stable end member around − 9.3‰ and a more variable and more positive end member ranging up to − 1.7‰. The most positive values occur between 9.6 to 8.5 Ma. After 8.0 Ma δ 18 O values are more uniform at around − 8.8‰ up to 5.3 Ma. After 5.3 Ma, the δ 18 O values of LMC carbonates cementing fluvial sediments increase, averaging about − 7.5‰. Between 13.1 and 8.0 Ma there is a strong co-variance between δ 13 C values and δ 18 O values in the lacustrine carbonates, with δ 13 C ranging between − 7.0‰ and − 2.3‰. After 7.8 Ma, δ 13 C values stabilize at around − 5.8‰. They increase slightly to − 5‰ after 5.3 Ma. In the WJS section δ 18 O and δ 13 C values range between − 12.8‰ to − 5.3‰ and − 7.9‰ to − 2.7‰, respectively ( Fig. 6 ). Because sampling density in the WJS section is much lower than in the Maogou section, we cannot make a detailed isotopic comparison. However, the record does show very positive values around 9 Ma, which probably corresponds to the most positive δ 18 O values in the Maogou section at 9.6–8.5 Ma. There is a strong relationship between the δ 18 O values of the carbonate and its mineralogy, with more negative δ 18 O values associated with LMC, the most positive δ 18 O values associated with dolomite, and mixtures associated with intermediate δ 18 O values ( Fig. 7 ). We have not performed XRD on all marl samples, but we suspect that this relationship holds for the lacustrine record. The δ 18 O values of subsamples from laminated marl sample MG252 and massive marl MG362 reveal two different patterns ( Fig. 8 ). In the laminated marl, δ 18 O values vary significantly in different layers, which also follow the mineralogical changes described above (i.e. samples containing dolomite have more positive δ 18 O values). In the massive sample there is little variation in oxygen isotope ratios. 4.3 δ 13 C org , % C and C/N ratios of bulk organic matter The range in organic matter δ 13 C org values is relatively limited, between − 29‰ and − 24‰. With a few exceptions C/N ratios are between 1 and 4 throughout the section although there is a trend toward higher values after 5.3 Ma ( Fig. 5 ). % C is mostly less than 0.3 %. Inorganic nitrogen was not removed from the sediment samples before combustion for measurement of the C/N ratio. Because the content of both organic carbon and nitrogen was extremely low in the study section (typically % N is less than 0.2 %), inorganic nitrogen may play a significant role in measured C/N ratio ( Meyers, 1997, 2003 ). 5 Discussion 5.1 Carbonate diagenesis Stable isotope ratios of unaltered carbonates preserved in lacustrine and fluvial sediments have been used to reconstruct regional temperature, paleoelevation, meteoric water source or evaporation/precipitation ( Last, 1990; Talbot, 1990; Drummond et al., 1995; Li and Ku, 1997; Garzione et al., 2004 ). But before using this approach, one must evaluate diagenesis of the carbonates under study and its possible impact on the original stable isotope geochemistry. There is some evidence for carbonate diagenesis in the Linxia basin. (1), Areas of micrite recrystallization clearly indicate that there is some alteration of carbonate present ( Fig. 3 D). (2), At some stratigraphic levels, carbonates of different morphologies (vein cements, coating cements, micrite, or shell) may have very similar stable isotope values, which could be the result of diagenesis which may cause a homogenization of stable isotope ratios (e.g. MG362 in Fig. 8 , or CHOO10 and MG329 in Table 1 ). (3), Dolomitic marls are present in the Linxia basin lacustrine sediments. Dolomite is often the product of the stabilization of formerly metastable carbonates. Original high-magnesium calcites or “protodolomite” can be replaced by more stable phases, and dolomitization can also occur through the reaction of limestone with basinal brines during deep burial ( Warren, 2000 ). We also note that if diagenesis occurred under modern surface conditions, the resulting δ 18 O value of the diagenetic carbonate would have a very similar value to the − 9 to − 10‰ value that dominates the Miocene/Pliocene record. Modern soil carbonates at an elevation of 3.4 km on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau yielded δ 18 O values ranging from − 9.4 to − 11.2‰ ( Table 1 , Fig. 9 ). The δ 18 O value of the modern summer surface waters in the Linxia basin ranges from − 8.5 to − 10.4‰ (VSMOW) ( Garzione et al., 2004 ). The calculated δ 18 O value of the soil carbonate (calcite) precipitated from modern rainfall is − 7.0 to − 11.3‰ using the standard calcite oxygen isotope fractionation and a temperature between 7 and 18 °C ( Kim and O'Neil, 1997 ). This overlaps with the modern carbonate data suggesting that this soil carbonate, forming on the underside of cobbles, was precipitated from modern rainfall under equilibrium conditions. Note, however, that this possible diagenesis is clearly limited to small stratigraphic intervals. Morphologically, micrite recrystallization is limited to very small areas, shell fragments are preserved with very sharp edges, and the contacts between carbonate layers and siliciclastic sediments tend to be sharp, suggesting the diagenesis has not greatly redistributed carbonate in Linxia. Also we see significant and rapid change in δ 18 O values across the two measured sections and within the 3 cm thick section of MG 252 ( Figs. 5,6,8 ). The multiple large shifts in δ 18 O and δ 13 C values on both the centimeter and meter scale would not be expected to survive regional diagenetic alteration. In addition, dolomites are not always diagenetic in lacustrine systems. Quaternary dolomites with high δ 18 O values are sometimes found in saline lakes or in sediments interpreted as deposited in a closed, saline phase of a lacustrine sedimentary package ( Last, 1990 ). In the Linxia basin, high δ 18 O and δ 13 C values of dolomite-rich lake sediments indicate that lake conditions were very different than that of times when low-magnesium calcites precipitate. The strong correlation of low δ 18 O values with low Mg-calcite and high δ 18 O values with dolomitic micrite would be expected if this lake system was undergoing periodic closure and evaporative enrichment of the lake water ( Fig. 7 ). Evaporation would lead to much more positive δ 18 O values and increased salinity in the lake system, which could lead to dolomite or proto-dolomite formation in waters with elevated δ 18 O values. Although the fractionation between water and dolomite is poorly known at low temperatures, recent work suggests that simple mineralogical differences would explain only 2 to 3‰ of the difference between calcite and dolomite in the lacustrine environment ( Vasconcelos et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 2005 ). The fact that the differences are up to 8‰ suggests that lake water evaporation is also involved ( Fig. 7 ). If dolomite resulted from late, higher temperature, diagenetic alteration of original calcite, we would expect much more negative δ 18 O values, incipient lithification of the sediments, and a more pervasive alteration of all the carbonate beds, not alternating dolomite and low Mg-calcite beds. Therefore the diagenesis observed in the Linxia basin is most likely very early, occurring either shortly after each carbonate layer was deposited or on a very small spatial scale. Early diagenesis, in the presence of lake water or shallow groundwater and at surface temperatures would result in very little modification of the original carbonate oxygen isotope ratios. 5.2 The carbonate stable isotope record Detrital carbonate clasts, probably derived from Carboniferous/Permian limestone, and limestone in the gravels of fluvial channel deposits have δ 18 O and δ 13 C values ranging from − 19.0 to − 8.5‰, and − 7.5 to + 10‰ respectively, generally overlapping with many of the δ 18 O values of authigenic carbonates in Linxia, but in many cases the isotopic values are different than the cementing carbonates around these clasts or in nearby micrites ( Table 1 , Fig. 9 ). The clearest example is the metamorphosed limestone gravels collected from conglomerates, such as CHOO-36 and CHOO-06.6. The very positive δ 13 C and very negative δ 18 O values of some of these gravels relative to authigenic carbonates indicate that most of the detrital limestones have significantly different isotopic compositions than authigenic carbonates they are intimately associated with ( Table 1 , Fig. 9 ). Because care was taken to avoid autochthonous limestone or dolomite in sampling we have minimized the influence of detrital carbonates in Fig. 5 . The variation in δ 18 O values of the lake carbonates cannot be attributed solely to temperature. The calcite fractionation relationship with temperature is such that a change of ∼ 4.3 °C leads to only a 1‰ change in the δ 18 O value of calcite ( Kim and O'Neil, 1997 ). Thus, a change of more than 30 °C would be required to account for the 7‰ variations of the lake carbonate δ 18 O values in the Maogou section, which is very unlikely. The high frequency δ 18 O variation also argues against major changes in the altitude of surrounding regions or continentality as a driver of δ 18 O variability, because these factors, tied to tectonic processes, would not cause short-term change and rapid excursions. Therefore, the relationship between δ 18 O values and carbonate mineralogy in the Linxia basin leads to the idea that more negative δ 18 O values represent open-lake conditions, and more positive δ 18 O values represent closed and evaporative lake conditions. This conclusion is supported by the linear and positive correlation between the δ 18 O and δ 13 C values in the lacustrine facies ( Fig. 10 ). This covariation is expected for a lake switching between open and closed states ( Talbot, 1990; Drummond et al., 1995 ). During open basin conditions, the δ 18 O value of lake water approaches the value of inflowing water, which is usually derived from the rainfall in the basin catchments, perhaps biased toward higher elevations around the basin. Although there is a good deal of variability in the record, δ 18 O values of both marls and cements maintain a value of approximately − 9‰ as the most negative end member between 13.1 and 5.3 Ma in the Maogou section. This − 9‰ value is perhaps tied to the δ 18 O of meteoric water in the Linxia basin. Fresh water input often leads to lower pH conditions in the lake, reducing the alkalinity of the lake, which can lead to more negative δ 13 C values due to vigorous atmospheric exchange or the input of DIC with much more negative δ 13 C values derived from soil carbon oxidation ( Li and Ku, 1997 ). Under closed basin conditions, high evaporation increases alkalinity and the δ 18 O values of lake water increase. Higher δ 13 C values could be the result of high productivity due to high nutrient concentration, or outgassing of CO 2 ( Talbot, 1990 ). A weak covariation is also found in the Linxia basin fluvial facies ( Fig. 10 ) that could also be created by evaporation of the groundwaters of the region. 5.3 C/N ratio, % C, δ 13 C org and selective organic matter degradation The C/N ratio of organic matter in sediments is generally used as an indicator of the source of the organic matter and of the degree of modification from its original state ( Meyers and Benson, 1988 ). Because terrestrial plants are protein-poor and cellulose-rich, the C/N ratio of terrestrial plants is higher than aquatic algae, with C 3 plants typically > 15 and C 4 plants > 35. Fresh-water algae are protein-rich and cellulose-poor, and have C/N ratios between 4 and 10 ( Meyers, 1994, 2003 ). C/N ratios in most of the fine sediments of the Linxia basin are low ( Fig. 5 ), which is usually interpreted as an indicator that the organic material is derived from aquatic primary production. However, in this record there are numerous intervals where the C/N ratio is significantly less than 4, a value that is too low for aquatic algae. Selective degradation of the organic matter during diagenesis can modify the original C/N ratio of organic matter ( Meyers and Ishiwatari, 1993; Meyers, 1994; Sampei and Matsumoto, 2001 ). The C/N ratio of organic matter can decrease during diagenesis ( Muller, 1977; Meyers and Ishiwatari, 1993; Meyers, 1997; Lehmann et al., 2002 ), with loss of organic matter followed by the fixing of inorganic nitrogen as ammonium or nitrate compounds on clays or mineral surfaces, especially when the final organic content of the sediment is very low ( Muller, 1977; Thornton and McManus, 1994; Muller and Mathesius, 1999; Sampei and Matsumoto, 2001 ). The loss of initial organic matter can be very fast in nature ( Eadie et al., 1984; Melillo et al., 1989; Freudenthal et al., 2001 ), and Muller (1977) shows an example of early diagenesis of oxidized pelagic sediments shifting C/N ratios to < 4 in intervals where the % C is < 0.3. Thus, the very low % C in the Linxia basin and the anomalously low C/N ratios suggest that the organic matter in the Linxia basin has experienced significant losses through diagenetic degradation. If this is the case, the value of 10 usually used to differentiate lake algae and terrestrial organics may not apply to these very old sediments and we cannot interpret the C/N ratio as simple indicator of the source (terrestrial vs. aquatic) of organic matter in the Linxia basin. In general, the carbon isotope ratio of organic matter, δ 13 C org , of lake sediments is controlled by algae production and the proportion of C 3 and C 4 land plants in the lake's catchment ( Meyers, 1994, 2003 ). Modern terrestrial plants using the C 3 pathway have an average δ 13 C org value of about − 27.5‰ VPDB and those using the C 4 pathway are around − 13‰ ( Farquhar et al., 1989 ). The δ 13 C org of the typical lake algae in fresh water is about − 28‰ ( Meyers, 1994, 2003 ). When discussing samples collected in pre-industrial times, these three δ 13 C values should be increased by 1 to 1.5‰ to account for fossil fuel burning ( Farquhar et al., 1989 ). The δ 13 C org value has been seen to increase as high as − 9‰ when lake waters are carbon-limited and productivity is unusually high, and it can decrease to − 32‰ when large amounts of DIC derived from soil systems are added to the lake ( Meyers, 1994, 2003 ). The δ 13 C org values in the Linxia basin are within this range of δ 13 C values characterized of both lacustrine algae and C 3 land plants ( Meyers, 1997, 2003 ) ( Fig. 5 ). Alteration and degradation of organic matter in sediments may lead to a change in its carbon isotope ratio, but other studies have shown that this shift is relatively small; in almost all cases less than 2‰. Early diagenetic degradation of organic matter seems to result in a 0‰ to 4‰ decrease in the δ 13 C org values through the preferential removal of 13 C-enriched compounds ( Spiker and Hatcher, 1984; Prahl et al., 1997; Freudenthal et al., 2001 ). Small changes in the carbon isotopic composition of the soil organic matter were also observed during litter decay ( Melillo et al., 1989 ). In lacustrine settings, a recent study from Lake Lugano suggests that the eutrophic sediments are depleted by about 1.5‰ in 13 C with respect to sinking organic matter, which is in agreement with a 1.6‰ decrease in the δ 13 C org value seen within three months during an incubation-based diagenesis experiment ( Lehmann et al., 2002 ). However, studies of long-term diagenesis of organics in sediments suggest that the δ 13 C org values of highly altered organic matter may be up to 2‰ more positive than the original δ 13 C value ( Hatté et al., 1999; Krull and Skjemstad, 2003; Liu et al., 2003 ). The % C of a highly weathered soil (oxisol) in Australia decreases from 8.19 % at the surface to 0.57 % at 120–140 cm depth in the soil profile, and δ 13 C org values change from − 26‰ to − 24.5‰. It has been suggested that the 13 C-enrichment in the oxisol was caused by selective preservation of plant compounds more enriched in 13 C (physical protection of C through microaggregation with soil oxides and clays) ( Krull and Skjemstad, 2003 ). The % C and C/N ratios of loess sequences in the eastern Chinese Loess Plateau and in Nuβloch, Germany average 0.3 % and 2 to 4 respectively ( Hatté et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2003 ), showing that loess is very similar to the Linxia basin sediments in organic preservation. Carbon isotope ratios of these loess sections remain in the − 25.5 to − 22.0‰ range, reflecting their location in regions dominated by C 3 plants. The δ 13 C org values of Nuβloch loess shift from − 25.5‰ to an average of − 24.2‰ down section, and the authors suggest these values result from the degradation of a vegetation assemblage with a strong predominance of C 3 plants ( Hatté et al., 1999 ). Therefore, we conclude that, although the Linxia basin sediments have seen strong degradation of organic matter, this results in only a small shift in the δ 13 C org values. 5.4 Environmental significance of δ 13 C org in the Linxia basin A negative correlation between δ 13 C org and C/N values exists in the Linxia basin, with the highest C/N ratio associated with lowest δ 13 C org values ( Fig. 11 A ). The negative correlation could be explained by variation in the balance between internal lake productivity and terrestrial organic matter input. If variation in algal productivity is the dominant control on δ 13 C org values, then one would expect a correlation between δ 13 C org and δ 13 C of carbonate as they both are derived from the same lake water, and higher productivity should lead to more positive δ 13 C values for both organics and carbonates. There is no correlation between δ 13 C org and carbonate δ 13 C values ( Fig. 11 B) in the Linxia basin, which suggests that terrestrial plant matter contributes significantly to the organic matter in the sediment. A pollen study from the same section also indicates that significant amounts of terrestrial plant pollen have been preserved in the lake sediments ( Ma et al., 1998 ). The negative correlation of C/N ratio and δ 13 C org suggests that, despite a general lowering of C/N ratios due to loss of organic matter and/or the retention of inorganic N, the higher C/N ratios displayed by terrestrial plants are associated with the most negative δ 13 C org values. This suggests that these terrestrial plants probably used the C 3 photosynthetic pathway. The relatively stable and very negative δ 13 C org values (− 24 to − 29‰) throughout the record, with the highest C/N ratio associated with the most negative values, suggest that terrestrial C 4 grasses were either absent or insignificant in the Linxia region prior to 4.3 Ma, although C 4 grasses are significant in the region at present ( Yin and Li, 1997; Wang and Deng, 2005 ). This is in agreement with a δ 13 C record of mammalian tooth enamel from the Linxia basin, which indicates that there were no significant C 4 plants in the Linxia basin before 2–3 Ma ( Wang and Deng, 2005 ). This observation also agrees with other studies that conclude that C 4 plant expansion in the north of the Tibetan Plateau occurred later than the expansion in the south ( Quade et al., 1989; Ding and Yang, 2000; Sanyal et al., 2004 ). 5.5 Lake hydrology and climate history of the Linxia basin between 13.1 and 4.3 Ma Before ∼ 8.0 Ma, the Linxia basin was in a relatively stable tectonic setting, a foredeep depozone ( Fang et al., 2003 ). Due to the continuous flexural loading of the NE edge of the Tibetan Plateau and the thick foredeep sediments, it seems highly unlikely that the frequent oscillations between closed and open lake conditions in the Linxia basin (13.1 to 8.0 Ma) were tectonically driven. Climate variability is a much more likely cause of the frequent changes in lake hydrology and for the relationship between δ 18 O values and carbonate mineralogy ( Fig. 7 ). More negative δ 18 O values occur when the climate is cool and lake open, resulting in short water residence time in the lake and little evaporation. Conversely, high δ 18 O and δ 13 C values indicate lake closure and low lake levels, which result in strong evaporation and elevated salinity. Note that this variation occurs on both the meter scale level, between different carbonate layers, and on the millimeter scale, as shown in sample MG252 ( Fig. 8 ). Based on the stable isotope records shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , we can summarize the climatic and hydrological conditions in the Linxia basin between 13.1 and 4.3 Ma as follows. Climate varied frequently between dry and wet during the times of strong δ 18 O variation, and the lake experienced frequent shifts between closed and open conditions between 13.1 and 8.0 Ma. Dolomite formed when lake levels were low, the lake was closed and more saline, and δ 18 O values were high; these were times of more arid conditions. There is a period of enhanced dryness between 9.6 Ma and 8.5 Ma, during which (a). the frequency of marls in lake sediments increases dramatically, (b). the δ 18 O values of the carbonates reach maximum values, and (c). shallow water sediments increase due to a drop in lake level ( Fan et al., 2006 ). This arid event seems to be contemporaneous with the 3‰ shift to more positive δ 18 O values in soil carbonates in Pakistan ( Quade et al., 1989 ), which occurred beginning at ∼ 9.5 Ma (after conversion of that paper's magnetochronology to that of Cande and Kent, 1995 ). This shift is interpreted as a regional climate change preceding a change from C 3 to C 4 plant dominated landscapes in Pakistan ( Quade et al., 1989 ). The pollen record from the Maogou section in the Linxia basin shows an increase to 50% grasses and a sharp decrease in conifers beginning at about 9.2 Ma ( Ma et al., 1998; Li and Fang, 1999 — note that the chronology used in this paper matches that in Li and Fang, 1999 ). After 8.0 Ma, the regional climate became more humid and the lake basin opened, as is shown by less frequent marls and stable, low δ 18 O values. At 6.2 Ma, the basin was entrained in the uplift at the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, and the depositional setting at the basin center switched from lacustrine to fluvial. However, the δ 18 O values of the fluvial carbonates are unchanged at this time, consistent with the idea that the basin drainage system was open and the δ 18 O values of waters were controlled primarily by the isotopic composition of rainfall and runoff. In this case the filling of the lake basin and switch to fluvial conditions would not change the oxygen isotope ratio of surface waters. This also suggests that the deformation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau around 6.2 Ma was not accompanied by major changes in water sources or the isotopic composition of the atmospheric vapor at this time. Our interpretation of the isotope record disagrees with the pollen record, which is dominated by grasses in the 8.0 to 6.7 Ma interval — pollen shows a return to wetter conditions beginning at 6.7 until 5.5 Ma ( Li and Fang, 1999 ). After 5.3 Ma, either increased aridity or cooler temperatures (or both) led to a gradual increase in δ 18 O values. Although it is impossible to separate the two factors (cooler or dryer) in the stable isotope record, there is corollary evidence for both processes at this time. Aridity could increase the δ 13 C org values by affecting the water use efficiency of terrestrial C 3 plants ( Ehleringer, 1988 ), and increase the δ 18 O and δ 13 C values of carbonates by strong evaporation. Cooler climate could also increase the δ 18 O and δ 13 C values of carbonates by larger fractionation between water and carbonates. Pollen in the Maogou section becomes nearly 100% grass at 5.3 Ma and grasses dominate to the end of this record at 4.3 Ma ( Li and Fang, 1999 ). Grain-size records of eolian sediments in the Linxia basin point to a major intensification of the Asian winter monsoon at 5.3 Ma ( Fan et al., 2006 ), which would lead to a colder and dryer climate. We should point out, however, that other studies have suggested more humid Pliocene conditions farther east on the central Loess Plateau due to an increase in East Asian summer monsoon rainfall ( Ding et al., 1999 ). These studies may not be contradictory as the impact of a strengthened summer or winter monsoon on the average annual climate may differ along the gradient in aridity from east to west. Regional cooling at this time is consistent with global trends: deep-sea temperature and sea levels drop at ∼ 5.5 Ma ( Lear et al., 2000; Billups and Schrag, 2002 ). 6 Conclusions This multi-proxy study has documented a long-term climate and environmental change in the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene at the northeastern corner of the Tibetan Plateau from 13.1 to 4.3 Ma. Carbonate petrology and the stable isotope ratios of different carbonate forms show that carbonates in the Linxia basin have experienced some degree of diagenesis. However, oxygen isotope variability on both the millimeter and meter scale suggests that diagenesis is early, geologically contemporaneous with carbonate formation. Therefore, δ 18 O values still carry the geochemical signature of original surface conditions. In the case of lacustrine micrites, isotope ratios reflect lake water conditions, with frequent oscillations between more negative LMC δ 18 O values and more positive dolomite δ 18 O values arising from changing degrees of lake closure and evaporation. The organic matter preserved in the Linxia basin is a mixture of terrestrial plant matter and lake algae. The lack of correlation between δ 13 C org and carbonate δ 13 C values in the Linxia basin suggests that terrestrial plant matter makes a significant contribution. The organic matter content in the sediments of the Maogou section is very low, typically less than 0.2%. This has led to the retention of inorganic nitrogen in the sediments as organic carbon is lost to diagenesis, which in turn lowers the C/N ratio of remaining organics. The typical range of C/N ratios used to distinguish terrestrial and aquatic organics may therefore not apply in the Linxia basin. Degradation is unlikely to have changed the δ 13 C org values of the organic matter in the Linxia basin. Relatively invariant and low δ 13 C org values throughout the section are in agreement with previous studies that concluded that C 4 grasses were either absent or insignificant in the Linxia region prior to 4.3 Ma. Hydrological variation of the Linxia basin is mostly controlled by regional climate. From 13.1 to 8.0 Ma, the basin varied frequently between open and closed conditions suggesting climate cycling between arid and humid conditions. Aridity reached its maximum at 9.6–8.5 Ma. From 8.0 to 5.3 Ma, a stable humid climate dominated the region. After 5.3 Ma, the climate became gradually drier and/or cooler. Acknowledgements We would like to thank Jay Quade and Andy S.

        "abstract": "The left-lateral strike-slip Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) forming the northern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau accommodates parts of the overall convergence between the colliding Indian and Eurasian plates. Precise dating of the ATF activity is essential for understanding possible mechanisms of Tibetan Plateau deformation and uplift. Here we report a magnetostratigraphic study of the Suerkuli Basin deposits recording depositional changes during the ATF activity. Field investigations reveal a remarkable and widespread change in depositional environment in the Suerkuli Basin, i.e. a transformation from low-energy lacustrine deposits (grayish-green mud-siltstone and brown mud-siltstone) into high-energy alluviul fan deposits (poorly sorted gray pebble and cobble conglomerates). Detailed magnetostratigraphy of the 390-m-thick Daban section, at the southeastern margin of the Suerkuli Basin (38°43.09'N, 90°58.84'E), shows that this change in depositional facies occurred at ∼3.2. Ma, accompanied by a remarkable increase in sediment accumulation rate. We attribute this depositional change to the Piocene tectonic activity of the middle ATF although the contribution of the Pliocene global climate deterioration cannot be excluded. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Here we show that ice volume and ocean circulation change/global carbon mass balance are phase-locked and highly coupled regarding amplitude envelopes at the 100-ka band, but neither is phase-locked to and amplitude-coupled to the 100-ka eccentricity orbital forcing signal between 3-1 Ma. We describe this phasing and amplitude mismatch at the 100-ka band between 3-1 Ma between eccentricity forcing and paleo-ice volume records as the “late Pliocene-early Pleistocene 100-ka problem.” A free 100-ka oscillation internal to our climate system, especially those related to oscillations of atmospheric CO2 concentration, operating on an Earth characterized by a high-inertia deep thermohaline ocean that can store carbon and heat, might hold the key for the “late Pliocene-early Pleistocene 100-ka problem.”",

        "abstract": "Recent rock magnetic work on the red-clay sequence on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) convincingly demonstrates that the enhancement mechanisms of low-frequency magnetic susceptibility (i.e., measured at 470 Hz; χlf) in the red-clay sequence are similar to those in the loess-paleosol sequence. Therefore, χlf in the red-clay sequence should indicate precipitation intensity received by the CLP, as is the case in the overlying loess-paleosol sequence. Based on this result, we compared χlf in the red-clay sequence with benthic oxygen isotope records. We infer that the primary precipitation source on the CLP varies over time in three phases: during 8.1–4.5 Ma, the East Asian summer monsoon dominates; during 4.5–4 Ma, the Polar Westerlies dominate; during 4–0 Ma, the East Asian summer monsoon dominates. We attribute these precipitation source shifts on the CLP to the closure of the Panama Seaway around 4.5 Ma and the Tibetan uplift during the interval 4–2.6 Ma.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) transition, corresponds to an abrupt global cooling, thought to have been one of the greatest temperature changes in the mid-Cenozoic Earth’s history. Sparse studies have successfully reconstructed the terrestrial ecological response to this temperature change. Here, we report results from the study of organic carbon isotopes (δ 13 C TOC ), together with  n -alkanes biomarker analysis, in the Yongdeng Section, Lanzhou Basin, Northwest China, and discuss changes in δ 13 C TOC  and their mechanisms. The results show that between 35.3 Ma and 31.0 Ma, δ 13 C TOC  ranged from −26.72‰ to −21.27‰. The main change occurred at 33.4 Ma, when δ 13 C TOC  became heavier by 3‰. At this time the long-chain  n -alkane members (C 27 , C 29  and C 31 ) were dominant, suggesting the most likely sources of organic matter were terrestrial plants. Combining these results with existing measurements of plant δ 13 C TOC  and sporopollen data in adjacent areas, we infer that this change at 33.4 Ma might have been caused by an increase in gymnosperm content especially coniferous trees adapted to cold climates, which have a heavier δ 13 C TOC  than that of the angiosperms, this would have been a response to the global cooling characteristic of this period.",

        "abstract": "Vertical-axis rotations of blocks in/around the Tibetan Plateau can be attributed to the India-Asia collision. Study of the vertical-axis rotations of these blocks will increase our understanding of the mechanisms and kinematics of continent-continent collisions. We report here a new palaeomagnetic study of rotations using data from four localities (five magnetostratigraphy sections) in the Jiuquan Basin. Our study indicates that the mean declinations of each section are different from each other, similar to what has been observed in the other localities in the NE Tibetan Plateau. However, using the mean directions of every 100 m of section, we observe that the four localities have similar sequential patterns of rotations during the last 13 Ma: significant continuous counterclockwise before c. 8.0 Ma, insignificant rotations between 8.0-4.0 Ma, and slight clockwise rotation after 4.0 Ma. This indicates that, rather than being a record of spatially varying declinations, it is a temporal variation in the occurrence of regional rotations. Combined with other geological evidence, the rotation patterns may suggest two major tectonic activity phases of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the last 13 Ma: an eastward extrusion and strike-slip dominant phase before 8.0 Ma, a significant shortening and a rapid uplift dominant phase after 8.0 Ma. © The Geological Society of London 2013.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Fire provides an important indicator of paleoclimatic change. However, little information relating to late Cenozoic fire history has been gathered in mid-latitude Asia (including Inner Asia and East Asia), a key region for understanding the development of the arid-monsoon climate system as well as the driving forces behind it. Here we first report the records of microcharcoal concentrations (MC) covering the Holocene (10–0 ka) and late Pleistocene (0.8–0 Ma), which we use to analyze the fire activity patterns at an orbital time scale; then we compile the late Cenozoic MC record to investigate the long-term fire history by analyzing four cores from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) area, East Asia (representing 8–0 Ma) and three sites in Inner Asia (representing 18–2 Ma). The results show that the (i) MC remained higher during the relatively dry late Holocene/glacial stages than that during the humid middle Holocene/interglacial stages at individual sites; (ii) MC increased with time in both Inner Asia and East Asia after 18 and 8 Ma, respectively; and (iii) MC always remained higher in the dry Inner Asia than in the contemporaneous wet East Asia. All these characteristics imply that late Cenozoic fire occurrence in mid-latitude Asia experienced a gradual increasing trend along with the global temperature/ice volume change, and indicates a continuous aridification trend across mid-latitude Asia. The global cooling, rather than the Tibetan Plateau uplift, might have played a key role in this observed trend.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lacustrine sediments are important archives for paleoclimate reconstructions. The application of grain-size analysis as palaeoclimatic proxy in lacustrine clastics is valuable but also difficult because the typical polymodal grain-size distribution in these clastics. To better understand the grain-size distribution of lacustrine clastics and to promote the application of grain size in paleoenvironmental interpretation, this study investigates lacustrine clastics from northern and southern China. The grain-size distribution of these sediments was decomposed by log-normal distribution function fitting method. Based on the results, and drawing upon the concept of paleomagnetic demagnetization and “Characteristic Remnant Magnetization” from paleomagnetism, a conceptual system has been established and defined for grain-size distribution analysis. The system is composed of four components: (I) Characteristic Grain Size Component (ChGSC), (II) Affiliated Grain Size Component, (III) Meaningful Grain Size Component, and (IV) Combination Feature of Grain Size Components (CFGSCs). Based on the proposed system, ChGSC and CFGSCs were used to detect the grain-size distribution of clastics from the different lake zones investigated. Our results show the number, modal size, and percentage of ChGSC(s) in grain-size distributions are sensitive to changes in the lacustrine environment. The ChGSC(s) mirrors the dominant depositional process and hydrodynamic conditions. The modal size of ChGSC(s) is more sensitive to hydrological conditions than the widely used mean grain-size approach. Thus, the ChGSC(s) provide a useful process-related parameter for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. To test this promising application, we applied this approach to a deep drill core from the Qaidam Basin in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.",

        "abstract": "Late Pleistocene records of loess deposition are a critical archive for understanding terrestrial paleoenvironment changes in Central Asia. The age of loess is not well known for the deserts regions and surrounding high plateaus in Central Asia. Previous studies have shown that there remains a disparity between ages for loess deposition by luminescence and 14C dating. This study evaluates the potential of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to date a loess sequence resting on fluvial sands in the east Ili Basin, Central Asia. The single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol on coarse grain quartz was employed for equivalent dose determinations. The basal fluvial sand returned a secure OSL age, with low overdispersion value in equivalent doses (19��2%) of ca. 36ka and provides a close, but maximum age estimate (within 5ka) on the initiation of loess deposition. However, the loess yielded high overdispersion values for equivalent doses and age reversals, coincident with diffuse paleosols; indicating that pedoturbation with loess deposition may be a dominant process. OSL ages between ca. 45 and 14ka calculated using a maximum age model and OSL ages from other sites in the Basin suggests that the latest major period of loess deposition was between 70 and 10ka ago. A future hypothesis to test based on these analyses is that there may be three periods of heightened loess deposition at ca. 45, 35 to 19 and 14ka, when desert source areas to the west were particularly dry. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The Xining Basin on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau holds the longest continuous Cenozoic stratigraphic record in China.\n The sequence record contains considerable information on the history of Tibetan uplift and associated climatic change. In\n particular, high resolution n-alkane biomarker proxy and pollen records have been obtained from the Paleogene sediments of the Xiejia section of the basin.\n A combination of the n-alkane and palynological records reveals that the paleoclimate in the Xining Basin experienced a long-term cooling trend\n from 50.2 to 28.2 Ma with a distinctive ecological event spanning 37.5 to 32.7 Ma. Since this ecological event, a vertical\n zonation of vegetation from lowland arid grasses, to middle-elevation subtropical broad-leaf plants, to high-elevation coniferous\n trees was established. We interpret that these changes in climate and vegetation were probably responses to a combination\n of long term global cooling since the Eocene climatic optimum and uplift of the surrounding mountains on the northern Tibetan\n Plateau in the early Cenozoic.",

Analysis of the sporopollen on the second terrace of the Huangshui River drainage area indicates that during the period of formation of the second terraces, a distinct vertical vegetation zone with simple structure occurred in the area, with forest dominated by Picea growing in higher places of mountainous areas and herbaceous plants dominated by Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae growing in valleys. According to these features, combined with the sporopollen data in the neighboring areas during that period and a comparison with the characteristics of modern vegetations, the vegetations in the second terraces of the Huangshui drainage area show the features of the vegetations in the glacial period, the alluvial deposits on the terraces were also piled up in the glacial period and the river probably incised the strata in the interglacial period. The climatic change might play an innegligible role in the formation process of the river terraces.",

        "abstract": "West Kunlun Mountains have continuous loess deposits. However, very few papers have explored the rock magnetic characteristics of loess deposited there. Thus, although Kunlun Mountains loess is one of the useful paleoclimate archives, its importance has not been emphasized. Here we present detailed rock magnetic and bulk grain-size studies on a 207 m loess core on the northern slope of the West Kunlun Mountains. We find that magnetic susceptibility of loess from the northern slope of the West Kunlun Mountains is not controlled by changes in the concentration of ultrafine pedogenic magnetite and maghemite, but instead controlled by changes in the concentration of aeolian multidomain magnetite and maghemite. This is unsurprising given the low rainfall of the Kunlun region and the lack of postdepositional weathering and soil formation in these aeolian sequences. In addition, we find that magnetic susceptibility values increase dramatically at 111 m corresponding to an age of ∼0.5 Ma. The magnetic susceptibility increase is accompanied by coarsening of both bulk and magnetic grain size and softening of magnetic mineralogy. We tentatively tie these changes in rock magnetic and grain-size parameter records to an expansion of desert environment.",

The mutation of CACNA1S gene can cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoKPP) and maliglant hyperthermia synarome (MHS) in human beings. Current\n research on CACNA1S was mainly in human being and model animal, but rarely in livestock and poultry. In this study, Yorkshire pigs (23), Pietrain\n pigs (30), Jinhua pigs (115) and the second generation (126) of crossbred of Jinhua and Pietrain were used. Primers were designed\n according to the sequence of human CACNA1S gene and PCR was carried out using pig genome DNA. PCR products were sequenced and compared with that of human, and then\n single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were investigated by PCR-SSCP, while PCR-RFLP tests were performed to validate the\n mutations. Results indicated: (1) the 5211 bp DNA fragments of porcine CACNA1S gene were acquired (GenBank accession number: DQ767693 ) and the identity of the exon region was 82.6% between human and\n pig; (2) fifty-seven mutations were found within the cloned sequences, among which 24 were in exon region; (3) the results\n of PCR-RFLP were in accordance with that of PCR-SSCP. According to the EST of porcine CACNA1S gene published in GenBank (Bx914582, Bx666997), 8 of the 11 SNPs identified in the present study were consistent with the\n base difference between two EST fragments",

        "abstract": "The 28 m high-resolution Shajinping loess section in Lanzhou on the western Chinese Loess Plateau records a 60 ka, millennial summer monsoon variation. The record shows that Asian summer monsoons have rapid episodic pulse enhancements spanning only ca. 1–2 ka in high-frequency domain and having sub-Milankovitch cycles of progressive weakening in low frequency domain in the last glaciation. Soil formation seems to occur with a surprisingly fast response to these summer monsoon enhancements, resulting in weakly or moderately developed paleosol sequences. Both the pattern and timing of the summer monsoon enhancements show that they can be correlated to most major warm (Dansgaard–Oeschger) episodes and long-term cooling (Bond) cycles of the North Atlantic climatic records, indicating a possible teleconnection between tropic oceanic air masses and the North Atlantic climatic system. But differences exist for the transition of MIS 2/3 and the Holocene, where extraordinarily heavy dust-input events and fairly variable climatic fluctuations occur for the former and latter, respectively. A westerlies-swing model is proposed to interpret this link.",

        "abstract": "Carbonate content has been regarded as good proxy of aridification and monsoon change.However,the mechanism and relationship between them are still unknown.For this,a systematic sampling was carried out on modern soils,Holocene paleosol S0 and last glacial maximum loess L1 from the loess covered area to its source areas in northwest China.Samples were subsequently subjected to size fraction separation.Standard chemical analysis of calcite content from these different sized fractions demonstrates that the coarse and middle sized fractions contain very low content of calcite that changes in low magnitude and no any relationship with precipitation,while the fine fraction less than 2 μm presents a high content of calcite with a large magnitude change.Further,its content decreases with increase of precipitation from samples from modern soils and Holocene paleosol S0,and has no clear relationship with precipitation for samples from loess L1.This pattern of calcite change resembles variations of total calcite and carbonate content,indicating that the fine calcite is the major contributor for the variations of total calcite and carbonate content.This proves the fine calcite is indeed mostly originated from secondary calcite forming in pedogenesis,thus,its content reflects the degree of pedogenesis and summer monsoon change.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Khorat Plateau holds one of the worldu0027s largest potash deposits. Although many attempts have been made, the age of the potash-bearing strata remains poorly determined. Here, we report a high resolution magnetostratigraphic study of a 595.4 m-deep potash bearing borehole (ZK2893) in the southeast Sakhon Nakhon Basin in central Laos. This borehole penetrated the whole potash-bearing Nong Boua Formation and reached the underlying sandstone beds of the Nam Noy Formation. A total of 500 (383 level) cubic paleomagnetic samples were collected.  k -T curves and hysteresis loops revealed that hematite and magnetite were the main magnetic carriers and were likely of detrital origin, as indicated by microscopic and Electron Microprobe Analysis (EMPA) examinations. Progressive thermal and alternating field (AF) demagnetization isolated 229 valid characteristic remnant magnetizations (ChRMs), which showed a normal and antipodal distribution of the inclination data. Both the microscopic and EMPA examinations and inclination-only analysis suggest primary magnetizations of the ChRMs, yielding nine normal and seven reversed polarity zones. Combined with regional palynological, isotopic and sedimentologic evidence, the obtained polarity zones were best correlated to the geomagnetic polarity time scale of Gradstein et al. (2012) (GPTS2012), yielding magnetostratigraphic ages of u003e 63.5 Ma to ~ 92 Ma for the potash-bearing Nong Boua Formation and ~ 85 Ma for the potash bed in its lower salt unit.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Eocene-Oligocene climate transition (EOCT) at ~34 Ma is a pronounced environmental reorganization that occurred in the Cenozoic era and has been extensively studied via marine archives. However, to date, there is still a less well-dated continental record across the EOCT, which can mostly be attributed to a lack of suitable proxies used in the varied continental settings in terms of sedimentary facies, provenance and climate, thus resulting in a poor understanding of the continental response to this transition. Located on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, the Qaidam Basin is filled with continuous and well-exposed Cenozoic fluvio-lacustrine sediments. Cenozoic lacustrine sediment has been proven to be an ideal archive to study the continental climatic response to the EOCT. Here, we present the detailed mineralogical and elemental composition of chlorite, a widespread clay mineral in continental sediments formed by rock weathering, collected from a lacustrine sequence in the northern Qaidam Basin to constrain the onset of the EOCT and the related climatic response. The results show that chlorite abundance, crystallinity indices, intensity ratios of chlorite diagnostic peaks and chemical composition collectively exhibit remarkable changes at ~34.3 Ma. To be more specific, the well-crystallized Fe-Mg-rich chlorites were characterized by a high Fe content before the EOCT and turned into high-Mg-content Mg-chlorites with poor crystallinity. The chlorite chemical composition change is assumed to have been related to regional drying after the EOCT, thus providing new insights into the continental paleoenvironmental change based on this novel proxy.",

The flame retardancy of the flame retardant PP were evaluated by limiting oxygen index (LOI) and UL 94 test, and the synergistic effect and flame retardant mechanism were studied by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that there is good synergistic effect between ET and APP. Moreover, the flame retardancy of ET/APP varies with their mass ratio. And the optimal flame retardancy can be obtained when the mass ratio of ET to APP is 1:2. When the mass content of ET/APP is 30%, LOI of the flame retardant PP reaches 29.7%, and UL 94 V-0 rating can be achieved.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge of the evolution of the Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) has significant implications for our understanding of the tectonic deformation of the Tibetan Plateau. Controversy exists regarding the formation of the orocline-like arcuate structures or curved thrust faults south of the ATF. In this paper, we conducted a paleomagnetic rotation study of the Akatengnengshan (AK) and Youshashan (YSS) anticlines to determine whether the changes in the anticlines’ axes were caused by frictional drag associated with sinistral strike-slip faulting along the ATF. No significant paleomagnetic rotations during the last 20 Ma were observed at the Xichagou and Laomangai localities, which are situated along the YSS anticline, whereas significant counterclockwise (CCW) rotations of ~50° that occurred between ~16.2 and 11.1 Ma was noted at the Yitunbulake locality, which lies along the western edge of the AK anticline. This amount of CCW rotation is consistent with the difference in axes between the AK and YSS anticlines. Combined with other geological evidence, we believe that the middle ATF was active between ~16 and 11 Ma. Frictional drag associated with sinistral strike-slip motion likely resulted in the ~50° CCW rotation of the AK anticline, which was originally straight or parallel to the YSS anticline. There was concentrated or insignificant strike-slip faulting along the middle ATF before ~16 Ma, but rapid and distributed (u003c40 km) strike-slip faulting occurred between ~16 and 11 Ma at a rate of ≥10 mm/yr, and the minimum displacement was ~50 km.",

        "abstract": "Qaidam Basin is the largest terrestrial basin of the Tibetan Plateau and has the most continuous sedimentary record in the Cenozoic. Although constituting the first known fossil vertebrates of the Tibetan Plateau and discovered in early scientific expeditions in the 1930s, mammalian fossils from Qaidam Basin have not played a significant role in studying the basin stratigraphy. Our explorations in the Qaidam Basin during the past 8 years have resulted in the first well documented collection of fossil vertebrates from there. In addition to being the best organisms for terrestrial biostratigraphy in the Cenozoic, the new fossil vertebrates offer a unique window into the ancient biotas that chronicle the late Cenozoic uplift of the plateau and associated environmental changes. Here we establish for the first time a faunal sequence of early Oligocene to early Pliocene age. Four mammalian faunas are recognized: Olongbuluk Mammal Fauna (middle Miocene), Tuosu Mammal Fauna (early late Miocene), Shengou Mammal Fauna (early late Miocene), and Huaitoutala Mammal Fauna (early Pliocene). All four mammal faunas can be directly or indirectly tied to a paleomagnetic section in the Olongbuluk–Huaitoutala area, permitting robust calibration of the chronology of these faunas. At least four fish faunas are also found: Lulehe Fish Fauna (late early to early late Oligocene), Shengou Fish Fauna (early late Miocene), Eboliang Fish Fauna (late late Miocene to early Pliocene), and Yahu Fish Fauna (early Pliocene). The fish faunas represent the only records of their respective times in the Tibetan Plateau and thus by themselves cannot be used for age determination. However, these fish faunas are either integrated into paleomagnetic sections or directly tied to mammal faunas of known ages, permitting independent assessment of their chronology. Zoogeographically, Qaidam mammal faunas show increasing endemism through time, presumably related to topographic barriers formed by the growth and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and to climatic changes triggered by the same tectonic process. Fishes that were trapped in internally drained basins developed pachyostotic morphologies caused by hypersaline environments, which are associated with the increasing aridity of the Tibetan Plateau since early Pliocene.",

It can provide significant clues for regional environmental and palaeogeographic reconstructions. There are problems associated with lithostratigraphic correlation; diachronous deposition of similar lithological units may not be recognized. We report here an attempt to determine lateral facies changes in coeval sedimentary sections, through three-dimensional magnetostratigraphic correlations in the Guide Basin, an intramontane basin in the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. The method is successful for correlating lateral facies and helps to identify sediment sources in the basin. © The Geological Society of London 2013.",

The paleomagnetism\n and climatic records of an over 80 m loess-paleosol sequence on the highest river terrace at the foot of Kunlun Mountains\n show that the loess formed at ≈ 880 ka B.P., suggesting a roughly synchronous occurrence of the present-like air circulation\n and extremely dry climate and the initial desert. The uplift of the Tibetan-Pamir Plateau and Tian-shan Mountains may initiate\n these events. The rise of the plateau and adjacent mountains caused the drying and desertification of China inland and Tarim\n Basin, which was dramatically enhanced at ≈ 500 ka B.P., leading the desert to expand to its present scale. Global change\n just overprints this drying trend. Local climate response to global change both in long-term evolution and glacial-interglacial\n cycles manifests that the stronger the westerlies, the more the precipitation. But the heat-moisture pattern seems still similar\n to that in the Asian monsoon region.",

These strata recorded the evolution of the structure and environment of the basin and its surrounding mountains. Based on Late Cenozoic sedimentary rock magnetic study of the Honggouzi section in the northwest Qaidam Basin, we found that the value of magnetic susceptibility increased dramatically in the~9.8 Ma, together with significant increase the amount of magnetite. Combined with sedimentary facies, lithology and sedimentation rate, and based on the relationship between the magnetic properties of sediments and environmental change, and the tectonic activities, we believe that the dramatic changes of rock magnetic characteristics may have been caused by the changes of sedimentary provenances in~9.8 Ma. It may imply a significant uplift event of the northeastern margin of Tibet Plateau. Altyn Tagh was one of sources of the Qaidam Basin, which responded to this tectonic movement. The mountin reached certain height so that the erosion rate increased, this process was recorded by Honggouzi.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of gypsum hydration water can be useful for determining the isotopic composition of the original brine from which gypsum precipitated. However, relatively few long-term and continuous records of the stable isotope geochemistry of gypsum hydration water in arid regions have been reported. We measured the δ 18 O and δD of primary gypsum hydration water from a 938.5 m-long deep core (SG-1) in the western Qaidam Basin to study the mechanisms that contributed to gypsum formation and to reconstruct potential paleoclimatic change. The measured δ 18 O and δD ranged from − 4.21‰ to 8.69‰ and from − 72.77‰ to 49.73‰, respectively. The linear relationship between δ 18 O and δD indicates that meteoric water was the original source of the gypsum hydration water. The gradient of 5.39 for the δ 18 O and δD plots is lower than that of global meteoric water, suggesting that paleo-lakewater evaporated and became a CaSO 4 -rich brine leading to gypsum deposition. The evaporation/precipitation (E/P) ratio played an important role in determining δ 18 O and δD. The oscillations noted in the δ 18 O and δD of the gypsum hydration water imply that: (a) there was a long-term and stepwise aridification after ~ 2.2 Ma in the western Qaidam Basin; and (b) there were three increasingly dry phases at 2.2–1.2 Ma, 1.2–0.6 Ma, and 0.6–0.1 Ma, with two cold and dry events at ~ 1 Ma and ~ 0.6 Ma. Global cooling, especially during the Mid Pleistocene Climate Transition event (MPT), may have been the primary cause of the aridification recorded in core SG-1 in the Asian inland.",

The magnetostratigraphy of the Dongshanding section, located nearby, reveals a partially overlapping reversal record with ages from 2.2 to 0 Ma, and facilitates correlation of the Wangjiashan section with the global polarity time scale. A new stratigraphic division of the Wangjiashan section replaces the name Linxia formation by five new formation names, based on lithologic variation and mammalian fossil finds. The new formations and their magnetostratigraphically determined ages are: Dongshan Formation (c. 1.75–2.6 Ma), Jishi Fm. (c. 2.6–3.6 Ma), Hewangjia Fm. (4.5–6.0 Ma), Liushu Fm. (6.0–7.6 Ma), and Dongxiang Fm. (7.6–c. 12 Ma). The Neogene stratigraphy and fossil mammals suggest that the nearby part of the Tibetan Plateau experienced a persistent denudation during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene, but that it was uplifted more rapidly at about 3.6 Ma.",

Some of these are of great significance in mammal evolution and stratigraphic correlation on\n and around the Tibetan Plateau and North China. However, the chronology of these mammals is poorly constrained. Dating of\n the mammals will not only place precise age constraints on the mammals, but also provide much information on the related stratigraphy\n that records the uplift process of the Tibetan Plateau. Detailed paleomagnetism of the upper part of the Cenozoic stratigraphy\n at He’erjia and Lajigai north of Guide County has revealed magnetic chrons that can be correlated to Gauss and 3An chrons,\n determining the section spanning about 3.1–6.5 Ma and the first, second and third layers of fossil mammals at about 5.25,\n 5.1 and 4.4 Ma, respectively. Ages of the significant genus Gazella kueitensis and the Chinese elephant Anancus sinensis are firstly constrained at about 5.25 MaBP and 4.4 Ma, respectively. The mammalian evolution and the associated increase\n in coarse sediments and sedimentation rate may suggest that the northeastern Tibetan Plateau was uplifted rapidly at that\n time, and the eastern Tibetan Plateau with its neighboring regions was not high enough to stop mammal exchange between the\n northern and southern sides of the Tibetan Plateau.",

        "title": "New radiometric dating constrains the time for initiation of the Karakorum fault zone (KFZ), SW Tibet",
        "abstract": "The Karakorum fault zone (KFZ), composed of strike-slip faults, has played an important role in intra-continental deformation during the Cenozoic convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plates. However, the spatial and temporal evolution of the KFZ remains under debate. This paper reports new zircon U–Pb Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP) and biotite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages for samples from the fault zone to clarify the timing of events. The ages of Zircon U–Pb fall mainly around 47–50 Ma, which corresponds to a period of important magmatic activity of the Gangdese granitic belt (also known as the Trans-Himalayan magmatic belt). A metamorphic event followed in the period around 32 Ma, and that was then followed by a medium temperature cooling event between about 12 and 7.7 Ma. Biotite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages provide evidence that the 12–7.7 Ma cooling event coincides with the initiation of the KFZ cutting through the Ayilari granite. The Ayilari granite pluton does not seem to have experienced the separate 25–23 Ma cooling event, as shown in previous studies 60–80 km west of the current study area [Lacassin, R., Valli, F., Arnaud, N., Leloup, P.H., Paquette, J.L., Li, H., Tapponnier, P., Chevalier, M.L., Guillot, S., Maheo, G., Xu, Z., 2004. Large-scale geometry, offset and kinematic evolution of the Karakorum fault, Tibet. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 219 (3–4), 255–269.; Valli, F., Arnaud, N., Leloup, H.P., Sobel, E.R., Maheo, G., Lacassin, R., Guillot, S., Li, H., Tapponnier, P., Xu, Z., 2007.

New U–Th/Pb constraints on timing of shearing and long-term slip-rate on the Karakorum fault. Tectonics 27, doi:10.1029/2007TC002184.]. We conclude that the 25–23 Ma cooling event bears no relationship to the activity of the KFZ, but resulted from a local metamorphic event caused either by a regional tectonic event (such as activity of the south Kailas thrust fault) or by magmatism around Shiquanhe (also known as Gar). The study of the KFZ around Namru supports the opinion that the KFZ propagated along the fault strike to the Gar-Menshi area around 12 Ma.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid nanostructures comprising conjugated polymers (CPs) and plasmonic metals show excellent performance in light harvesting. However, the energy transfer mechanism of the CP film to nearby metal nanoparticles, especially knowledge of the characteristic distance, is still unclear. Here, quenching of the emission of a CP film in proximity to a monolayer of graphene-nanodot-supported silver nanoparticles (GND-Ag NPs) is investigated. Uniform Ag NPs with D = 3.2 nm were grown on GNDs in situ under mild light irradiation, and a series of bilayer structures of GND-Ag NPs/CPs were constructed by spin-coating blue, green and red light-emitting poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO), poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) and poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV),respectively, on top of the GND-Ag NP plane. The spacer distance was controlled by the layers of assembled polyelectrolytes. Both steady and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed emission quenching of the bilayer structures, providing the maximum efficiency of 99% for the F8BT films. The surface density of GND-Ag NPs and the spacer distance-dependent PL quenching data were analyzed within the plasmonic resonant energy transfer model, and the extracted characteristic distances are 6 nm, 3 nm and 10 nm for the PFO, F8BT and MEH-PPV systems, respectively. Current-sensing atomic force microscopy shows that the GND-Ag NPs/F8BT film exhibits enhanced electrical conductivity. These results are believed to be important for the development of plasmonic enhanced polymer photovoltaics and photocatalysis.",

        "abstract": "As the largest temperate arid region,Central Asia has been attracting widely interests for its aridification,since it has long thought to relate strongly to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau,the retreat of the North Tethys and the growth of Arctic ice.Therefore,a good understanding of the process and trend of Asian aridity is of great significance to both practical and theoretical study.However,most of the existed evidence on this issue are indirect,largely from the eolian records in the Chinese Loess Plateau,and little from inland arid area.Shortage of stable and continuous sediment records and convincing evidence is obvious.The Qaidam Basin,sitting on north Eastern Tibetan Plateau,develops continuous and well-exposed Cenozoic sediments,which provided an unique opportunity to study Asian aridity.We present a continuous lake sediment section from the Yahu anticline,a former playa lake in Central Qaidam Basin.It consists of Shizigou and Qigequan Formations.The age of the Yahu section was determined at ca.5.30～1.83Ma with a stratigraphic lacuna of 4.2～3.7Ma,by paleo～magnetism and fossils of ostracode and fish.Sporopollen and salinity proxy records indicate that there developed a steppe dominated by Artemisia,Chenopoidaceae,Ephedra,Gramineae around the Yahu area and the climate had already become dry at ca.5.3Ma.Higher contents of CaCO3,Cl-and SO2-4 lend support to this.From 3.4Ma to 2.6Ma,the percentage of arid herbs was increased slightly from 24.45% to 26.2%,but the contents of ions above decreased to some extent.We speculate that the seasonality was enhanced,accompanied with enlarged relief during this time.This would make higher mountains intercept more precipitation from the enhanced summer monsoon,and hence bringing more water into the lake,while the wide basin surface turned to more arid due to the foehn effect and enhanced winter monsoon.Since 2.6Ma,the average percentages of xerophilous plants increased from 26.2% to 37.58%,CaCO3 from 10.5% to 18.28%,Cl-from 70.4g/kg to 80.4g/kg,and SO2-4 from 3.8g/kg to 8.4g/kg,respectively,with an evident long-term drying trend,especially after 2.2Ma in salinity proxies.Global cooling and the onset of Northern hemisphere ice sheets at this time may considerably weaken the ocean evaporation and transportation of water vapor into Asian inland and intensify the winter monsoon,thus enhance the rapid aridification of the Qaidam Basin since that time.",

        "abstract": "Sediments shed from the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, the Qilian Mountains, are widely deposited in the foreland\n basin, the Jiuxi Basin, archiving plenty of information about the mountain surface uplift and erosion history. The Laojunmiao\n section, 1960 m thick, representing the upper sequence of the Cenozoic basin sediments, is paleomagnetically dated to about\n 13-0 Ma BP. Detailed sedimentary study of this sequence has revealed five sedimentary facies associations which determine\n four stages of sedimentary environment evolution. They are: (I) the half-deep lake system before 12.18 Ma BP, (II) the shallow\n lake system between 12.18 and 8.26 Ma BP, (III) the fan delta dominated sedimentary system in dry climate between 8.26 and\n 6.57 Ma BP, and (IV) alluvial fan system since 6.57 Ma BP. The associated mountain erosion and uplift are suggested to have\n experienced three phases, that is, tectonic stable (13-8.26 Ma BP), gradual uplift (8.26-<4.96 Ma BP), and rapid intermittent\n uplift (>3.66-0 Ma BP). The uplift at ∼3.66 Ma BP is of great importance in tectonics and geomorphology. Since then, tectonic\n uplift and mountain building have been accelerated and become strong intermittent. At least three significant tectonic events\n took place with ages at <1.80-1.23, 0.93-0.84 and 0.14 Ma BP, respectively. Thus, the uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau\n is a complex process of multiple phases, unequal speed and irregular movements.",

        "abstract": "In this study, n-alkanes, isoprenoids and n-alkyl-ketones were detected in lacustrine sediments in the Maogou section of the Linxia Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau, NW China. The distribution characteristics of these compounds correspond to arid climate change in inland Asia from the upper Oligocene to the Pliocene. The characteristic bimodal distribution of n-alkanes, which was observed in the investigated samples, is centered on n-C 17-n-C 20 and has maximum values at n-C 18 in all samples; n-C 27-n-C 31 has maximum values at n-C 29 in some of the samples. The front mode shows a weak even carbon number predominance of short-chain n-alkanes (CPI 17-21 0.55-0.89); in contrast, the back mode has a strong odd carbon number predominance of long-chain n-alkanes (CPI 25-31 1.41-2.42). Changes in the nC 27/nC 31 ratio (woody plants/grassy plants) along the entire section corresponded to three climate stages: an arid to humid climate stage from ~22.5 to 18.4Ma; 6.25 to 5.5Ma; and two major humid stages at ~18.4Ma and ~5.5Ma. A warm-humid climate was identified for the ~10Ma to ~9Ma period, which turned to an arid-cold climate from ~8Ma to ~7.5Ma, by assessing changes in the (n-C 17-n-C 21)/(n-C 27-n-C 31) ratios. Warm-humid conditions gradually increased from ~7.5Ma to ~5.5Ma, as has been confirmed by multiple geochemical climate indicators. A distinctive climate change toward arid-cold conditions at ~8Ma corresponded to a striking increase in the high-carbon-numbered n-alkanes and a rapid decrease in the (n-C 17-n-C 21)/(n-C 27-n-C 31) and n-C 27/n-C 31 ratios of n-alkanes, which suggests a large input of higher plants. Our observation from the biomarker analysis is in agreement with previous reports that used palynofloras to determine that climate change in the investigated region responded to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau at ~8Ma. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The widely distributed red clay sediment underlying the Chinese Loess Plateau truly records the Neogene environmental evolution,\n and its genesis and development are intrinsically related to the uplift processes of the Tibetan Plateau and the evolution\n of East Asia monsoon system. In this paper, a detailed magnetostratigraphy of a loess-red clay section (107°13′E, 35°02′N)\n from the central Loess Plateau is reported. The loess-red clay sequence is composed of 175 m Quaternary loess-paleosol sequence\n and 128 m Neogene red clay sediments. Based on the correlation with the standard geomagnetic polarity time scale, the paleomagnetic\n results indicate that the age of Chaona red clay sequence extends to 8.1 Ma, which is the older red clay deposition in the\n central Chinese Loess Plateau. The commencement of red clay at ∼8.1 Ma may imply that the Ordos planation surface was broken\n by the movement of the Haiyuan-Liupanshan Faults, which was related to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau induced by the collision\n of India Plate and Eurasian Plate. And the western part adjacent to the Tibetan Plateau was uplifted to form the embryo of\n the Liupan Shan (Mts.) and the eastern part was down-faulted to receive red clay deposition. We link this faulting to an initial\n uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. The undulating nature of the broken Ordos planation surface may explain the chronological differences\n and depth discrepancies among various cross-sections of red clay.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Potash deposits are common in the Mesozoic-Cenozoic Tethyan domain, which features the giant potash deposits in the Late Jurassic Central Asian Basin and the Late Cretaceous Khorat Basin of Thailand-Laos. Widespread evaporitic sequences from these intervals have been found in some marine and transitional basins within the Chinese continental blocks, such as the Yangtze, Simao and Tarim blocks, in which, only one small-scale potash deposit had been found in the Late Cretaceous Simao Basin. These evaporites are commonly characterized by depositional cycles that are more frequent than those of other potash basins around the world. It remains debated whether large or giant potash deposits could be formed in Chinese blocks of Tethyan domain, and if so, what mechanism was responsible for the potash formation. To address these issues, we comprehensively review the Meso-Cenozoic drift history and collision dynamics of these Chinese blocks and summarize the formation mechanism, depositional characteristics, and paleoclimate of the evaporite basins in these blocks. These blocks drifted from the Southern Hemisphere and collided and welded together in the beginning of the late Permian in the Northern Hemisphere. The collisions often commenced in the east and gradually spread to the west of these blocks, resulting in: (1) westward seawater retreat; (2) differential topographic uplift with high topography in the east and low topography in the west and (3) increasingly closed depositional environments in these basins. In addition, these collisions often exerted nearly N-S-oriented principal compressive stress, which resulted in nearly E-W-oriented extension. These forces induced a series of faulted-bounded subsidence belts with N-S-striking extensional sub-basins arranged in an E-W-oriented chain in these blocks. In this chain-like sub-basins system, as sea level rose and seawater flowed from west to east, the western sub-basins proximal to the open sea would have precipitated calcium carbonates and calcium sulfates, resulting in a high degree of concentration by the time the brines reached the distal end, i.e. eastern sub-basins. Ultimately, potash minerals were commonly deposited in the easternmost sub-basins. Based on the above model of potash formation, we predict that potash deposits may be formed in certain sub-basins in the eastern part of these basins in Chinese Tethyan blocks, which maybe lay a theoretical foundation for China’s future exploration of potash deposits.",

        "abstract": "A rare lacustrine rhythmite from the Qiulinanmu Playa Lake in Tibet is presented, which was composed of distinct layers of\n mirabilite, borax, and clay with thickness measuring 1.5–75 cm, 0.5–20 mm, and 0.5–30 mm, respectively. The thickness of each\n layer was measured in the field and dating was performed using 14C and U data. The lake was previously supplied by river water, groundwater, and hot springs enriched in sodium, sulfur, and\n boron. Control factors on the rhythmite were climate oscillations and compositional differences of water. The adsorption of\n boron by clay minerals could be attributed to the alternation between clay and borax layers. Low temperature, high pH, and\n high evaporation exerted significant influences on the precipitation of original borax and mirabilite. In the evaporative\n lake, the precipitation of mirabilite (a mineral indicative of a cold-dry environment) was dominant and produced the asymmetric\n couplets. The lake water was poor in chloride and rich in sodium sulfate, and an abrupt change was observed at 11.4 cal. kyr\n bp. According to the laminated sediment and the thickness of the minerals, the climate was dry-cold with four sub-warm phases\n before 11.4 kyr bp (after 20.6–11.4 kyr bp), and wet-warm with four sub-cold pulses after 11.4 kyr bp (11.4–5.2 kyr bp). The two thickest mirabilite layers suggested extremely hard conditions after 20.6 kyr bp, and before 11.4 kyr bp, respectively.",

        "title": "HIGH RESOLUTION ROCK MAGNETIC RECORDS OF CENOZOIC SEDIMENTS IN THE LINXIA BASIN AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS ON DRYING OF ASIAN INLAND",
        "abstract": "Some important environmental events occurred in the Cenozoic that are closely related to our present earth system are global cooling, Asian monsoon, and drying of Asian inland. Among them, the aridification of Asian inland and other parts of the world is one of the most important scientific questions for its severe influence on wide areas with large population. The present state of the aridity in NW China is not only a result of long-term natural environmental evolution but also affected by severe human activities. In order to predict and reduce the aridity progress in NW China, we must answer firstly questions including: when did this aridity begin? how was it evolved? how does it run? what is its driving mechanism? and what are its relationships with the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and global cooling? For answering these questions, the most urgent thing at present is to obtain a series of Cenozoic continuous arid climatic environment records in semiarid and arid areas. Fortunately, there are many basins in NW China filled with thick Cenozoic sediments which archive great information on drying of NW China. One of these basins is the Linxia Basin located at the joint part of the southwestern Chinese Loess Plateau and the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau in Linxia City, Gansu Province, an ideal place to carry the study above due to its almost continuous persistence of mostly fine lacustrine sediments in arid environment.The Linxia Basin yields one of the most abundant fossil mammal sites in China. Detailed paleontological, stratigraphical and paleomagnetic studies have divided the stratigraphy in seven formations upperwards as the Tala Fm.(ca. 29.0～21.4Ma), Zhongzhuang Fm.(21.40～14.68Ma), Shangzhuang Fm.(14.68～13.07Ma), Dongxiang Fm.(13.07～7.80Ma), Liushu Fm.(7.80～6.25Ma), and Hewangjia Fm.(6.25～4.34Ma). These formations reflect five sedimentary cycles manifested as alluvial-flood plain-shallow lake(29.0～21.4Ma), braided river-shallow lake(21.40～13.07Ma), delta-lake(13.07～6.25Ma), and river-flood plain(6.25～4.34Ma).Acquisition and back-field measurement of isotherm remanent magnetization(IRM), thermal demagnetization of natural remanent magnetization(NRM), and three-axis components of IRM show that hematite, maghemite, and magnetite are primary magnetic minerals in the Linxia sediments; but the relative proportions(percentage occurrence in accounting samples)of these magnetic minerals changed significantly since ca. 8Ma, before which hematite, magnetite, and maghemite are respectively of 67.8%,32.2%, and 45.8%, while after at 50.0%, 62.3%, and 69.3%, similar to those of eolian red clay and loess. High-resolution magnetic susceptibility, ARM, and grain size time series records show that they run at relative stable fluctuations along their means between 29.0Ma and 8.6Ma. Exceptions are only for some short intervals at 21.5～19.0Ma, 13.9～4.7Ma, 13.0Ma, 11.5Ma, and 9.8～8.2Ma(in Fig.1), when sedimentary facies changed obviously from persistent fine lake sediments to coarse sediments. The values of all records began to increase slowly but persistently since 8.6Ma, but the speed fast up since 7.4～6.4Ma and again since 5.3Ma, with their characteristics(magnetic mineral and properties and grain size)comparable with those of typical eolian red clay and loess. We interpret that the Linxia paleoenvironment was relatively stable and had no significant response to some important ocean-revealed global climatic events between 29.0Ma and 8.6Ma. This may imply that the Linxia area was long controlled by planetary winds during that time. After 8.6Ma, the eolian dusts were gradually transported into the Linxia Basin. The transportation was enhanced since 7.4～6.4Ma and 5.3Ma respectively, suggesting that the drying of Asian inland began at 8.6Ma and was strengthened rapidly since 7.4～6.4Ma and 5.3Ma. Comparing our records with the Tibetan uplift and global climatic records, we propose that the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau at ca. 9～8Ma and the subsequent rapid uplifts may be responsible for the initial drying of Asian inland and sine about 7.4～6.4Ma, global cooling, especially the onset of Arctic ice sheet may have added force to drive the fast aridification of Asian inland.",

        "abstract": "on the basis of the analysis of structure and sedimentary evolution of the seismic section in Western Qaidam Basin and combining the basement lithology,faults distribution and history of tectonic movement,we reconstructed the dynamical evolution framework of structure and sedimentation of Western Qaidam Basin during the Cenozoic.Our results suggested that Western Qaidam Basin was under the compression tectonic background of the Tibetan Plateau uplift caused by the collision of India and Eurasia in the Cenozoic and underwent two violent periods of tectonic deformation.The Western Qaidam Basin had undergone two periods of tectonic deformation.The first ocurred in the Paleocene,and reached the peak at the E23;the second was in the Neocene-Quaternary,and the deformation intensified rapidly.The forces transmitted from the south to the north,while the tectonic deformation spread from the west to the east,which indicated that the thrust of the Kunlun fault and the slip of the Altyn Tagh fault were controlled by the collision of the India-Asia Plate and the northward uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.Changes of the sedimentary facies indicatd that Western Qaidam Basin has undergone a process: Inflow-sedimentation-recession and the evolution of sedimentary facies were the result of tectonics.Separated by Youbei fault,in northern region of Western Qaidam Basin there existed thrust folders with the interphase upwarping and depression,generally with closed anticlines and relatively broad synclines,whose axial direction was consistent with the trend of Kunlun Mountains.Between Youbei fault and Ⅺ fault was the palingenetic Yingxiongling orogenic which made obvious elevation difference(about 800m) between the Yingxiongling region and the northern and southern Western Qaidam Basin.The characteristics of structure-sedimentation evolution in Western Qaidam Basin was in response to Tibetan Plateau uplift,and was a good record of intermittent spread of the Tibetan Plateau northward as well.",

        "abstract": "The ~800-km-long dextral Karakoram fault zone (KFZ) bounds SW Tibet and, despite a number of recent studies, its spatial and temporal evolution and consequent role in continental deformation remains under debate. In order to better constrain fault evolution we present U-Pb Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP) and 40Ar/39Ar analyses of granitic samples from the southern portion of the Karakoram Fault. Zircons from the ductile shear zone in the Namru region of the Ayilari granite batholith record a crystallization age compatible with Gangdese magmatism belt (also known as the Trans-Himalayan magmatic Belt, THB) followed by a medium temperature cooling event between about 12.8-11.5Ma. And zircons from the ductile shear zone in the Zhaxigang region of the Ayilari granite batholith record a crystallization age of 18.7Ma. The Ayilari granite batholith near Namru appears to have experienced neither the 32Ma nor 25-22Ma magmatic events reported by previous studies. Biotite 40Ar/39Ar ages provide evidence that the 12.8-11.5Ma cooling event coincides with the initiation of the KFZ cutting through the Ayilari granite, both at Namru and Zhaxigang. Consequently, we conclude that the previously reported 32Ma, 25-22Ma and 22-14Ma events bear no relationship to the activity along the Karakoram fault, but resulted from either local metamorphic events caused by regional tectonics (such as activity on the south Kailas thrust fault), or from magmatism around Shiquanhe (also known as Gar). This study supports the conclusion that the KFZ, at least in the Zhaxigang-Namru region, propagated along strike to the Gar-Menshi area as a thin-skinned structure at around 13Ma. © 2011.",

It may indicate that the\n climate system at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere had played an important role in both the Plateau monsoon and the\n highlevel westerlies. On 104 year scale, there are two distinct anomalous changes, which are not found in the records from high latitude northern hemisphere,\n revealed by the loess grain size in the Hezuo Basin. One is that there was a considerable grain size increase at ∼36 kaBP,\n suggesting an abrupt enhancement of the Plateau winter monsoon at that time; the other is that, during 43–36 kaBP, the grain\n size decreased distinctly, indicating a notable weakening of the Plateau winter monsoon around that period. Both of the two\n anomalies suggest that the Tibetan climate may have been controlled by some other factors, besides the high latitude climatic\n changes in the Northern Hemisphere.",

Previous studies have verified that the Quaternary uplift in this region had a multi-stage character; however geologists have not established which event constituted the main tectonic phase. Fortunately, stratigraphic and paleomagnetic evidence from the Jiuquan Basin, Gansu Province, China, now confirm that the Laojunmiao Movement (represented as an angular unconformity) occurred between ̃0.9 and 0.8Ma; and an almost synchronous tectonic event has been well recorded within and around the Plateau. Moreover, many proxies indicate that the global climate changed more rapidly after ̃0.9Ma. These proxies include eolian loess and vermiculated red soils caused by the Asian monsoon, the eolian sedimentation rate, the Stilostomella extinction, changes in the global thermohaline circulation, and the increased δ13C values recorded in the marine sediments. Based on the uplift-driven climate change, the mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) could be the result of the Laojunmiao Movement. Certainly, the Laojunmiao Movement and MPT had the significant impact on the Quaternary earth. We conclude that the Laojunmiao Movement was likely the main tectonic phase of the Quaternary Plateau uplift. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Most existing tectonic models suggest Pliocene-Quaternary deformation and uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau in response to the collision of India with Asia. Within the NE Tibetan Plateau, growth of the terranes was suggested to progress northeastward with the Yumu Shan (mountain) at the northeasternmost corner of the Qilian Shan (mountains) being uplifted only since about 1 Ma ago. Here we present a detailed palaeomagnetic dating and tectonosedimentological measurement of Cenozoic sediments in the eastern Jiuquan Basin related to the deformation and uplift of the North Qilian Shan and Yumu Shan. The results show that the eastern Jiuquan Basin is a Cenozoic foreland basin and received sediments at about 27.8 Ma at the latest. Eight subsequent tectonic events at about 27.8, 24.6, 13.7-13, 9.8-9.6, 5.1-3.6, 2.8-2.6, 0.8 and 0.1 Ma demonstrate the development of the foreland basin in response to Oligocene-Quaternary uplift of the North Qilian Shan and subsequent propagation of thrust-fold system owing to collision of India with Asia. The Yumu Shan is the late phase of deformation front in the thrust-fold system and commenced rapid uplift at about 9.8-9.6 Ma at the latest. A rigid block-floating model is proposed to interpret the mechanism of this deformation and uplift history. © The Geological Society of London 2013.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The megamonsoon was a striking event that profoundly impacted the climatic environment and related mineral sources (salts, coals and oil-gases) in the Mesozoic. How this event impacted Asia is unknown. Here, we firstly reported a Mesozoic stratigraphic sequence in the northern Qiangtang Basin, in the central Tibetan Plateau, based on lithofacies and chronologies of paleontology and magnetostratigraphy. How the planetary and megamonsoon circulations controlled the Asian climate with time has been recorded. Using the basic principles of physical geography, present analogs and a newly developed model, the evolution of the stratigraphic sequence was interpreted to demonstrate that the Qiangtang Basin has been subjected to a megamonsoon climate with heavy precipitation during its northward movement since the Latest Permian but has been subjected to a dry environment due to moving into the northern hemisphere subtropic high zone in the Middle Triassic and monsoonal retreat in the early Late Jurassic (early Oxfordian) approximately 161 Ma. The coupling of the hot-dry climate and the close of the Meso-Tethys, along with sea retreat in the Late Jurassic, ensured a large potential time window for evaporite (potash) formation in the Qiangtang Basin, while the tropic megamonsoon rain forest in the Late Permian to the Early Triassic and in the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic favored the formation of coal and hydrocarbon source rocks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Exploring the interplay between the mid-latitude Westerlies and East Asian monsoon systems is crucial for revealing the mechanisms and processes behind the aridification of the central Asian interior. In this study, a high-resolution acid-dissolved Mn record of lacustrine sediments from a drilling core (SG-1) in the arid western Qaidam Basin on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) largely reveals the evolution of lake levels and climate change over the last 600 kyr. The climate in the western Qaidam Basin shows distinct glacial and interglacial changes in accordance with changes in the global climate, and in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs), indicating the teleconnection between the basinu0027s climate and the North Atlantic in the form of the Westerlies. However, the basinu0027s climate also correlates closely with East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) activity as recorded by the grain size variations in loess-paleosol sequences on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) over a glacial-interglacial timescale. Even during glacial periods, some relatively warm/humid stages accompanied by high paleolake levels in the western Qaidam Basin are generally conformable with relatively weak EAWM, whereas these warm/humid stages show a weak relation with the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and North Atlantic SSTs. These results collectively provide evidence that climate change in the western Qaidam Basin is, and was, not only controlled by the Westerlies, but also strongly influenced by the Siberian High, at least during glacial periods. The exact driving mechanism, however, needs to be explored further in future studies.",

        "abstract": "It has been long known that the magnetic susceptibility record of the Chinese loess correlates well with the marine benthic oxygen isotope record at the orbital bands during the last ∼0.8 Ma, suggesting that at the orbital scale, the phasing and periodicity of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) are controlled by northern ice volume but not by northern summer insolation. However, during the interval ∼2.8–0.8 Ma, there is poor correlation between the EASM record obtained from loess magnetic susceptibility and the global ice volume record obtained from marine benthic oxygen isotopes, arguing against control of the phasing and periodicity of the EASM by global ice volume. Here we show that during the interval ∼2.8–0.8 Ma the magnetic susceptibility record of the Chinese loess correlates well with the clipped and smoothed marine benthic oxygen isotope record from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean. The data thus suggest that the orbital-scale periodicity and phasing of the EASM are controlled by northern ice sheets during the entire ∼2.8 Ma, not just the last ∼0.8 Ma. We have shown that tectonic events during the Pliocene are the most plausible causes for the lack of correlation between the Chinese red clay magnetic susceptibility record and the marine benthic oxygen isotope record during the interval ∼4.5–2.7 Ma. We have also shown that the correlation between Chinese red clay magnetic susceptibility record and benthic oxygen isotope record between ∼6 and ∼4.5 Ma is remarkable. The work reported here is complementary to our previous work and indicate that the magnetic susceptibility record of the entire aeolian sequence on the Chinese loess plateau can be correlated with the marine benthic oxygen isotope record.",

        "abstract": "The spatial and temporal evolution of Artemisia and its relationship with the Tibetan Plateau (TP) uplift are examined by summarizing pollen data from 122 sites across China. The pollen morphological data reveal that Artemisia may have originated from the arid-semiarid middle latitudes of Asia in the late Eocene and spread west and east in the Oligocene as the result of early uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the global cooling. During the Miocene, Artemisia reached the southeastern part of the TP and became common in the western TP due to the high elevation in these regions. At the same time, the Asian monsoon prevented the spread of Artemisia to the southern part of the TP. Since the Pliocene, especially in the Pleistocene, Artemisia distribution was very similar to its current distribution, which indicates that the topography of the TP and the paleoenvironmental conditions in the East Asia became more like today. Thus, the Cenozoic origin and evolution of Artemisia in the Asia was strongly influenced by the uplift of the TP, global cooling, as well as monsoon development. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",

        "abstract": "As paleolatitude recorder, paleomagnetic inclination can provide constraints on the tectonic activities of studied block and play a crucial role in paleogeographic reconstructing. However, recent paleomagnetic data obtained from sedimentary rocks show a pronounced bias towards too-shallow inclinations. Therefore, how to precisely determine paleomagnetic inclination is a crucial key to understand latitudinal motion of blocks. This paper provides new detailed paleomagnetic results of the Middle-Later Jurassic sediments of the Yanshiping area in Qiangtang block, central Tibetan. The high quality paleomagnetic direction of the Quemocuo Formation is Ds=339.0°, Is=24.4°, α95=18.3°, whereas the overlying limestone layers of Buqu Formation is Ds=336.9, Is=30.9°, α95=7.8°. We then utilize an effective \"Elongation/Inclination\" statistic analysis method to correct the inclination bias caused by Syn- /or post-depositional compaction, which reveals 5.7°~8.5° of shallowing. The 3.7° differences of corrected inclinations between the above two adjacent formations indicate that the Qiangtang block has had ~278 km of northward adrift during the period. In addition, when comparing the corrected inclinations with the Tarim block of the same period, it reveals another 10.9°~14.6° inclination shallowing. It possibly indicates that there has been approximate of 1000 km convergences between the Qiangtang and Tarim blocks since the Middle Jurassic.",

        "abstract": "Although magnetic susceptibility (χ) is a widely accepted East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) intensity proxy for Quaternary loess, debates exist about whether χ can be used to indicate EASM intensity for the red-clay sequence. In order to use χ of the red-clay sediments to indicate EASM intensity, χ should have the same sort of enhancement mechanisms as in Quaternary loess. However, this similarity has not been rigorously demonstrated. Previous estimates of magnetic grain size distribution of Chinese loess and red-clay are based on out-of-phase magnetic susceptibility inversion technique. This technique assumes that the coercivity of pedogenic magnetic grains is independent of temperature, and at any temperature, only a single grain size contributes to frequency-dependent or quadrature susceptibility, rather than a distribution of sizes. Thermal fluctuation tomography is a recently developed more rigorous inversion technique for characterizing the grain-size distribution of superparamagnetic (SP) and single domain grains with fewer assumptions. Here we apply this technique to the Chinese red-clay sequence of the Chaona section, central Chinese Loess Plateau, and the overlying loess-paleosol sequence to better characterize the size distribution of SP grains of the Chinese red-clay sequence. We found that SP grain-size distributions of both paleosol and red-clay from the Chaona section are similar. The results reinforce a previous conclusion supporting the idea that magnetic susceptibility (χ) can be used to indicate the intensity of the EASM in the red-clay sequence. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The magnitude of fault offset, a key parameter of fault geometry and kinematics, provides critical information on the role of the Karakoram fault (KKF) in accommodating deformation of the Tibetan crust. Geologic markers used for estimating the magnitude of offset along the KKF include: (1) geomorphologic features, (2) correlative stratigraphic sequences, (3) ophiolite melange belts, (4) igneous bodies, and (5) regional fault systems. The debated offsets of the KKF range from 40. km to as much as 1000. km. Conflicting offsets may result from a lack of available offset correlations based on quantitative measurements. The Kunsha granite and the Ayilari granite provide another set of potential markers for estimating the offset along the KKF. U-Pb zircon ages and textural observations provide the basis for correlating these granites. Zircon U-Pb ages show that both the Kunsha granite and the South Ayilari granite crystallized around 50. Ma ago, whereas the North Ayilari granite formed mostly around 20. Ma ago. Reconstruction of batholiths on two sides of the Namru-Menshi basin, as well as the Yalung-Zangbo suture and the trace of the South Kailas thrust, show the offset along the KKF to be about 52±2. km. The chronologic data appear to preclude a 100. km offset, based on the correlation between the North Ayilari granite and the Kunsha granite. Our data further disproves the conjecture that the North Ayilari granite is synkinematic granite of the KKF, and thus contradicts a 280-400. km ophiolite melange belt offset, since it is based on the an incorrect fault initiation time. We calculate a slip rate of 4.5±0.1. mm/yr since 12. Ma, which implies that the average long-term slip rate is low. This does not support the lateral extrusion model, which predicts a high slip rate. It does support the concept that the collision between India and Eurasia proceeded by distributed deformation rather than lateral extrusion along faults that bound a rigid Tibet. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Sediments shed from the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, the Qilian Mountains, are widely deposited in the foreland basin, the Jiuxi Basin, archiving plenty of information about the mountain surface uplift and erosion history. The Laojunmiao section, 1960 m thick, representing the upper sequence of the Cenozoic basin sediments, is paleomagnetically dated to about 13-0 Ma BP. Detailed sedimentary study of this sequence has revealed five sedimentary facies associations which determine four stages of sedimentary environment evolution. They are: (I) the half-deep lake system before 12.18 Ma BP, (II) the shallow lake system between 12.18 and 8.26 Ma BP, (III) the fan delta dominated sedimentary system in dry climate between 8.26 and 6.57 Ma BP, and (IV) alluvial fan system since 6.57 Ma BP. The associated mountain erosion and uplift are suggested to have experienced three phases, that is, tectonic stable (13-8.26 Ma BP), gradual uplift (8.26-<4.96 Ma BP), and rapid intermittent uplift (>3.66-0 Ma BP). The uplift at Ο3.66 Ma BP is of great importance in tectonics and geomorphology. Since then, tectonic uplift and mountain building have been accelerated and become strong intermittent. At least three significant tectonic events took place with ages at <1.80-1.23, 0.93-0.84 and 0.14 Ma BP, respectively. Thus, the uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau is a complex process of multiple phases, unequal speed and irregular movements.",

Paleomagnetic results throughout Xining Basin strata, recently dated using magnetostratigraphy to between 52 and 17 Ma, show that some 25° of clockwise rotation with respect to the stable Eurasian continent occurred at ca. 41 Ma. In view of a regional compilation of existing paleomagnetic data from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, these results suggest that this region experienced clockwise rotations in the regional Paleocene-Miocene basin system, including rotation in the Xining Basin, ca. 41 Ma, thus establishing the existence of widespread deformation at this time. During a mid-Miocene phase, between 17 and 11 Ma, clockwise rotations were restricted to the Miocene-Quaternary basin system, implying that the Laji Shan thrust belt, which separates the two basin systems, was active during this time interval.",

        "title": "Magnetostratigraphic and radiometric constraints on salt formation in the Qaidam Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau",
        "abstract": "The Qaidam Basin is the largest Cenozoic intermontane basin within the northeast (NE) Tibetan Plateau. It contains large amounts of nonmarine evaporite deposits formed during the Pliocene-Quaternary. Even at present, extensive salt deposits dominated by halite and potash are formed by solar-driven concentration of brine water in the basin interior, making it the most important industrial base for potash exploitation in China. The formation of salt required an arid climatic, appropriate hydrological and tectonic setting through geologic times and will do so in the future. Studying the salt formation in the Qaidam Basin will enhance our understanding of processes driven by saline lake evolution, regional climate change, and tectonic movements, not only for the setting of the Tibetan Plateau. Reliable dating is crucial for assessing the time of salt formation in Qaidam Basin and the accumulation process, yet no comprehensive scientific studies have been reported on this important issue until now. In this paper, we critically review and compile magnetostratigraphic and radiometric studies of the salt-bearing strata within seven depressions of the basin. We find that the ages of salt formation are very different in these depressions: for the Dalangtan, Yiliping, Chahansilatu, and Kunteyi depressions, first salt deposits occurred at >3.90±0.02Ma, 2.88±0.04Ma, 2.24±0.01Ma and 1.18±0.02Ma, respectively. For the Mahai, Gasikule, and Qarhan, the ages of earliest salt formation are much younger i.e., 302±56ka, 608±38ka, and 54-24ka, respectively. However, the result from Mahai has to be considered with caution. The variability of ages suggests an older salt-forming stage in the center of the western basin and a younger salt accumulation period along the basin margin. In a regional view, previous results from stratigraphy, sedimentology, geomorphology, and tectonic history allow us to conclude that the salt formation in the Qaidam Basin was probably controlled by pulsed intrabasinal tectonic movements and the distribution and migration of paleo-rivers during the Pliocene-Quaternary. However, the climatic shift towards drier and colder conditions in the Asian interior during this time also promoted salt formation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian follicular atresia is characterized by granulosa cell apoptosis, however, the exact mechanism is still unclear. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, which is associated with apoptosis in several of cell types, but its exact role in ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis is not clearly defined. In present study, we identified the involvement of SIRT1 in the process of follicle degeneration, which is known as \"follicular atresia\", both from in vivo models and cell culture data. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that SIRT1 was widely detected in non-apoptotic granulosa cells of follicles, but significantly decreased during the process of granulosa cell apoptosis. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of SIRT1 mRNA and protein were increased (P<0.05) during follicular atresia. In order to provide more evidences elucidating the roles of SIRT1 during the process of follicular atresia, granulosa cells were cultured in vitro with resveratrol which acts as a potent activator of SIRT1. Results showed that resveratrol caused a dose-dependent increase in both SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels. Meanwhile, apoptotic rate of granulosa cell was increased (P<0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, resveratrol significantly increased the expression levels of Caspase-3 (P<0.01) and Bax mRNA (P<0.01), while Bcl-2 mRNA level was significantly decreased (P<0.01). Thus, our results suggest that SIRT1 may play important roles in the regulation of granulosa cell apoptosis during follicular atresia in porcine ovary.",

        "abstract": "Up to 23 paleosols have been identified in loess sequences that overlie fluviatile sediments on seven terraces of Huang He (the Yellow River) and Daxia He in the Linxia Basin at the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The magnetostratigraphic record in the oldest sequence appears to be fairly complete and spans the entire Quaternary. It includes evidence for the Jaramillo and Olduvai normal polarity subchrons within the Matuyama chron, as well as the Cobb Mountain and \"stage 54\" (formerly Gilsa) events. Age constraints within the Brunhes are provided by 4C and thermoluminescence/optical stimulated luminescence dating. The magnetostratigraphic chronology of the Quaternary sediments indicates that terraces were formed at about 1.66, 1.4, 1.1, 0.6, 0.12, 0.05 5, and 0.01 Ma. The terraces may represent climatically induced pauses in long-term tectonically induced incision by the rivers. On the basis of terrace heights and ages, incision rates were highest from 1.66 to 1.4 Ma (- 1 m/kyr), decreased from 1.4 to 0.12 Ma (- 0.1 m/kyr), and increased from 0.12 Ma to present ( 0.75 m/kyr). If river incision is attributed solely to uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, then this uplift appears to have been rapid as well as intermittent following the first evidence of the existence of Huang He in this area at about 1.75 Ma. However, the effects of uplift cannot be fully separated from incision caused by changes in climate.",

Grain size analysis of the Chengdu Clay at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau indicates a rapid increase of coarse fractions at around 500 ka, suggesting a significant drying event in the source region. Comparison with results from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) indicates that this drying event occurred on a regional scale and may imply an important drying event in eastern Asia. We estimate that the rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during the middle Pleistocene may be one of the most important causes of the significant drying in the area.",

In the Hexi Corridor, north periphery of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the angular unconformity between the Jiuquan\n Gravel and the Yumen Conglomerate has been well known to represent an intensive tectonic event of the plateau. However, its\n age is poorly constrained. Our paleomagnetic dating at the Laojunmiao section in the Jiuxi Basin show that the bottom of the\n Jiuquan Gravel reaches 0.84 MaBP, the top of the Yumen Conglomerate is about 0.93 MaBP.

        "abstract": "Carbonates from fluvial and lacustrine sediments were sampled from multiple measured sections in the Linxia basin of western China. Based on textural and mineralogical evidence, lacustrine carbonates are primary precipitates from lake water. A 29 million year record of the oxygen isotope composition of meteoric water is inferred from the δ 18 O values of these carbonates. This inference is based on the most negative δ 18 O values in the lake carbonates, which represent lake waters that have experienced the least evaporative enrichment. Carbonate δ 18 O values, a proxy for rainfall δ 18 O, are ∼−10.5‰ throughout the interval of 29–12 Ma. At 12 Ma there is a shift to −9‰, a value that remains into the Pliocene. This implies a major reorganization of atmospheric circulation patterns and a shift to more arid conditions at the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau with the post-12 Ma system similar to that of today. The 12 Ma event may represent the time at which the Tibetan plateau achieves sufficient elevation to block the penetration of moisture from the Indian Ocean or south Pacific into western China. The period of greatest aridity is from 9.6 to 8.2 Ma, a time interval which agrees well with other climate records.",

The results show that the evolution of faults can be divided into two relatively fast phases: 1) During the deposit time between the Lulehe Fm. and the Upper Xia. Ganchaigou Fm. (~54~31 Ma). 2) Since the deposit time of the Xia Youshashan Fm. (~22 Ma~present). The latter phase was more robust, especially since~8 Ma (since the deposit time of the Shizigou Fm.), the NWW faults begin to active significantly which indicates the most drastic tectonic collision process. Quantitative analysis of the proxy of the growth faults also correspond with the two phases. Together these indicate that the collision between Indian and Eurasia continents has a two-stages feature after~55 Ma they will provide some new convincible evidence for the multi-stages uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau.",

It is formed in a synchronous manner with dust transported from the Gurbantunggut Desert in the Junggar Basin.\n The thickest section of loess was found in the Shawan and Shihezi regions. Paleomagnetic and climatic proxy analyses of over\n 71 m of a loess-paleosol sequence on the highest terrace of the Qingshui He (River) in the Shawan show that the paleomagnetic\n Bruhues/Matuyama (B/M) boundary lies at the bottom of paleosol S8, at a depth of 69.5 m, and the bottom of the sequence was\n estimated to be ∼0.8 Ma. This implies that the extremely dry climatic conditions in the Junggar Basin and the initial Gurbantunggut\n Desert were present at least by 0.8 Ma. High-resolution grain size series demonstrate that this area and desert expansion\n experienced two dramatic periods of desert expansions that occurred at ∼0.65 Ma and 0.5 Ma, respectively; and the subsequent\n continuous enhancement led to the environment presently observed. This tremendous environmental effect, caused by large-scale\n expansion of the desert and arid region of inner Asia, might be an important driving force for the global temperature drop\n that occurred in the mid-Pleistocene.",

        "abstract": "Pressed by the northward movement of the Indian Plate, The crust in the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) area was uplifted during the Late Cenozoic, which exerts a great influence on East Asian environment. The Qinghai-Xizang area was subject to two cycles of uplift and plantation in the Tertiary. The Plateau had raised up to about 2 000 m above sea level during 25 Ma BP ~ 17 Ma BP. This, coupled with favorable continent-ocean configuration at that time, may have triggered Asia monsoon, which replaced previously dominated planetary wind system and led to a big environmental shift in China in the Middle-Tertiary because of global cooling and plantation in Xizang. Monsoon decreasing resulted in intensification of the Asian dry climate after 8 Ma BP. The rapid uplift of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau in the Last 3.4 Ma had enhanced in a great deal again the summer monsoon, leading to moistening of the northern Plateau and even North China. On the other hand, the intensification of winter monsoon resulted in deposition of Loess at 2.5 Ma BP in North China. The subsequent tectonic movement of Mid-Pleistocene (0.8 Ma BP~0.5 Ma BP) might raise the Plateau up to about 3 000 m~3 500 m above sea level. This coupled with temperature drop by periodicity shift in the earth orbit, and led the Plateau to enter the iceosphere and form the maximum glaciating with ice cover of over 500 000 km2. Because of strengthen of winter monsoon, desert in the northwest China was enlarged and Loess sediment expanded far to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Intense tectonic uplift happening in the last 150 ka, led to significant change of many local drainage system in the plateau. Based on 150 ka high-resolution climatic records from the Guliya ice core, lake cores at Tianshuihai and Zoige, and loess profile at Linxia, it is found that the climate in MIS 5e was especially warm. The ice core record indicated temperature at 125 ka BP was 5°C higher than that of today and climate was unstable in MIS 5e in the plateau, which was revealed also by loess and lake core records. The deglaciation since 15 ka BP was characterized by a clear identification of the Younger Dry as event at ac.. 12 ka BP followed by largely fluctuation rising of temperature with its warmest peak at 7 ka BP, corresponded with increase of precipitation, expansion of lakes. After 5 ka BP, temperature decreased again in fluctuation, accompanied with environmental deterioration. Repeated leveling indicates that the Plateau is still in rapid rising at an average rate of 5.8 mm/a in present time.",

        "abstract": "The application of magnetic proxies in paleoclimate studies has the advantage of fast and non-destructive measurement procedures, which is an important precondition for obtaining high-resolution datasets within a manageable time frame. Here we demonstrate the advantage of using magnetic proxies for a ~940-m-long drill core comprising lacustrine sediments from the Qaidam Basin (NE Tibetan Plateau), which was previously dated by magnetostratigraphy and optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Comparison of three independent mass-specific magnetic susceptibility (χ) datasets confirms the horizontal homogeneity of the drill core at scales of several cm3. The potential linkage of χ to astronomical forcing is suggested by spectral analysis. Magnetic grain size- and mineralogy-dependent parameters were used to evaluate possible scenarios explaining the χ variation. Moreover, using additional palynological results we demonstrate the correlation of χ with climatic constraints, thereby showing the climate sensitivity of χ. Higher and lower χ values are related to dry and more humid conditions, respectively. Our results lead us to conclude that χ variations are caused by the interference of two driving mechanisms: low-temperature oxidation in the catchment area and a changing catchment area. In summary, this study confirms the informative value of magnetic proxies for detecting paleoenvironmental change in high resolution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",

        "title": "Intensification of the Asian winter monsoon after 7.4 Ma: Grain-size evidence from the Linxia Basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, 13.1 Ma to 4.3 Ma",
        "abstract": "Grain-size studies of eolian deposits (loess and Red Clay) on the Chinese Loess Plateau have produced a detailed history of the Asian winter monsoon covering the last 8 Ma. This paper extends the gain-size record back to 13.1 Ma in the Linxia basin, at the northeast edge of the Tibetan Plateau. By comparing the grain-size distribution of the Linxia basin sediment with known eolian sediments in the region we argue that the 10–70 μm fraction is mostly eolian. This fraction becomes increasingly dominant in the record after 7.4 Ma, with almost all sediments eolian in origin after 6.2 Ma. Given that the 10–70 μm fraction in the Linxia basin are well sorted and have grain-size spectra that are very similar to sediments transported by the Asian winter monsoon, we suggest that the continuous presence of this fraction throughout our record indicates that the Asian winter monsoon has been present in some form since 13.1 Ma. If the assumption that variation in grain-size spectra on the million-year time scale is primarily controlled by the character of eolian input to the basin is valid, the long-term pattern of the eolian fraction reveals two abrupt intensifications of the Asian winter monsoon at 7.4 Ma and 5.3 Ma. These are superimposed on a gradual intensification of the Asian winter monsoon beginning at 8.0–7.4 Ma. We note that the two abrupt intensifications may be related to Arctic ice volume increase, and that the gradual intensification of the Asian winter monsoon after 7.4 Ma is accompanied by central Asia desertification and may therefore be related to increase in the height or extent of the Tibetan Plateau.",

        "abstract": "The Xianshuihe fault system (XSF) is one of the most active faults in eastern Tibet, China. In this study, we document the distribution of stream deflections along the Ganzi-Yushu segment of the XSF at scales of 2.5 m to 80 km. The total offset along this fault suggests that left-lateral movement began at ∼8-5.6 Ma if the Holocene slip rate has remained steady over this time interval. From Dengke in the southeast to Dangjiang in the northwest along the Ganzi-Yushu fault, the documented total geological offset decreases from ∼80 to ∼39 km, whereas the deflections of the Yalong, Batang, Jielong, and Dangjiang rivers, almost all of which initiated around early Quaternary time, show gradually decreasing offsets from 30 ± 2 km to 16 ± 1 km in the same direction. This implies that about 41 km and 14 km offset are accommodated by transtensional and transpresional structures such as pullapart basins and thrust faults along different parts of the fault at different times; this is also consistent with a northwestward decrease in the Holocene slip rate along the XSF, from 10 to 14 mm/yr around Dengke to ∼7 mm/yr around Dangjiang. Thus the spatial and temporal evolution of stream patterns along the XSF supports the hypothesis that the tectonic evolution of eastern Tibet is largely characterized by distributed deformation.

        "title": "An Eocene-Miocene continuous rock magnetic record from the sediments in the Xining Basin, NW China: indication for Cenozoic persistent drying driven by global cooling and Tibetan Plateau uplift",
        "abstract": "Tibetan Plateau uplift and global cooling have generally been thought to have caused the drying of the Asian inland, but how and when these factors drove the aridification is unknown. The Xining Basin at the NE Tibetan Plateau received continuous Eocene-Miocene fine-grained sediments, providing an excellent opportunity to address this question. Here we present detailed rock magnetic and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) analyses for a well-dated Cenozoic sedimentary record from the Xiejia section in the basin. Magnetic susceptibility (chi), saturation magnetization (Ms) and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) in this section show a long-term decreasing trend from similar to 52 to similar to 25 Ma, well coinciding with global cooling and drying in the region, and an increasing trend since similar to 25 Ma, which is in contrast to the further progressing aridification of the basin. Thermomagnetic results and DRS-determined hematite contents suggest that the relative content of magnetite and hematite is the main control on the chi, Ms and SIRM values. We argue that the long-term Eocene-Oligocene global cooling increased the drying of the Asian inland, lowering the lake level and exposing a larger area to low temperature oxidation for longer times, thus producing more hematite and leading to the decreasing trend of magnetic concentration parameters from similar to 52 to similar to 25 Ma. An intensive uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau since similar to 25 Ma, associated with a change in the sedimentary source, might be responsible for the increase of chi, Ms and SIRM after 25 Ma.",

        "abstract": "Studies of the geomorphology and stratigraphy in the upper reaches of the Yellow River during the late Cenozoic demonstrate that the period of 30-3.4Ma is charactered by a relatively stable tectonic setting, a persistently hot climate and a wide distribution of inland basins. This long-term stable environment resulted in a planation surface, the main surface on the Qinghai-Xizang (Qingzang) Plateau, on which red earth crust and karst are formed. Since 3.4 Ma, the Qingzang Plateau was uplifted as a whole massif accompanied by the dissection and disintegration of the main surface, termination of deposition and deformation of stratigraphy in red basins, increasing relief and commencing accumulation of inland molasse formation mainly of conglomerate. Subsequent strong uplift of the Qingzang Plateau at 2.5Ma and 1.7-1.66Ma led to cormation of the basic geomorphological configuration of the Qingzang Plateau and occurrence of the Yellow River. These three strong uplifts of the Qingzang Plateau between 3.4 Ma and 1.7-1.66Ma was therefore, named the Qingzang movement and divided correspondingly into three phases A, B and C. After the appearance of the Yellow River, the Qingzang Plateau continued uplifting intermittently, resulting in 8 valley terraces dated to 1.63, 1.5, 1.2, 0.8, 0.6, 0.15, 0.05, and 0.01 Ma, which also record the whole process of headward erosion of the Yellow River.",

The mechanism to form dust storm and precipitation was almost same according to the principle of synoptic meteorology, namely, the dust storm and precipitation could occur simultaneously in theory. But, in inter-annual and longer time scale, there was a significant negative feedback mechanism between the number of dust storm days and precipitation. It was reverse compared with the positive feedback mechanism from the principle of synoptic meteorology. The theory that precipitation suppresses dust storm occurring might explain these facts that the negative relationship between the number of dust storm days and precipitation in inter-annual and long time scale, but could not explain the observed fact that the relationship was positive in monthly scale. By analyzing the cloud coverage, dust condensation nucleus and cloud drop effective radius from the Aqua satellite data, a mass of dust aerosol as condensation nuclei effectively caused the reduction of cloud drop effective radius to fail to reach the threshold and thus suppressed the precipitation. The theory may be a good explanation of the above-mentioned logic contradiction and provides a new view of the mechanism of feedback between precipitation and dust aerosol.",

        "abstract": "The Late Cenozoic red clay-loess sequence in the Chinese Loess Plateau provides a high-resolution record of paleoclimatic and tectonic changes related to the phased uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. Detailed magnetostratigraphy of a recently recovered 125-m-thick sediment sequence from the central Chinese Loess Plateau shows that the red clay began to accumulate at ca. 8.1 Ma, implying a marked drying in the interior of Asian as well as the initial establishment of the East Asian paleomonsoon regime. Prior to 3.8 Ma, the ferromagnetic mineral concentrations, as revealed by both magnetic susceptibility and S-ratios, exhibit a cyclic pattern superimposed upon a linear trend. This pattern collapsed immediately after 3.8 Ma, suggesting a change in source area. This in turn may have resulted from the reorganization of atmospheric circulation and the onset of the modern Asian monsoon, probably associated with the accelerated uplift of the Tibetan Plateau to a certain threshold elevation. Keywords Red clay formation Magnetostratigraphy Rock magnetism Neogene Atmospheric circulation reorganization Chinese Loess Plateau 1 Introduction The loess-paleosol sequences in the Chinese Loess Plateau have long been regarded as the most complete and high-resolution terrestrial archives of paleoclimate and environmental changes during the Quaternary (cf. Heller and Liu, 1982; Liu et al., 1985; Kukla and An, 1989 ). Generally, these loess-paleosol sequences are in sharp contact with the underlying reddish clay/silt-sized sediments referred to as the “Red Clay formation”. This group of sediments is well known for a wealth of mammalian fossils, especially Hipparion ; therefore, it is also named the “ Hipparion red earth”. Field observations, magnetostratigraphic measurements as well as geochemical, sedimentological, and micromorphological analyses over recent years revealed that the red clay was deposited continuously during the Miocene–Pliocene with an eolian origin associated with the drying of the Asian interior and the evolution of the East Asian monsoon due to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau ( Sun et al., 1997; Rea et al., 1998; Ding et al., 1998, 2001; Qiang et al., 2001; An et al., 2001; Guo et al., 2001, 2002, 2004; Zheng et al., 2004; Song et al., 2005 ). The thickness of the red clay sections in the central Loess Plateau generally varies from tens of meters to more than one hundred meters ( Song et al., 2005 ), thereby providing long-term insight into the paleoclimatic dynamics related to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in the Asian interior. Here, we report a newly obtained data set of magnetostratigraphy and rock magnetism from a continuous 125-m-thick red clay sequence from the central Chinese Loess Plateau, which can be used to study the evolution of East Asian monsoon and the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. 2 Geologic settings The Chinese Loess Plateau is subdivided into two parts by the NW-SE striking Liupan Mountains ( Fig. 1 ). They are the Longzhong Basin to the west and the Ordos Platform to the east. Sedimentologically, the large Longzhong Basin, developed in the Cenozoic, is dominated by late Tertiary fluvial/lacustrine red-beds ( Li et al., 1997 ). The tectonically stable Ordos Platform has experienced widespread erosion since the Late Cretaceous, resulting in the formation of a gently sloping planation surface ( Yang, 1993 ). The platform was tectonized due to the continued uplift of the Tibetan Plateau ( Tapponnier et al., 1990; Burchfiel et al., 1991; Zhang et al., 1991 ), therefore several blocks were formed during the late Cenozoic ( Song, 2001 ). The western margin of the Ordos platform was uplifted, forming what is now the Liupan Mountains, whereas the eastern part was subjected to a relative subsidence, giving rise to a stable surface where red-clay and loess deposits accumulated ( Song, 2001; Song et al., 2005 ). The modern climate of the Chinese Loess Plateau is governed by the East Asian monsoon system. In summer, warm and moist airmasses from the Pacific prevail over this area; in winter, cold fronts from Siberia High Press predominate ( Fig. 1 ). The annual mean temperature and precipitation are about 13 °C and 600 mm at Lingtai county, Gansu Province. 3 Stratigraphy and fieldwork The red clay section is situated at Chaona town (107.2°E, 35.1°N) in Lingtai County ( Fig. 1 ). The entire Late Cenozoic sediment sequence is about 300 m thick, consisting of a 175-m-thick Quaternary loess-paleosol sequence and 125-m-thick Tertiary red clay, which reseats unconformably on the Early Cretaceous gray sandstone. The red clay sequences are naturally exposed in two outcrops incised by tributaries of the Daxi River in the middle Yellow River area. The two sediment sequences can be readily correlated according to stratigraphic markers such as nodule layers, and the correlation was subsequently confirmed in laboratory by magnetic susceptibility and grain-size measurements. The red clay sediments are predominantly composed of reddish soils and calcareous nodules especially in the upper part of the sections. Generally, the color of the lower part is lighter than that of the upper part. The red clay sequences can be subdivided into five lithologic units (referred to as RC-I to RC-V hereafter). The first unit (RC-I) occurs from the loess-red clay boundary at 175.5–193 m. The color of this unit is amaranthine and much redder than that of the surrounding units. The soils are well developed with relatively abundance of clay and Fe–Mn coatings. The second unit (RC-II) lies between 193 and 219 m. The soils are weakly developed with a light brown-red color. This unit is marked by five gray-white nodule layers with a thickness ranging from 40 to 80 cm. The third unit (RC-III) is defined between 219 and 244 m. It is the reddest unit in the entire red clay sequence, with dark-brow and well-developed Fe–Mn coatings and many large nodules. The fourth unit (RC-IV), from 244 to 273 m, is composed of light brown-red soils and small nodules. From 273 m to bottom is the fifth unit (RC-V), which has a relatively weak pedogenesis, and consists of yellow-brown soils and very few nodules with relatively small size. The sequence was continuously sampled at 10–20 cm intervals for rock magnetic analyses. Oriented bulk samples also were taken at 0.5–1 m intervals for paleomagnetic measurements. 4 Laboratory procedure Each oriented bulk sample was split into three sets of parallel cubic specimens with a dimension of 2 × 2 × 2 cm for paleomagnetic analysis. Remanences of the first set of the specimens were measured using a Schonstedt DSM-2 spinning magnetometer and 11 steps of alternating field demagnetization at 5–10 mT intervals. Some samples were thermally demagnetized at 15 steps at 10–50 °C intervals in the paleomagnetic Laboratory of Lanzhou University. The second set of the specimens was measured with a 2G cryogenic magnetometer (Model 760) by applying 15–20 step thermal demagnetization at 20–50 °C intervals from room temperature to 680 °C in the Laboratory of Paleomagnetism and Rock Magnetism in Kyoto University. Both the demagnetizer and magnetometer are assembled in a magnetically shielded room to avoid contamination by viscous magnetization. As a whole, the results of thermal demagnetization are better than that of alternating-field demagnetization. The representative progressive thermal demagnetization plots show the presence of two components ( Fig. 2 ). The first component is unblocked at low temperatures generally below 200 °C. The direction of this component is identical with the present geomagnetic field and thus is a viscous overprint. After removing the low temperature component, the direction becomes relatively stable and the vector tends to the origin on the orthogonal plot. Therefore, remanence data normally at 250–300 °C are used to determine the polarity zones. Magnetic susceptibility was measured on all air-dried samples with a Bartington MS-2 susceptometer at Lanzhou University. Both low-frequency (0.47 kHz) and high-frequency (4.7 kHz) susceptibilities ( χ L and χ H , respectively) were determined. The frequency-dependent susceptibility ( χ FD ) has been defined as ( χ L − χ H )/ χ L × 100 (%). Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility was measured using a system coupled to the Kappabridge (KLY-3) and CS-3 equipment from room temperature to 700 °C in argon gas at Lanzhou University. A maximum field of 1.0 T and a back field of 0.3 T were in turn applied to each sample to obtain isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) using an alternating gradient field magnetometer (Micromag™ 2900) at Kyoto University. The results are presented as the ratio of remanences in these two fields, in terms of the S-ratio. 5 Results 5.1 Magnetostratigraphy The magnetostratigraphy of the Chaona section is shown in Fig. 3 . We put the Matuyama/Gauss boundary at the oldest loess unit (L33). Our interpretation is consistent with previous results from other loess-red clay sections in neighboring areas ( Sun et al., 1998; Ding et al., 1998, 2001 ). Below the Matuyama/Gauss boundary are two reversed zones, which can be correlated to the Kaena and Mammoth events (i.e. subchrons 2An.1r and 2An.2r) in the geomagnetic polarity time scale of Cande and Kent (1995) . Accordingly, the zone between 203.6 and 248.4 m can be assigned to the Gilbert reversed polarity Chron. Thus, the four normal polarity events within this zone correspond to the Cochiti, Nunivak, Sidujfall and Thvera events, respectively. The other two normal zones at 248.4–254.4 m and 258.5–268.4 m can be correlated to 3An.1n and 3An.2n subchrons, respectively. The reversed polarity between 268.4 and 276.5 m corresponds to Chron 3Ar. A complex of normal and reversed polarity events between 276.5 m and between 289.4 m can only be correlated to Chron 3Bn, although two brief normal events are not identified because of larger sampling interval (1 m). Thus, the last two normal events can be interpreted as 4n.1n and 4n.2n. Based on this interpretation, the red clay formation was deposited from the top of reverse polarity of 4r.1r, about 8.1 Ma. On the context, it is well documented that the red clay sediments in the central Chinese Loess Plateau are eolian origin (cf. Sun et al., 1997, 1998; Ding et al., 1998; Song, 2001; Liu et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005 ). Eolian origin now has been generally accepted for the red clay of the central Loess Plateau. Field observations, lithological and sedimentological revealed that the red clay at Chaona section is wind-blown in origin ( Song, 2001 ). The characteristics of the grain size distribution suggest that the red clay sediments at Chaona section are also eolian origin ( Lü et al., 2001 ), thus extending the eolian record in the central Chinese Loess Plateau to at least 8.1 Ma. 5.2 Magnetic susceptibility The low-field mass-specific magnetic susceptibility of the Chaona red clay section ( Fig. 4 a) varies between 17 × 10 −8 and 232 × 10 −8 m 3 kg −1 , and the frequency-dependent susceptibility ( χ FD ) fluctuates between 2.1% and 19.1% ( Fig. 4 b). The mean susceptibility value (ca. 70 × 10 −8 m 3 kg −1 ) of the red clay sequence is generally lower than that of the paleosol in loess (ca. 88 × 10 −8 m 3 kg −1 ). The most striking feature is that the mass susceptibility curve of the Chaona red clay sequence can be divided into two stages (I and II) at 208.2 m, corresponding to ca. 3.8 Ma. The low-field susceptibility tends to increase gradually with values relatively lower than the mean value (47 × 10 −8 m 3 kg −1 ) throughout stage I. A nearly sinusoidal fluctuation superimposed upon this linear trend can be observed; and seven susceptibility peaks occur at 212, 234, 252 and 278 m ( Fig. 4 a). Ages of these peaks can be assigned to 4.0, 5.0, 5.9 and 6.9 Ma, respectively. The frequency-dependent susceptibility shows a similar pattern of variations but with relatively large amplitude during this period ( Fig. 4 b). Fluctuations of magnetic susceptibility curves indicate a strong 1 Ma quasi-cycle before 3.8 Ma. A rapid increase in mass susceptibility occurred around 3.8 Ma, synchronous with the collapse of the cyclic pattern. 5.3 S-ratio records Magnetic susceptibility ( χ ) is a function of magnetic mineralogy, concentration and granulometry ( Thompson and Oldfield, 1986 ). Concerning the magnetic concentration in paleosols, a leading hypothesis is that the enrichment of superparamagnetic grains (usually ⩽0.03 μm) mostly occurred during pedogenesis ( Maher and Taylor, 1998; Zhou et al., 1990 ). Magnetic susceptibility in loess and paleosol in the Chinese Loess Plateau has widely been employed as a proxy of East Asian summer monsoon intensity ( An, 2000 ). The magnetic susceptibility in paleosols is a measure of the concentration of ultrafine magnetic minerals, which is intimately related to the precipitation, pedogenesis and vegetation. It likewise can be used as an indicator of the summer monsoon in red clay sediements (cf. An et al., 1999; An, 2000; Lü et al., 2001; Qiang et al., 2001 ). Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of low-field susceptibility and natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of representative samples from the lower (Unit RC-III) and upper (Unit RC-I) parts of the section. The high-temperature susceptibility of samples from Unit RC-III remains stable below 200 °C, whereas above the temperature it decreases gradually until about 580 °C. The decreases in susceptibility slow down until the lowest value is reached at about 690 °C. The cooling curve is almost the same as the heating one ( Fig. 5 a). These features clearly show a presence of magnetite and hematite. The thermal demagnetization of NRM shows a minor drop between 500 and 580 °C and a complete removal at 690 °C ( Fig. 5 c), supporting the presence of magnetite and hematite. Furthermore, a slight drop at 580 °C in remanence ( Fig. 5 c), together with relatively higher contribution to susceptibility by hematite over magnetite ( Fig. 5 a), may indicate a higher proportion of hematite over magnetite because magnetic susceptibility of pure magnetite is about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of pure hematite ( Thompson and Oldfield, 1986 ). Samples from the uppermost unit (RC-I) of the red clay shows a quite similar pattern in both curves to that from the lower part, except that: (1) below 100–120 °C, the susceptibility increases gradually but NRM decays very quickly; and (2) compared with samples from the lower part, a distinct drop of remanance at about 580 °C and relatively smaller contribution of hematite to susceptibility can be observed ( Fig. 5 d). We consider to possibilities: one is due to the Neel temperature of goethite at about 120 °C, and the other is the much higher proportion of magnetite to hematite than that in samples from the lower part. Gradual decreases in high-temperature susceptibility from 200 to 500 °C ( Fig. 5 b) may indicate the presence of maghemite, which is also supported by the higher χ FD ( Fig. 4 b). Further evidence comes from our measurements of S-ratio of the red clay ( Fig. 4 c). S-ratio is a good indicator of the proportion of magnetite to hematite. Here S-ratio is defined as [(−IRM −0.3 T /SIRM) + 1]/2. Higher S-ratio indicates more content of magnetite than hematit ( King and Channell, 1991 ). The average S-ratio of samples from the lower part (208.2–300 m, 491 samples in total) and the upper part (208.2–177 m, 178 samples in total) is about 0.88 and 0.93, respectively. These values are consistent with the above conclusion. We conclude that the low-field susceptibility of the red clay is controlled by magnetic mineralogy and its concentration. We further believe that the highly enhanced susceptibility in the upper part of the red clay section was caused by greater concentration of magnetite and maghemite relative to hematite than in the lower part. 6 Discussion Evidence of high-resolution magnetostratigraphy suggests that the deposition of red clay in the central Loess Plateau began as early as 8.1 Ma. Our date is about 1 Ma earlier than the previously dated sections in the neighboring areas ( Sun et al., 1997; Ding et al., 1998, 2001 ). It is well documented that uplift of the Tibetan Plateau is the main factor contributing to the drying out and desertification of the Asian continental interior ( Kutzhach et al., 1993 ) and Asian Monsoon climate ( Ruddiman and Kutzbach, 1989; An, 2000; An et al., 2001 ). Eolian sediments in the Loess Plateau are mostly transported by westly circulation from Asian interior and East Asian winter Monsoon ( An, 2000 ). The widespread deposition of wind-blown red clay in the Chinese Loess Plateau implies a significant drying in the Asian interior at about 8.1 Ma. Magnetic susceptibility and the eolian accumulation rate of the red clay deposits can be regarded as summer monsoon strength and winter monsoon indices, respectively, for the Loess Plateau during the late Tertiary ( Sun et al., 1998 ). Rapid increases in the low-field susceptibility at about 3.8 Ma indicate the enhancement of East Asian summer monsoon. S-ratio also indicates a pronounced change in magnetic mineral composition and concentration. Prior to 3.8 Ma, the magnetic mineralogy was dominated by hematite, and subsequently, it was replaced by relative high proportion of magnetite. This change suggests a significant shift in the source area of the eolian red clay, most probably caused by the reorganization of the atmospheric circulation. Grain size distribution confirmed that the eolian sediments in the Chinese Loess Plateau are mainly transported by westly circulation and East Asian winter monsoon ( Sun, 2004 ). The finer fraction is transported by trade wind (westly circulation) in high altitude and the coarser fraction is most blown by East Asian circulation in high altitude land surface. Thus the changes of S-ratio reflect actually the fluctuations of intensities of westly and East Asian Monsoon. It has been demonstrated that the shifting of the central Siberian High Pressure (Which is the controlling climatic influence on East Asian winter monsoon) from 30°N to 50°N (present position) ( Ruddiman and Kutzbach, 1989 ) provided the forcing for eolian deposition in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The changes of magnetic mineralogy assemblage around 3.8 Ma maybe indicate that the Siberian High Pressure shifted towards northern and strengthened with uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. The East Asian circulation was enhanced; the desertification of neighboring northwestern or northern area became to deteriorate under strong Siberian High, and provided more dust to the Loess Plateau. On the other hand, the westly circulation have relative weak influence on the eolian deposits in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The main dust source of red clay sediments maybe change from Asian Interior to neighboring desert or Gobi area. Low altitude East Asian air circulation prevails in the Chinese Loess Plateau, which maybe suggest the establishment of modern East Asian system around 3.8 Ma. Moreover, the synchronously rapid increase in frequency-dependent susceptibility ( Fig. 4 b) suggests that the pedogenesis and the intensity of summer monsoon also had some influences at that time. The enhancement of East Asian summer monsoon maybe bring more warm and moist airmasses to East Asian from the Pacific, and increase precipitation in the Chinese Loess Plateau. Abundant rainfall and high or warm temperature is helpful to pedogenesis, it is also favorable to form new superparamagnetic grains or increase the concentration of ultrafine magnetic minerals ( Zhou et al., 1990 ). A little increment of magnetite will enlarge the magnetic susceptibility values greatly. When Indian plate thrust into Asia-Europe plate at the Middle Oligocene, the Liupan Mountains located along the northeastern margin of Tibetan was squeezed and began to initial uplift. Though the amplitude of uplift was not high, it was enough to divide the Loess Plateau into the eastern and the western part, the two parts developed different tectonic environment and erosion-accumulation process ( Song et al., 2005 ). The western part fell down tectonically, formed Longzhong Basin and developed Linxia group ( Fang et al., 2003 ). The eastern part belonged to Ordos platform, continued to rise and be eroded slowly, finally form a planation surface, it is difficult to reserve eolian or fluvial sediments under a continuous slow uplift process and erosion environment. The onset of red clay deposition also suggests a ca. 8.1 Ma tectonic event, which in turn terminated the development of the Ordos planation surface and led to the uplift of the Liupan Mountains. The plantation surface was broken by active fault and terminated development, and the Liupan Mountains began to slightly uplift. Landform and stratigraphical differences between western and eastern parts of the Loess Plateau began to be shaped. Because of the planation surface disintegration, the landform became more undulant and the lowlands were relatively easy to accept red clay deposits, while the highlands were unfavorable for the preservation of red clay deposits, if indeed any eolian red clay were present. The undulating nature of the broken planation surface may explain the thickness and chronological discrepancies among various cross-sections of red-clays deposits in the central Chinese Loess Plateau ( Song et al., 2005 ). The Shenyu section ( Fig. 1 ), located on the eastern pediment of the Liupan Mountains, is composed of 63 m late Tertiary red bed underlying several meters eolian loess. This red bed section with a basal paleomagnetic age of 8.1 Ma can be lithologically divided into three units with boundaries at 30.4 and 6.4 m in depth ( Song et al., 2001 ). There are alternative fluvial-lacustrine mud, sand and gravel sediments below 6.4 m in depth (about 3.8 Ma, paleomagnetic age). The upper unit (6.4–0 m in depth) is characterized by 11 interbedded brownish red Bt horizons and light brownish yellow Bk horizons with typical eolian origin. The lithological change in this section indicates that fluvial-lacustrine red-bed deposition was ended and eolian red clay began to accumulate around 3.8 Ma ( Song et al., 2001 ). The Liupan Mountains accelerated uplift since about 3.8 Ma at a large scale, which caused the rivers to incise deeply and the termination of fluvial and lacustrine development, typical eolian red clay appeared at this time in the Liupan Mountains ( Song et al., 2005 ). Since the Liupan Mountains are physically connected with the northern boundary faults of the Northern Tibetan Plateau ( Tapponnier et al., 1990; Burchfiel et al., 1991; Song et al., 2005 ), these tectonic events of the Liupan Mountains imply that the Tibetan Plateau experienced episodic uplifts 8.1 and 3.8 Ma, respectively. The tectonic uplift event at 8.0 Ma also is confirmed by fission track dating ( Zheng et al., 2006 ). Geomorphologic and sedimentological evidence from the Qilian Mountains suggests that the earliest uplift in the northern Tibetan Plateau occurred at about 8.6 Ma, and then the uplift rate increased gradually with a maximum occurred between 4.9 and 3.7 Ma ( Fang et al., 2004 ). Similar boulder conglomerated with nearly identical ages, has now been documented throughout northeastern Tibetan Plateau. These are interpreted to be the late Pliocene culmination of an accelerating tectonism that started ca. 8 Ma in the Late Miocene ( Zheng et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2005 ). A strong tectonic uplift of the southern Tibetan Plateau and Himalaya at about 8 Ma was widely recorded (cf. Harrison et al., 1992; Burbank et al., 1993 ). Therefore, the significant drying of Asian interior at about 8.1 Ma, as well as the change of atmospheric circulation and the enhancement of the Asian summer monsoon at about 3.8 Ma ( An, 2000; An et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005 ), might have largely resulted from the rapid and strong tectonic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. It maybe suggest that the Tibetan Plateau have reach a certain threshold elevation, which can change the atmospheric circulation. 7 Conclusion Detailed magnetostratigraphy of Chaona section shows that the eolian red clay began to accumulate at ca. 8.1 Ma, implying a marked drying in the interior of Asian as well as the initial establishment of the East Asian paleomonsoon regime. Prior to 3.8 Ma, the ferromagnetic mineral concentrations, as revealed by both magnetic susceptibility and S-ratios, exhibit a million years quasi-cyclic pattern superimposed upon a linear trend. This pattern collapsed immediately after 3.8 Ma, suggesting a change in dust source area from Asian Interior to neighboring deserts or Gobi. This in turn may have resulted from the reorganization of atmospheric circulation and the onset of the modern Asian monsoon, probably associated with the accelerated uplift of the Tibetan Plateau to a certain threshold elevation. East Asia Monsoon climate instead of westly circulation prevails in the Chinese Loess Plateau after 3.8 Ma.

        "title": "Variation of gypsum morphology along deep core SG-1, western Qaidam Basin (northeastern Tibetan Plateau) and its implication to depositional environments",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The Qaidam Basin is an arid, closed, intermontane basin located on the northern margins of the Tibetan Plateau in China. A 938.5 m-long core (SG-1), dated between ∼2.8 Ma–0.1 Ma, was obtained from the western Qaidam Basin. Gypsum is one of major evaporative minerals in the core. A total of 201 gypsum samples were selected and their crystal morphologies were carefully investigated. The crystal habits are lenticular, prismatic, tabular, twinned, stubby, and aggregate. Prismatic crystals occur in the upper 723 m, while lenticular crystals exist almost entirely in the upper 523 m. Tabular crystals are the most common morphology. The total abundance of gypsum crystal (including tabular, lenticular, and prismatic forms) tends to increase with decreasing depth. The relationship between crystal habits and depositional environments is complex, because same morphology can appear in different environments, and different morphologies can also occur in the same depositional environment. However, the occurrence of different morphologies can be attributed to the variable growth rates caused by the inhibition effect of additional cations (e.g. Mg 2+ , Na + , K +  and Sr 2+ ) on particular lattice parameters and the variation in precipitation experiments.  The lattice parameters of the unit cell of gypsum, measured by X-ray diffraction method, are:  a  = 5.854–12.57 A;  b  = 9.654–16.231 A; and  c  = 5.163–14.024 A; β = 113.54–119.88°; Volume = 601.55–712.65 A 3 . The substitution of K + , Na +  and Mg 2+  for Ca 2+  can reduce  c -axis, while Sr 2+  can reduce  a  and  b  axes.  a / c ,  b / c ,  a / b  tend to increase with K + , Na +  and Mg 2+  and decrease with Sr 2+ . The Mg 2+ , Na + , K +  and Sr 2+  contents in gypsum show significant variability, with K/Ca molar ratios varying from 1.03 × 10 −4  to 32.08 × 10 −4 , Mg/Ca molar ratios from 0.0023 to 0.1629, Na/Ca molar ratios from 0.031 to 0.575, and Sr/Ca molar ratios from 5.59 × 10 −4  to 19.67 × 10 −4 . Sr 2+ , Mg 2+ , Na + , and K +  concentrations in gypsum mainly depend on growth rate and brine concentration.",

        "title": "Cenozoic organic carbon isotope and pollen records from the Xining Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau, and their palaeoenvironmental significance",
        "abstract": "Marine oxygen isotope records show that the Cenozoic global climate has undergone remarkable fundamental changes. However, how terrestrial ecosystems respond to these changes remains unclear. The Xining Basin on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau holds continuous fine fluvial-lacustrine sediments from the early Eocene to the early Miocene (between ~52Ma and 17Ma). This paper first presents total organic carbon isotope (δ13CTOC) and pollen records from the Xiejia section in the Xining Basin, as indicators of the long-term terrestrial paleoecosystem and paleoclimate changes in the Asian interior of NW China. The δ13CTOC record shows a long term persistently decreasing trend (from ~-20‰ to -23.5‰) superimposed with obvious cycles of five distinctive phases of heavier and lighter δ13CTOC values, along with short pulses of especially low values occurring at ~32.5Ma, 23Ma, 21.5Ma, and 18Ma. These variations generally correlate with changes of gymnosperm content or the ratio of gymnosperm to angiosperm (G/A); i.e., heavier δ13CTOC values correspond with higher gymnosperm content or higher G/A, as well as with global temperatures (for both long term trends and shorter term fluctuations). We propose that global temperatures might provide the major factor controlling the evolution of the gymnosperm content (and the G/A ratio) that determines the δ13CTOC in the sediments. The East Asian monsoon may not have reached this region during the deposition of the sediments, or alternatively, its signals could not clearly be identified in these low resolution paleoecologic records. © 2013 .",

A ~. 1000-m-deep drilling (SG-1) with an average core recovery of ~. 95% was carried out in the depocenter of the Chahansilatu playa (sub-depression) in the western Qaidam Basin, aimed to obtain a high-resolution record of the paleoenvironmental evolution and the erosion history. Stepwise alternating field and thermal demagnetization, together with rock magnetic results, revealed a stable remanent magnetization for most samples, carried by magnetite. The polarity sequence consisted of 16 normal and 15 reverse zones which can be correlated with chrons 1n to 2An of the global geomagnetic polarity time scale. Magnetostratigraphic results date the entire core SG-1 at ~. 2.77. Ma to ~. 0.1. Ma and yielded sediment accumulation rate (SAR) ranging from 26.1. cm/ka to 51.5. cm/ka. Maximum SARs occurred within the intervals of ~. 2.6-2.2. Ma and after ~. 0.8. Ma, indicating two episodes of erosion, which we relate to pulse tectonic uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau with subsequent global cooling. © 2012 University of Washington.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies show that measuring AC magnetic susceptibility (with in-phase χ′ and quadrature χ″ components) versus temperature provides an effective way to map the grain-size distribution of pedogenic maghemite. Applying this method, we mapped the pedogenic maghemite grain-size distribution of samples of the red clay sediments deposited on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) during the interval 4.8–4.1 Ma, during which the validity of magnetic susceptibility as an East Asian summer monsoon precipitation intensity proxy has been questioned. The results show that the pedogenic maghemite grain-size distribution is the same as in the overlying loess-paleosol sequence and in the other intervals of the red clay sequence, suggesting similar pedogenesis mechanisms and marked precipitation seasonality on the CLP between 4.8 and 4.1 Ma compared with the other intervals. We argue that the seasonal position shift of the polar westerlies produces the required precipitation seasonality and thus produces a uniform pedogenic grain-size distribution during this time interval. Reconstructing paleo-rainfall on the central CLP on the basis of surface calibration results suggests that the intensification of the East Asian summer monsoon might be a key trigger for the subsequent significant ocean and cryosphere adjustments during the Pliocene.",

Sixty surface soil samples\n were collected from the eastern slope of Gongga Mountain, at elevations ranging from ∼1230 to 4500 m (eastern Tibetan Plateau),\n and from the northern slope of West Kunlun Mountains, ranging from ∼1300 to 5500 m (northern Tibetan Plateau). This study\n also analyzed the methoxy n-fatty acids (MFAs) of Gongga Mountain tree leaves from six common living species, at the elevation of 2900–4200 m. MFAs dominate\n these samples, with more centrally located methoxy groups eluting earlier than those with methoxy groups located closer to\n the end of the main carbon chain. MFAs occur prominently in most of the Gongga Mountain soil samples (and from six tree samples)\n from dominantly coniferous and deciduous broadleaved forests. Other than in two narrow vegetation zones between 4000–4350\n m and 2900–3300 m, no MFAs were found in 19 Kunlun Mountains soil samples from areas covered mainly with montane desert and\n alpine desert steppe vegetation. Based on the inventory of plants and soils from which MFAs have been isolated, we conclude\n that the MFAs most probably originate from specific woody plants. If we can exclude some particular grasses as sources, MFAs\n may be specific woody plants-derived biomarkers; thus they would serve as an important additional proxy for comprehensive\n and precise ecological reconstructions.",

        "title": "Altitudinal effect of soil <Emphasis Type=\"Italic\">n</Emphasis>-alkane <Emphasis Type=\"Italic\">δ</Emphasis>D values on the eastern Tibetan Plateau and their increasing isotopic fractionation with altitude",
        "abstract": "Stable isotope paleoaltimetry has provided unprecedented insights into the topographic histories of many of the world’s highest mountain ranges. However, on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), stable isotopes from paleosols generally yield much higher paleoaltitudes than those based on fossils. It is therefore essential when attempting to interpret accurately this region’s paleoaltitudes that the empirical calibrations of local stable isotopes and the relations between them are established. Additionally, it is vital that careful estimations be made when estimate how different isotopes sourced from different areas may have been influenced by different controls. We present here 29 hydrogen isotopic values for leaf wax-derived n-alkanes (i.e., δDwax values, and abundance-weighted average δD values of C29 and C31) in surface soils, as well as the δD values of soil water (δDsw) samples (totaling 22) from Mount Longmen (LM), on the eastern TP (altitude ~0.8–4.0 km above sea level (asl), a region climatically affected by the East Asian Monsoon (EAM). We compared our results with published data from Mount Gongga (GG). In addition, 47 river water samples, 55 spring water samples, and the daily and monthly summer precipitation records (from May to October, 2015) from two precipitation observation stations were collected along the GG transect for δD analysis. LM soil δDwax values showed regional differences and responded strongly to altitude, varying from‒160‰ to‒219‰, with an altitudinal lapse rate (ALR) of‒18‰ km‒1 (R 2=0.83; p<0.0001; n=29). These δDwax values appeared more enriched than those from the GG transect by ~40‰. We found that both the climate and moisture sources led to the differences observed in soil δDwax values between the LM and GG transects. We found that, as a general rule, ε wax/rw, ε wax/p and ε wax/sw values (i.e., the isotopic fractionation of δDwax corresponding to δDrw, δDp and δDsw) increased with increasing altitude along both the LM and GG transects (up to 34‰and 50‰, respectively). Basing its research on a comparative study of δDwax, δDp, δDrw(δDspringw) and δDsw, this paper discusses the effects of moisture recycling, glacier-fed meltwater, relative humidity (RH), evapotranspiration (ET), vegetation cover, latitude, topography and/or other factors on ε wax/p values. Clearly, if ε wax-p values at higher altitudes are calculated using smaller ε wax-p values from lower altitudes, the calculated paleowaterδDp values are going to be more depleted than the actual δD values, and any paleoaltitude would therefore be overestimated.",

The molecule of ENDP contains both acid source and gas source, which are the crucial components of the intumescent flame retardant (IFR). The synergistic effect of phosphor and nitrogen in ENDP imparts high efficiency to the flame retardant, and the existence of diphenylphosphate groups gives rise to the plastification. The effects of solvent, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst dosage on the ENDP yield were investigated. The optimum reaction conditions are as follows: tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent, at 45 °C for 8 h, the mass ratio of DMAP to DPCP is around 3%, and the yield of ENDP can reach up to 88.0%. The structure of ENDP was characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR and MS. The thermal analysis of ENDP indicates that the product possesses high thermal stability. The onset decomposition temperature and maximum decomposition temperature are 265 °C and 365 °C, respectively, and the char residue at 450 °C still remains 20%.",

In this context, two quantitative methods were introduced to reconstruct the uplift and denudation processes of orogenic belts. The former is a thermochronology method to identify provenances of sediments in a basin and reconstruct the evolution of uplift, denudation and thermal history of the adjacent related orogenic belts through detrital zircon and apatite fission-track dating. The premise conditions are well-controlled stratigraphy ages and sediments without  suffering thermal modification since they deposited. The latter is a mass-balance method, supposing that erosion and denudation accumulation mass of provenance paleotopography in orogenic belts is in direct proportion to the detrital sediment mass of the related basin under a certain period in a closed basin-range sedimentary coupling system. Studies on total mass of sediments, and deposition rate of sedimentary basin are effective methods to quantitatively recover the paleotopography and furthermore to reconstruct the evolution of orogenic belts. However, the area boundaries of basin-range system and the precision of stratigraphy chronology have a great effect on this recovery and reconstruction.",

        "title": "HIRM variations in the Chinese red-clay sequence: Insights into pedogenesis in the dust source area",
        "abstract": "Although extensive rock magnetic studies have been performed on the Chinese loess–paleosol sediments, few comparable studies have been applied to the underlying red-clay sediments. Because of this paucity of data, our understanding of the mineral magnetic properties of the red-clay sequence, and the paleoenvironmental information encoded in them, is limited. Here we report “hard” isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM) variations from ∼8.1 to ∼1.2 Ma in the lower part of the loess–paleosol and the underlying red-clay sequences of the Chaona section on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results indicate that there is a negative correlation between HIRM and frequency dependence of magnetic susceptibility χ fd ( χ fd = χ lf − χ hf , where χ lf and χ hf are magnetic susceptibility measured at 470 Hz and 4700 Hz, respectively) from ∼3.4 to ∼2.6 Ma and a positive correlation between these two proxies from ∼8.1 to ∼3.4 Ma and ∼2.6 to ∼1.2 Ma. We argue that the HIRM variations from ∼8.1 to ∼3.4 Ma and from ∼2.6 to ∼1.2 Ma reflect hematite availability in the dust source region, determined by the size of the area and climatic conditions of the dust source region. The negative correlation between HIRM and χ fd between ∼3.4 and ∼2.6 Ma suggests that magnetic enhancement during this time interval may be related to the alteration of hematite/goethite to magnetite/maghemite. We also find that HIRM data between 8.1 and 3.4 Ma show high coherence with the 100-kyr eccentricity signals, suggesting eccentricity forcing of concentration variations of hematite in the dust source area. Higher resolution samples are needed to determine if concentration variations of hematite in the dust source area are coherent with the orbital obliquity and precession forcing signals. Keywords Pliocene Monsoon Red-clay Loess Rock magnetism Hematite 1 Introduction A more complete picture of Cenozoic climate change and its driving mechanisms can only be obtained by an integrated analysis of widely distributed paleoclimate records. Recently a clearer picture of Cenozoic climatic history has appeared thanks to the work of Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) scientists ( Zachos et al., 2001 ). We now know that our climate system experienced a cooling trend starting from 55 million years ago (hereafter Ma) as well as many dramatic cooling events ( Zachos et al., 2001 ), i.e. the Oligocene-1 Glaciation around 34 Ma, the Miocene-1 Glaciation around 24 Ma, the intensification of the east Antarctic ice sheet around 14 Ma, and the onset of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation around 3 Ma, before it reached a condition with major Northern Hemisphere glaciations occurring every 100–40 kyr. However, the driving mechanisms of both the overall cooling trend and these cooling events are poorly understood. This fact, therefore, calls for more effort from paleoclimatists working on long and continuous continental sediment record. In particular the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is one of the strong candidates for the Cenozoic cooling trend and the onset of the glaciation by increasing chemical weathering and changing the atmospheric circulation patterns ( Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992; Rea et al., 1998 ). The aeolion dust sediment (i.e. loess) sequence on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) is one of the best continental archives of paleoclimate change for the Late Cenozoic era ( Heller and Liu, 1982; Liu, 1985 ). The sediment sequence on the CLP consists of two units: the loess/paleosol unit and the underlying red-clay unit. The loess/paleosol unit is deposited during the last 2.6 Ma, whereas the red-clay unit is deposited between ∼8 and 2.6 Ma. Previous rock magnetic studies have generally focused on the loess/paleosol unit and only a few papers have explored the magnetic characteristics of the Chinese red-clay sediments on the CLP ( Hao et al., 2008a; Liu et al., 2003 ). Recent studies have begun to explore the magnetic enhancement mechanisms of the red-clay unit and find that there is no major difference between the red-clay unit and the overlying loess/paleosol unit ( Nie et al., 2007, 2008d ). This finding has improved our understanding of the sea–land–cryosphere coupling relationship prior to the onset of the intensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation ( Nie et al., 2008a,b,c,d,e ). However, few studies ( Hao et al., 2008a,b ) explore the concentration variations of hematite, the mineral responsible for the red color of soils, in the red-clay unit. Such knowledge is necessary to gain a better understanding of the magnetic mineral transformation processes during pedogenesis on the CLP and its dust source area. It has been suggested that the comparison between the concentration of hematite and that of magnetite/maghemite will provide insights into the origin of the hematite grains and the magnetic enhancement pathway ( Liu et al., 2008; Torrent et al., 2006 ). Here we report an environmental magnetic study of the lower part of the loess–paleosol and the underlying red-clay sediments from the Chaona section. In this study, we focus on variations in several magnetic parameters: (1) the saturation isothermal remanent magnetization imparted at 1.2 Tesla (T) (SIRM); (2) the back-field isothermal remanent magnetization imparted at −0.3 T (BIRM), which is the part of the SIRM that reverses direction after application a field of −0.3 T; and (3) the “hard” isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM, defined as (SIRM+BIRM)/2, a concentration proxy ( King and Channell, 1991; Sangode and Bloemendal, 2004; Thompson and Oldfield, 1986 ) for high-coercivity minerals, especially hematite, to examine the temporal variation of hematite concentration with respect to other magnetic minerals. We compare these parameters to χ fd , a proxy for the concentration of ultrafine magnetic materials (primarily maghemite) produced during pedogenesis ( Liu et al., 2004; Nie et al., 2007 ), to determine the possible origin of the hematite grains. 2 Area descriptions and methods Powder samples were collected from the Chaona section (35°6′N, 107°12′E) using a sampling interval of 10–20 cm ( Fig. 1 ). The Chaona section lies at the Zhengjiashizi village, 5 km south of Chaona town in Lingtai County, at the foot of the eastern Liupan Mountains. The entire section is about 300 m in thickness with the upper 175 m comprising the loess–paleosol sequence and the underlying 125 m comprising the red-clay sequence. The loess–paleosol sequence consists of 32 paleosol and 33 loess units. An age model for the Chaona section has been established ( Lü et al., 2001 ) and it is based on an astronomical tuning of paleosols S1 through S32 for the loess–paleosol section ( Heslop et al., 2000 ) and paleomagnetic reversal ages ( Cande and Kent, 1995 ) for the red-clay sequence. The present study is mainly concerned with the mineral magnetic properties of the lower part of the loess–paleosol sequence and the red-clay sequence. For this study, ∼1000 samples (8–10 g) were taken every 20 cm from 90–300 m depth in the section. Remanence measurements (SIRM and BIRM) were made on the same samples previously measured for χ lf , χ hf , and χ ARM . The SIRM and BIRM were imparted in a constant field of 1.2 T and −0.3 T, respectively, and measured using a 2G Enterprises Model 755-R small-access cryogenic magnetometer. Following these measurement, HIRM values were calculated. All measurements were conducted in the Paleomagnetism Laboratory at the Graduate School of Oceanography of the University of Rhode Island. It has been shown that the HIRM method can produce higher random and systematic errors when the difference between SIRM and BIRM is small ( Liu et al., 2002 ). This error occurs because the HIRM method mathematically cancels out the anti-ferromagnetic background by subtracting the remanences imparted by two antiparrallel saturating fields. However, the background effects for each individual measurement (i.e. errors due to misalignment and viscosity) still exist and contribute to the measurement ( Liu et al., 2002 ). Therefore, any negative HIRM values (less than 0.5% of the total samples) in our data, which indicate that higher systematic errors exist and thus the differences between SIRM and BIRM are small, are set to zero to avoid confusion. Auto-spectra were generated using the REDFIT software package ( Schulz and Mudelsee, 2002 ) and cross-spectra were generated using the SPECTRUM software package ( Schulz and Stattegger, 1997 ). These two software packages are based on Lomb–Scargle Fourier transform in combination with the Welch-Overlapped-Segment-Averaging procedure, which do not require evenly-spaced temporal sampling and thus avoid enhancement of the low frequency components at the expense of high-frequency components ( Schulz and Mudelsee, 2002 ). Mössbauer spectra were measured at 4.2 K and room temperature. The measurements were performed with a conventional constant-acceleration spectrometer in transmission geometry with a source of 57 Co in an Rh matrix. Hyperfine parameters such as magnetic hyperfine field ( B HF ), isomer shift ( IS ) and quadrupole splitting ( QS ) have been determined by the NORMOS program ( Brand, 1987 ), and α-Fe at room temperature was used to calibrate isomer shifts and velocity scale. 3 Results The SIRM and BIRM data show similar fluctuation patterns to that of the χ fd with the highest values occurring around 2.75 Ma, whereas the HIRM data differs markedly ( Fig. 2 ). The HIRM shows little variability in the red-clay sequence with one exception from ∼2.79 to ∼2.71 Ma ( Fig. 2 ). During that time interval the values approach or are equal to zero. In contrast, corresponding χ fd values during this interval are the highest observed for the entire study interval (1.2–8.1 Ma) ( Fig. 2 ). The variability of the HIRM data increases dramatically in the loess–paleosol sequence, however, this increase is primarily caused by a dramatic increase in HIRM values in the paleosol layers, which correspond to higher χ fd values. The HIRM values observed in loess layers stay approximately the same as in the majority of the red-clay sequence ( Fig. 2 ). Figs. 3–5 are blown-up versions of Fig. 2 from ∼3.4 to ∼2.6 Ma, from ∼ 8.1 to ∼ 3.4 Ma, and from ∼2.6 to ∼1.2 Ma, respectively. A negative relationship between HIRM and the other magnetic parameters is observed from ∼3.4 to ∼2.6 Ma ( Fig. 3 ). The negative correlation between HIRM and χ fd from ∼3.4 to ∼2.6 Ma is more obvious in Fig. 6 . Figs. 4 and 5 show a positive correlation between HIRM and the other three parameters from ∼ 8.1 to ∼ 3.4 Ma and from ∼2.6 to ∼1.2 Ma. However, the variations of HIRM are significantly dampened in the interval from ∼8.1 to 3.4 Ma compared to the overlying loess–paleosol sequence (∼2.6–1.2 Ma) ( Fig. 2 ). These positive correlations are more obvious in Fig. 6 . The spectra characteristics between HIRM and June 21 insolation at 35°N ( Laskar, 1990 ) are compared in Fig. 7 . The autospectrum estimate of the HIRM time series between 8.1 and 3.4 Ma shows that the 20-kyr, 40-kyr, 100-kyr, 400-kyr, and 1-Myr signals are significant above the 80% significance level ( Fig. 7 a). The 20-kyr signal is significant above the 90% significance level, while the other orbital signals are just below the 90% significance level. In addition, a ∼70-kyr signal, which has no corresponding orbital periodicity ( Fig. 7 b) but has often been reported in loess studies, is observed and is significant at the 90% significance level ( Lu et al., 2004 ). The 1-Myr signal is significant at the 90% level but does not have a corresponding periodicity in the insolation spectra ( Fig. 7 b), which merits further studies. The 20-kyr and 40-kyr HIRM signals are coherent with insolation at the 80% significance level, and the 100-kyr signals are coherent with eccentricity at the 95% significance level, suggesting that, on these timescales, HIRM is forced by insolation ( Fig. 7 c). The large sample interval (20 cm, corresponding to a time interval of ∼9 kyr) is likely the reason for the observed weaker 20-kyr and 40-kyr band signals in the HIRM records and the lower coherence between HIRM and insolation at the 20-kyr and 40-kyr bands. Mössbauer spectra ( Table 1 ) measured at room temperature for the red-clay samples from the Chaona section only detect the presence of a sextet corresponding to hematite with magnetic order and doublets of Fe 3+ and Fe 2+ , a paramagnetic-like behavior. At 4.2 K, the doublets of Fe 3+ and Fe 2+ (representing iron silicates) and a sextet (related to goethite) were fitted, corresponding to ∼18 wt.% (of the total iron) for one red-clay sample (sample CN4940 corresponding to 4.73 Ma). This result indicates that goethite grains in the red-clay samples are within the superparamagnetic size and thus do not contribute to HIRM measured at room temperature ( Dyar et al., 2006 ). 4 Discussion 4.1 HIRM variations from 8.1 to 3.4 Ma and from 2.6 to 1.2 Ma and their paleoclimatic implications HIRM is generally used as a proxy for the concentration of the high coercivity magnetic minerals hematite and goethite but is a more sensitive indicator of hematite ( King and Channell, 1991; Sangode and Bloemendal, 2004; Thompson and Oldfield, 1986 ). The lower sensitivity for goethite is because goethite does not saturate until the imparted magnetic field is larger than 4 T, or even 7 T and thus (IRM 4 T + IRM −3 T )/2 has been used as a proxy for the concentration of goethite ( Sangode and Bloemendal, 2004 ), where IRM 4 T and IRM −3 T represent isothermal remanent magnetization imparted at 4 T and −3 T, respectively. A high correlation ( R 2 = 0.73) between the HIRM trend and the concentration of hematite from the L5 to L6 section at the Luochuan section on the Chinese Loess Plateau further confirmed the validity of HIRM as a proxy for the concentration of hematite especially at orbital timescales ( Liu et al., 2006 ). In addition, preliminary Mössbauer spectroscopy results did not detect goethite in the red-clay samples from the Chaona section ( Table 1 ) and paleosol samples from the Xi’an section ( Eyre and Dickson, 1995 ) at room temperature, but detected ∼18 wt.% (of the total iron) goethite for the Chaona red-clay samples at 4.2 K. This result indicates that goethite grains are mostly superparamagnetic and do not contribute to HIRM variations. A positive correlation between the concentration of pedogenic ferromagnetic minerals and hematite concentration in the Chinese loess–paleosol sequence has been reported ( Balsam et al., 2004 ). Our study confirms Balsam et al.’s finding. In addition, our results indicate that in the red-clay sequence, a positive correlation between the concentration of pedogenic ferrimagnets and hematite also exists. However, this positive correlation between the concentration of pedogenic ferrimagnetic minerals and hematite concentration can not be easily understood. It has been well established that a drier climate is a prerequisite for the production of hematite, but if so it seems anomalous for higher concentrations of hematite to occur in wetter interglacial periods corresponding to higher χ fd values. Torrent et al. (2006) have argued that this positive correlation between the concentration of pedogenic ferromagnetic minerals and hematite concentrations indicates that magnetic enhancement follows a different formation pathway, i.e. the ferrihydrite → maghemite → hematite route. However, the direct transition of ferrihydrite to maghemite has never been observed in natural soils ( Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003 ). We argue that the higher concentration of hematite must have come from the dust source region of the CLP, presumably the nearby Gobi deserts, rather than in situ production via pedogenic processes. Even in interglacial periods like today, the Gobi desert region is still an extremely arid area because the East Asian summer monsoon does not influence the area and moisture from the Indian summer monsoon is blocked by the Tibetan Plateau. Higher temperatures and drier climate will promote hematite formation, probably due to the dehydration of ferrihydrates ( Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003 ). The hematite in the Gobi deserts can be easily transported to the CLP via dust storms during winter and spring, thus causing a higher concentration of hematite in soils developed during interglacial periods. In comparison, the colder and drier climate during glacial periods will prevent production of hematite via dehydration of ferrihydrates in the Gobi desert region. Therefore, in glacial periods, we observed less hematite from loess layers on the CLP. This explanation is consistent with two independent lines of evidence: (1) The Luochuan section, which is closer to the source region, has a higher hematite content compared with the Lingtai section, which is farther from the source region ( Balsam et al., 2004 ) ( Fig. 1 ); (2) HIRM is a measure of the concentration of hematite grains with stable remanent magnetization, including larger single-domain, pseudo-single-domain, and multi-domain. In situ pedogeneis on the CLP tends to produce superparamegnetic and smaller single-domain magnetic grains ( Liu et al., 2007a; Nie et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 1990 ), whereas aeolion inputs to the CLP from the source regions include larger grain sizes ( Liu et al., 2007a ). Future studies, like those conducting magnetic measurements on a particle-size specific basis ( Hao et al., 2008b ), will be able to test our hypothesis. Compared with the loess–paleosol sequence, the concentration variations of hematite in the red-clay sequence are significantly dampened ( Fig. 2 ). However, the decreased variability in hematite concentration in the red-clay sequence is readily understandable. The North Pacific dust flux record shows that the dust source area in central Asia is much smaller during the time interval 8.1–∼3.6 Ma compared to ∼2.6–0 Ma ( Rea et al., 1998 ). The bigger dust source area in the last 2.6 Ma can be explained by climate cooling in the Asian interior during the Plio-Pleistocene, which is most likely controlled by intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation ( Raymo, 1994 ) and progressive uplift of the Tibetan Plateau beginning ∼3.6 Ma ( An et al., 2001; Fang et al., 1997; Fang et al., 2005, 2007; Li et al., 1997; Tapponnier et al., 2001 ). Hematite content variations are dampened from 8.1 to 3.4 Ma because the availability of hematite grains is significantly lower in the source region from 8.1 to 3.4 Ma. The y -axis intercepts in Figs. 6 a and b indicate averaged hematite contents in the dust source regions during glacial periods with less hematite production via dehydration of ferrihydrates. The higher intercept value (0.487 * 10 −3 Am 2 kg −1 ) in the lower part of the red-clay sequence indicates that the dust source region is more enriched in hematite during the interval of red-clay formation than during the interval of loess–paleosol formation. This observation is consistent with higher global temperature from 8.1 to 3.4 Ma as inferred from benthic oxygen isotope data ( Zachos et al., 2001 ). It is worth noting that several studies have suggested that poor soil drainage (or waterlogging) ( Ding et al., 2001; Guo et al., 2001 ) has affected their red-clay sections and thus it is possible that gleying may have affected the magnetic properties of part of the red-clay section. However, other studies ( An et al., 2001 ) found a good correlation between magnetic susceptibility and Rb/Sr, a chemical weathering proxy not sensitive to gleying, from their red-clay section, suggesting that gleying did not affect the magnetic properties of their red-clay section. Therefore, it seems that the occurrence of gleying in the red-clay sections on the CLP is site-dependent. The red-clay section that we study here was obviously not affected by waterlogging because: (1) we did not find apparent sedimentologic evidence of gleying from our studied section and (2) detailed rock magnetic studies from the same section show consistent grain size of pedogenically-produced ferromagnetic grains throughout the section ( Nie et al., 2007, 2008d ). If gleying had occurred periodically, fine-grained ferrimagnetic minerals would have preferentially been destroyed due to the reducing conditions associated with soil gleying ( Liu et al., 2001 ). 4.2 HIRM variations from 3.4 to 2.6 Ma and their paleoclimatic implications Workers have speculated ( Bloemendal and Liu, 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Maher, 1998 ) that, in the presence of iron-reducing bacteria and organic matter, “hard” or weakly magnetic minerals can be changed to “soft” strongly magnetic ferrimagnetic minerals via inorganic iron redox processes and thus magnetic enhancement would occur. However, corresponding supporting evidence is lacking ( Torrent et al., 2006 ). The negative correlation between HIRM and χ fd ( Figs. 3 and 6c ) strongly suggests that magnetic enhancement during this time interval is related to the alteration of hematite and thus supports the previously noted magnetic enhancement route. This negative correlation does not contradict our explanation that hematite grains on the CLP primarily come from the dust source region. During the time interval ∼3.4–∼2.6 Ma, we speculate that many bigger hematite grains coming from the dust source region have been partially or completely altered to either magnetite/maghemite, or smaller (probably superparamagnetic) hematite without a remanent magnetization. This time interval would be characterized by intermittently reducing soil conditions. These conditions would result from periods of intensified precipitation, likely coming from an intensified summer monsoon caused by the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau ( An et al., 2001; Fang et al., 1997, 2005, 2007; Li et al., 1997; Nie et al., 2008a,c,d; Tapponnier et al., 2001 ). 4.3 HIRM higher frequency variations before 3.4 Ma The 20-kyr, and 40-kyr HIRM signals are coherent with insolation at the 80% significance level, and the 100-kyr signals are coherent with eccentricity at the 95% significance level, suggesting that, on these timescales, HIRM is forced by insolation. The large sample interval (20 cm, corresponding to a time interval of ∼9 kyr) is likely the major reason for the observed weaker 20-kyr and 40-kyr band signals in the HIRM records and the lower coherence between HIRM and insolation at the 20-kyr and 40-kyr bands. 5 Conclusions 1. HIRM and χ fd in the study section have a positive correlation during the intervals ∼8.1–∼3.4 Ma and ∼2.6–∼1.2 Ma. We argue that the hematite concentration variations during these intervals reflect hematite availability in the dust source region, determined by the area and climatic conditions of the dust source region. 2. HIRM and χ fd in the Chaona section have a negative correlation during the intervals ∼3.4–∼2.6 Ma. The negative correlation suggests that magnetic enhancement during this time interval may be related to the alteration of hematite/goethite to magnetite/maghemite. This alteration would support the hypothesis that in the existence of iron-reducing bacteria and organic matter, “hard” or weakly magnetic minerals can be changed to “soft” ferrimagnetic minerals via inorganic iron redox processes and thus cause magnetic enhancement. We speculate that many larger hematite grains coming from the dust source region have been altered either completely or partially and changed into magnetite/maghemite or smaller (probably superparamagnetic) hematite without a remanent magnetization. This time interval would be characterized by relatively intermittent reducing soil conditions, probably caused by a period of intensified East Asian summer monsoon precipitation associated with the Pliocene northeastern uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. 6 Future work We propose that future work should test our hypothesis from two aspects: (1) Future studies should conduct magnetic measurements on a particle-size specific basis ( Hao et al., 2008b ) to figure out the exact grain size of the minerals represented by the HIRM record. (2) A recent study ( Liu et al., 2007b ) found that synthetic Al-substituted hematite and goethite exhibit a wide range of coercivities, which might influence the validity of HIRM as a proxy for concentration of hematite. These authors also found that HIRM reflects changes in the absolute concentration of hematite and/or goethite only if the L-ratio (defined as the ratio of two remanences after alternating field (AF) demagnetization of an IRM imparted in a 1 T field with a peak AF of 100 mT and 300 mT) is relatively constant. Another study ( Maher et al., 2004 ) suggests that AF demagnetization of HIRM with a peak AF field of 100 mT will effectively remove contribution of ferromagnetic grains to HIRM. Future studies should test our conclusions following these techniques. Acknowledgements We thank L. Lü for providing age-depth model of the Chaona section. We thank S. Yang, K. Fu, F. Wu, X. Chen, M.

        "abstract": "A rare lacustrine rhythmite from the Qiulinanmu Playa Lake in Tibet is presented, which was composed of distinct layers of mirabilite, borax, and clay with thickness measuring 1.5-75 cm, 0.5-20 mm, and 0.5-30 mm, respectively. The thickness of each layer was measured in the field and dating was performed using 14C and U data. The lake was previously supplied by river water, groundwater, and hot springs enriched in sodium, sulfur, and boron. Control factors on the rhythmite were climate oscillations and compositional differences of water. The adsorption of boron by clay minerals could be attributed to the alternation between clay and borax layers. Low temperature, high pH, and high evaporation exerted significant influences on the precipitation of original borax and mirabilite. In the evaporative lake, the precipitation of mirabilite (a mineral indicative of a cold-dry environment) was dominant and produced the asymmetric couplets. The lake water was poor in chloride and rich in sodium sulfate, and an abrupt change was observed at 11.4 cal. kyr bp. According to the laminated sediment and the thickness of the minerals, the climate was dry-cold with four sub-warm phases before 11.4 kyr bp (after 20.6-11.4 kyr bp), and wet-warm with four sub-cold pulses after 11.4 kyr bp (11.4-5.2 kyr bp). The two thickest mirabilite layers suggested extremely hard conditions after 20.6 kyr bp, and before 11.4 kyr bp, respectively. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

Their age was based on 40Ar/39Ar dating of biotites and U–Pb dating of zircons from layers within the Xiyu Formation, which they interpreted as “volcanic ash.” This chronology effectively extends the formation of the Taklimakan Desert from ∼5 Ma, as recently reported from outcrop (2) and high-resolution borehole data (3), to 27 Ma (1). After publication of this article, a field investigation was organized with its two leading authors (Hongbo Zheng and Xiaochun Wei) and 26 other geologists to more closely scrutinize the stratigraphy of the Xiyu Formation. Our new field and laboratory investigations do not support the existence …",

These extracts contain pseudohomologous families of 5,5-diethylalkanes (5,5-DEAs), 6,6-diethylalkanes,\n 5-butyl-5-ethylalkanes and 6-butyl-6-ethylalkanes, which are first detected in modern soils. All these pseudohomologous series\n display exclusively odd or exclusively even carbon numbers, clearly indicating a biosynthetic origin, and their carbon number\n distributions generally covary. The distributions of 5,5-DEAs exhibit strong regional variations, correlated with the spatial\n distributions of climate and vegetation. The lower molecular weight 5,5-DEAs, maximizing at C21 or C23, dominate in southeast and southwest China samples, while the higher molecular weight 5,5-DEAs with a mode at C29 dominate in cold, arid northwest China and Mongolia. The results demonstrate that the distribution of 5,5-DEAs can serve\n as a new independent proxy, indicating variations in soil ecosystems and climates, just like the well-known proxy of n-C15–21/n-C22–33 ratios.",

        "abstract": "The Xining Basin lies in the transitional zone between the arid Asian interior and the East Asian monsoon region. The continuous Cenozoic sediments in the basin provide a unique archive recording the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and its environmental effects on central Asian aridification and Asian monsoon evolution. However, sediments deposited since the middle Middle Miocene have not been precisely dated, hindering our ability to address these issues. Here, we dated a 336-m-thick section containing many Late Miocene fossil mammals from the eastern basin. High-resolution paleomagnetism revealed 16 normal and 16 reversed zones that correlate well with chrons 3n to 5Ar.1r of the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale, constraining the section to ∼12.7-4.8 Ma. The changes in lithofacies from floodplain to braided river at ∼8.6 Ma and to thick alluvial fan at ∼6.3 Ma with predominantly southerly paleocurrent directions occur simultaneously with an increase in the sedimentation rates, representing two periods of rapid uplift in the eastern Qilian Shan to the north. Our results provide a robust oldest age constraint (u003c4.8 Ma) on the ancient Huang Shui and Yellow River terraces on the basin sediments and eolian deposits on the terraces. The presence of well-developed floodplain paleosols, shallow lake marls and many large mammals in the lower section suggests that the monsoon climate in the late Middle Miocene to Late Miocene was more humid and stronger than that at present.",

(2016) did not provide details of their modeling inputs, and, in particular, the parameters they chose for their calculations, where such parameters can have a serious impact upon any results. We therefore performed calculations using the same software (i.e., Qupydon) as Qiao et al. (2016), using reliable parameter settings. The results showed that the interesting  of a 6000 minimum cost output completely correlate with the magnetostratigraphic Chrons C18r to C3An.1n (similar to 40-6 Ma), which is consistent with our reinterpreted magnetostratigraphic results. Furthermore, we summarized previous biostratigraphic studies of nearby areas; the data resulting from this process also supported our reinterpreted magnetostratigraphic correlation. We were therefore able to confirm the revised magnetostratigraphic correlation of Zhang et al. (2014). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The Linxia Basin, located on the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is a compressional flexural foreland basin. At the boundary of the basin, the fold and thrust fault zone has expanded towards to the interior of the basin from west to east since 7.78 Ma, while growth strata and growth unconformities formed, reflecting a continuous process of tectonic deformation on the northeast edge of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This kind of tectonic deformation accompanying deposition persisted until the complete deposition of the Dongshan Formation at about 1.8 Ma. The strong folding of the strata includes the Dongshan Formation and lower older units in the Linxia Basin. The Dongshan Formation and the upper, oldest terrace of Yellow River, the Jinggou Formation of conglomerate, form an angular unconformity. Therefore, the Lajishan Mountain expanded continuously to the NE until the Yinchuan anticline formed. Then a new stage in the development of the Yellow River and Daxia River appeared, river terraces developed, and aeolian loess was deposited. The total crustal shortening is about 3.2-3.6 km on the western margin of the Linxia Basin since 7.8 Ma; thus, the average shortening rate has been about 0.41-0.46 mm/a calculated from the balanced cross-section. If we select a 6.0 Myr period between 7.8 Ma and 1.8 Ma as the period of tectonic deformation, then the shortening rate is about 0.5-0.6 mm/a. Both the style of development and the evolution of the Linxia Basin suggest that the tectonic deformation on the northeast margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is characterized by thrusting and crustal shortening with a WNW orientation. Such tectonic deformation led to the following evolution: the foreland basin gradually rose and sedimentation stopped, then most of the Cenozoic foreland basin merged into the northeast margin and became the newest part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

        "abstract": "The Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) defines the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau; therefore, its tectonic history is key to understanding the plateau’s northward growth. However, our understanding of ATF tectonics is incomplete, owing in part to a lack of constraints in detailed basin evolution studies of this region. Approximately 1700 m of Middle Miocene – Pliocene clastic strata extracted from a section of the Yitunbulake Basin adjacent to the midsection of the ATF records the uplift of the Altyn Tagh Range. This paper reports 490 concordant detrital zircon U–Pb ages derived from this set of strata. In addition, paleocurrents and conglomerate clastic compositions were measured to determine the provenance of the basin. The dominant detrital zircon age populations within these sedimentary rocks are 260–240, 500–400, and 950–900 Ma. The 260–240 Ma component decreases sharply above the Lower (Xia) Youshashan (XYSS) Formation. Moreover, we performed (U–Th)/He dating on 260–240 Ma detrital zircons from the XYSS...",

        "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) in lake sediments reacts strongly to changes of redox conditions. This study analyzed Mn concentrations in oxides, carbonates, and bulk phases of the calcareous lacustrine sediments of a 938.5-m-long core (SG-1) taken from the western Qaidam Basin, well dated from 2.77Ma to 0.1Ma. Comparisons of extractions from diluted hydrochloric acid, acetic acid and citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite demonstrate that variations of Mn concentrations from acetic acid leaching (MnHOAc) are mostly responsible for Mn (II) fluctuations in the carbonate phase. Taking into account the relevant processes during weathering, transportation, deposition and post-deposition of Mn-bearing rocks, we conclude that Mn input from catchment weathering and paleolake redox condition provide the primary controls on variations in the Mn records of carbonate and oxide phases. We propose MnHOAc as a new sensitive indicator of paleolake redox evolution and catchment-scale climate change. The MnHOAc variations show a long-term upward decreasing trend, indicating a long-term decrease of Mn input from catchment weathering associated with increasing oxygen content in the paleolake bottom water. The great similarities of the MnHOAc record with other regional and global records suggest that paleolake redox changes and climatic drying in the Qaidam Basin may be largely related to global cooling. © 2013 University of Washington.",

        "abstract": "A series of important geological events occurred in the Tibetan Plateau area during the Jurassic, such as the collision of the Lhasa and Qiangtang Terranes, the closure of the Meso-Tethyan Ocean, the opening of the Neo-Tethyan Ocean and the cessation of the mega-monsoon. The similar to 3000 m thick Jurassic sedimentary sequence in the Qiangtang Basin on the central Tibetan Plateau, which is called the Yanshiping (YSP) Group, recorded these geological events. However, the chronology of the sequence is surprisingly poorly constrained. Here, we perform a detailed palaeomagnetic analysis on the similar to 1060 m thick middle and upper portions of the YSP Group (the Xiali and Suowa Formations) in the YSP section of the eastern Qiangtang Basin. Three bivalve zones at stratigraphic intervals of similar to 40-140, 640-800 and 940-1040 m are identified, which yield a Bathonian-Callovian age for the Lower Xiali Fm., a Callovian-Oxfordian age for the Lower Suowa Fm. and an Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian age for the Upper Suowa Fm. A total of 544 oriented palaeomagnetic samples were collected from the section. By combining thermal and alternating field demagnetizations, clear characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) directions are isolated for most of the samples. The robust ChRM directions pass fold and reversals tests, which support the primary nature of the ChRMs and yield a palaeopole at 76.8A degrees N/297.2A degrees E (dp = 2.2A degrees, dm = 3.7A degrees). A total of 27 normal and 26 reversed polarity zones were successfully recorded in the section. Combined with fossil age constraints, results suggest that the section is plausibly composed of a Callovian-Early Kimmeridgian age sedimentary sequence.",

        "abstract": "A high-resolution record of the Blake Event has been obtained from a 40 m well dug in a loess section at Jiuzhoutai in the City of Lanzhou in the western Loess Plateau of China. The paleomagnetic signal is principally carried by magnetite both in loess and paleosols. The Blake Event is located at the boundary between paleosol S1-c of the last interglacial (equivalent to MIS 5e in deep-sea records) and loess L2-2 (MIS 5d), and is characterized by a triple feature consisting of two short reversed intervals separated by a short normal interval. The directional changes are abrupt, as previously revealed in other records, and suggest geocentric dipole field behavior before, after and during the event, but not necessarily during N R or R N transitions. The age and duration of the event are estimated as between 119.97 and 114.47 kyr BP and 5.5 kyr, respectively, from thermoluminescence dating and astronomically tuned climate stratigraphy based on high-resolution magnetic susceptibility.

        "abstract": "Fluid inclusions trapped in ancient halite can contain a community of halophilic prokaryotes and eukaryotes that inhabited the surface brines from which the halite formed. Long-term survival of bacteria and archaea and preservation of DNA have been reported from halite, but little is known about the distribution of microbes in buried evaporites. Here we report the discovery of prokaryotes and single-celled algae in fluid inclusions in Pleistocene halite, up to 2.26 Ma in age, from the Qaidam Basin, China. We show that water activity (aw), a measure of water availability and an environmental control on biological habitability in surface brines, is also related to microbe entrapment in fluid inclusions. The aw of Qaidam Basin brines progressively decreased over the last ∼1 million years, driven by aridification of the Asian interior, which led to decreased precipitation and water inflow and heightened evaporation rates. These changes in water balance produced highly concentrated brines, which reduced the habitability of surface lakes and decreased the number of microbes trapped in halite. By 0.13 Ma, the aw of surface brines approached the limits tolerated by halophilic prokaryotes and algae. These results show the response of microbial ecosystems to climate change in an extreme environment, which will guide future studies exploring deep life on Earth and elsewhere in the Solar System.

        "title": "Tectonosedimentary evolution model of an intracontinental flexural (foreland) basin for paleoclimatic research",
        "abstract": "Intracontinental flexural (foreland) basin sediments are now frequently used as archives for detailed paleoclimatic and sedimentary environmental reconstruction, fossil and stratigraphic correlation, and tectonic evolution and uplift of basin and orogen. However, sedimentologic characteristics vary considerably in time-space with the evolution of flexural basin, apt to cause misinterpretation of climatic change and stratigraphic correlation. Based on high resolution fossil mammal and magnetostratigraphic constraints and sedimentary facies analysis, here we took the Linxia Basin at the front of the NE Tibetan Plateau as a case to demonstrate and figure out a model how sedimentology and stratigraphy vary temporospatially with the evolution of such flexural basin. The results show that the Linxia Basin is a type intracontinental foreland basin subjected to two phases of flexural deformation exerted by the West Qin Ling (Mts.) and NE Tibetan Plateau to the south. Phase I began latest at the beginning of the Miocene (233 Ma), indicated by a balanced fast flexural subsidence and mostly fine sediment infilling giving rise to the early underlying unconformity. It manifests as an obvious sediment wedge with high filling rate, thickening toward mountains and an occurrence of a mountains-parallel big river - shallow lake system along the foredeep, suggesting a less high mountain topography. In the late Phase I, from similar to 13 Ma to 8 Ma, the subsidence and thickening rates began to decrease, accompanied by faults and deformation propagating gradually into the basin, causing gradual basinward migration of the foredeep and its accompanying river-lake system. Since similar to 8 Ma in Phase II, the West Qin Ling and NE Tibetan began to uplift rapidly and thrust/load onto the Linxia Basin, causing strong mountain erosion, thrust-fold belt propagation and basin overfilling. This forced the mountains-parallel river - lake system to turn to the mountains-perpendicular alluvial - braided river system, and finally to an outflow system by the Quaternary onset of the Yellow River in the basin. Concurrent are rapid rotation of the basin, occurrence of growth strata and late unconformities, widespread expansion of boulder conglomerates, great decreasing and increasing sedimentation rates above and before the hanging wall of the fault-fold system and new supplementary provenance from the thrust-fold system. This demonstrates that in stable climate, same lithologic units such as distinct lacustrine sediments and alluvial conglomerates will migrate basinwards with the foredeep moving into basin, causing a great diachroneity and often misleads to recognize the same lithologic unit in space as one unit in time. A dynamic model is presented that should help to avoid such pitfalls in tectonic basin evolution, especially concerning stratigraphic correlation and paleoclimatic change research.

        "abstract": "Drying of the Asian interior has generally been linked to Tibetan Plateau uplift, retreat of the Para-Tethys Sea and global cooling. However, lack of detailed aridification records hinders elucidation of how drying is controlled by these factors and to what extent each factor contributes. In this study, a 600. m deep core (SG-3) of lacustrine-playa deposits was obtained from the western Qaidam Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau for pollen analysis. Magnetostratigraphic dating of the core determines its age at ca. 3.1-0.01. Ma. The palynologic compositions show that a steppe to desert vegetation predominates the core. Artemisia-dominated steppe representative of relative warm and wet climate before 2.6. Ma changed to Chenopodiaceae-dominated steppe desert under drier climate conditions between 2.6. Ma and 0.9. Ma, interrupted by a short moister interval of Artemisia-dominated steppe at 1.8-1.2. Ma. From 0.9. Ma to 0.6. Ma, Chenopodiaceae-Ephedraceae desert vegetation started to develop, and since 0.6. Ma, Ephedraceae-dominated desert prevailed. This vegetation change in the western Qaidam Basin suggests a stepwise long-term aridification of the central Asia inland beginning at ca. 2.6. Ma, 1.2. Ma, 0.9. Ma and 0.6. Ma since the late Pliocene, most probably as a response to both long-term global cooling and Tibetan Plateau uplift at those times. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The Qiangtang Basin (QB), located in the central Tibetan Plateau, is a Jurassic marine basin and one of the most important prospective salt resource belts in China. In recent decades, many outcrops of gypsiferous bed have been found in the Jurassic marine strata in the basin. Salt springs with abnormally high sodium (Na+) contents had been identified in the Late Jurassic Xiali Formation (Fm.) in the basin in the last years. However, to date, no potash or halite deposits have been identified in the QB. Gypsum outcrops and salt springs are very important signs in the investigation of halite and potash deposits. Therefore, the Xiali Fm. is a potentially valuable layer to evaluate for the possible presence of halite and potash deposits in the basin. However, few studies have explored the formation conditions of evaporites in the unit. Here, we present detailed geochemical records from the Yanshiping section related to the study of the formation conditions of evaporites in the Xiali Fm. of the QB. Climate proxies based on the obviously increased anion concentrations of SO42- and Cl- and the significant correlation coefficients of Ca2+-SO42- (R = 0.985) and Na+-Cl- (R = 0.8974) reveal that the upper member of the Xiali Fm. (the upper Xiali Fm.) formed under an arid climate and evolved into the sulfate phase or early chloride phase. Provenance proxies based on the obviously increased K+ and Na+ ion concentrations and the significant correlation coefficient of Na+-Cl- (R = 0.8974) suggest that the upper Xiali Fm. featured optimal provenance conditions for the possible formation of halite deposits. The regression and the semi-closed tidal flat environment in the upper Xiali Fm. were favorable for the formation of potash and halite deposits. The low Mg2+ /Ca2+ values (mean value = 1.82) and significant Na+-Cl- correlation coefficient (R = 0.8974) also suggest that the upper Xiali Fm. is the layer most likely to contain potential halite deposits. In addition, the macroscopic correlations of tectonism, provenance, paleoclimate, saliferous strata and sedimentary environment between the QB and the adjoining Amu Darya Basin in Central Asia reveal that the two basins shared similar geologic settings that were favorable for the formation of evaporites during the Late Jurassic. Therefore, the upper Xiali Fm. is a valuable layer to explore for halite deposit and may be potentially valuable in the future exploration for potash deposits in the QB.",

        "abstract": "To ascertain whether the long form leptin receptor (LEPR) affects the regulation of embryo attachment and whether there are LEPR Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with reproductive traits in pigs, Real-time qPCR was used to detect relative abundance of LEPR mRNA pattern in different tissues of Suzhong sows during the embryo attachment period (pregnancy day 13, 18 and 24) to the uterus, and PCR-RFLP as well as PCR-sequencing were used to investigate the coding sequence for SNPs of LEPR in a population of 512 Suzhong sows. Real-time qPCR results indicated that LEPR mRNA was present in all 22 tissues of pigs with differences in relative abundance of the LEPR mRNA (P<0.05). Among these tissues, the greatest relative abundance occurred at the endometrial attachment site (P<0.01), followed by the hypothalamus and most reproductive tissues (P<0.05), and there was a lesser relative abundance of the LEPR mRNA in the pituitary. During different embryo attachment periods, LEPR mRNA was greatest on Day 18 (attachment; P<0.05), followed by Day 24 (post-attachment), and relative abundance was least on Day 13 (pre-attachment). The prevalence of the LEPR mRNA in pregnant sows was greater than in non-pregnant sows (P<0.05). At the c.2856C>T locus of LEPR, Chi-square test results demonstrated that allele and genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium at this locus, PCR-RFLP results revealed that Genotype TT was greater than Genotype CC (P<0.05) for reproductive traits of TNB (Total Number Born) and NBA (Number Born Alive), which suggested that T allele at c.2856C>T locus has advantageous effects on litter size and litter weight in Suzhong pigs. In conclusion, the expression of the LEPR gene might be involved in the regulation of embryo attachment mechanisms in pigs, and the LEPR SNP c.2856C>T could be a molecular marker for improving litter size and litter weight in pig breeding.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic grain-size variations have been used as sensitive paleoclimate proxies to investigate the evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon, but their relationship with temperature and precipitation is not entirely clear. Here we find that two magnetic grain-size proxy records (χARM/χLF and χARM/SIRM, where χARM, χLF and SIRM are anhysteretic remanent magnetization susceptibility, magnetic susceptibility measured at 470Hz and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization, respectively) of Chinese loess and red-clay sediments co-vary during the last 6Ma, except between ~4.5 and 2.6Ma, when these two records had opposite trends. We attribute this disparate behavior to the different responses of χARM/χLF and χARM/SIRM to temperature and precipitation during ~4.5-2.6Ma, when temperature and precipitation on the Chinese Loess Plateau were decoupled. A comparison of the loess and red-clay χARM/χLF and χARM/SIRM records with the global ice-volume proxy records reveals that χARM/χLF is more sensitive to temperature variations than χARM/SIRM. The results suggest that temperature on the Chinese Loess Plateau had a cooling trend from ~4.5 to ~2.6Ma, whereas rainfall tended to increase. Our studies demonstrate that joint analysis of loess χARM/χLF and χARM/SIRM records can reveal paleoclimatic information that cannot be revealed by a single parameter. © 2013 University of Washington.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Little is known about the evolution of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) on the NE margin of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, due to the poor exposure of pre-Quaternary eolian deposits and ambiguities in the interpretation of paleoclimatic proxies. In this study, we performed detailed grain-size analyses of eolian sequences (spanning 3.7–2.4 Ma) from two new boreholes in Linxia Basin, in the NE TP. We compared our results with contemporaneous loess-red clay sequences across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) and identified a substantial decrease in the thickness and grain size of upper Pliocene-lower Pleistocene loess and red clay sediments from the western to central parts of the CLP. This observation supports the view that the grain size of upper Pliocene eolian sequences from Linxia Basin can be used to reconstruct the evolution of the EAWM. In addition, it demonstrates that the modern spatial pattern of the EAWM regime in the western CLP has been maintained since at least the late Pliocene. Records of both median grain-size (Md) and sand content from the boreholes exhibit an overall upward-increasing trend during the interval from ~3.7–2.4 Ma, indicating a long-term stepwise intensification of the EAWM and aridity on the NE margin of the TP. In addition, a dramatic coarsening of the grain size in loess unit L34 documents a large climatic shift at ~2.75 Ma, which may be closely linked with the major intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation during the late Pliocene.",

        "abstract": "The research on the Cretaceous tectonic uplift of the Qilian mountains is crucial in understanding the formation of the Tibetan plateau and its impact on the environment of Asia.The early Cretaceous nonmarine sediments of the Hekou group in the Minhe-Lanzhou basin(a subbasin of the Longzhong basin),north of the Tibetan plateau,have well documented the process of the tectonic uplift of the Qilian Mt.during the early Cretaceous.The Hekou group may be divided into eight segments and is composed of the conglomerates,gravel-bearing sandstones,sandstones,silts and mudstones with ca.4 000 meter in thickness.Seven sedimentary facies have been found,base on the analysis of sedimentary sequence from the bottom to the top,they are the alluvial fan facies,fan delta facies,braided fluvial facies,shore-lake facies,shore-shallow lake facies,semi-deep lake facies and delta facies.The analysis of the nature of sedimentary facies,the composition of gravels,the direction of paleo-current and the rock susceptibility measurement of the Hekou group suggest that the Qilian mountains had undergone three stages of tectonic uplift during the early Cretaceous.The early stage probably was lasted from ca.143 Ma to ca.123 Ma with the characteristics of fast and strong uplift;the basin was filled with the sediments characterized by the lower average value of susceptibility in the alluvial fan facies,fan delta facies,braided fluvial facies,shore-lake facies,shore-shallow lake facies from the bottom to the top.The intermediate stage spanned from ca.123 Ma to ca.113 Ma and the uplift was continued and smooth;the sediments with the higher average value of susceptibility deposited in the semi-deep lake,indicative of the basin extending to the maximum.The last stage took place since ca.113 Ma and the previous semi-deep lake shrank;the basin was filled with sediments having a relative lower value of susceptibility in the delta environment;it is argued that the Qilian mountains began fast uplift once again at ca.113 Ma and lasted out up to 109 Ma.",

The total CaCO3 percentage in sediments could be controlled by evaporation and inflow of detrital materials. The absence of aragonite is\n unusual when compared to other lacustrine sediments from the Tibetan Plateau. This could be due to low Ca/Mg ratio, low salinity,\n low Mg and Ca concentration. Monohydrocalcite might precipitate from the lake water mediated by biological activities. Low-Mg\n calcite originated from minor ostracoda shell and the precipitation of lake water with biological activities.",

Five-membered ring fused 2-pyridone compounds are effectively produced in the condensation reaction, and serve as the main building blocks to self-assemble into supramolecular nanodots under hydrogen bonding. The 2-pyridone compounds are not the sole blue species, but effectively enhance the photoluminescence quantum yield of citric acid derived nanodots. Compared with the excitation-independent emission in dilute solution, the dense nanodots exhibit red-shifted, suppressed and unexpected excitation-dependent emission. Moreover, the supramolecular nanodots have high sensitivity in various ambient conditions, such as pH, solvent polarity and metal ions.",

Here we present a rock magnetic study of the red-clay sediments from the central CLP. Our results show that frequency dependence of χ (χfd = χlf − χhf, where χlf and χhf are χ measured at 470 Hz and 4700 Hz, respectively), χlf, and susceptibility of anhysteretic-remanent-magnetization (χARM) are linearly correlated within the red-clay sequence. This linear correlation indicates that the pedogenic magnetic minerals of the red-clay have a rather uniform grain size distribution as in the loess-paleosol sequence, and the grain size is independent of the degree of pedogenesis. Nevertheless, red-clay sediments are slightly more enriched in superparamagnetic magnetic particles than the overlying loess-paleosol sediments as indicated by the higher slope of the regression line between χfd and χlf.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As the tectonical and geographical northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, the evolution of the Altyn Tagh range has attracted wide attention. Precise dating of its activities is believed essential for understanding the possible mechanisms of the Tibetan Plateau uplift and its effects on climate changes. Under the framework of basin–mountain coupling, both magnetic susceptibility and rock magnetic researches were carried out in this study on the Late Cenozoic sediments of the Honggouzi (HGZ) section (ca. 17–5 Ma) in the western Qaidam Basin to explore the tectonic and climatic evolution as well as their interactions of the Altyn Tagh range.  The obtained magnetic susceptibility record in the HGZ section displayed a two-step variation, which kept relatively low and stable values for sediments from the stratigraphic levels of 120–596 m (ca. 17–10 Ma) (stage I), but increased rapidly from 596 to 1014 m (ca. 10–5 Ma) (stage II). The rock magnetic results revealed that paramagnetic minerals or clay minerals, maghemite and hematite are dominant in stage I, which were replaced by magnetite and maghemite in stage II. A detailed comparison of magnetic susceptibility record in the HGZ section with regional tectonic and climate records was carried out. Combined with sedimentary facies, lithology and angular unconformity in the sequence, as well as seismostratigraphy data, paleocurrent and provenance analyses, the possible mechanisms for the magnetic susceptibility variation were explored. The results indicated a direct link between magnetic susceptibility change and the uplift of the Altyn Tagh range at ca. 10 Ma.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Quaternary loess–paleosol and underlying Neogene red clay sequences on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) contain a remarkable continental record of past East Asian monsoon changes and aridification of the Asian interior. While monsoon variability during the Quaternary is reasonably well understood, the evolution and dynamics of the monsoon during the Neogene are still debated. The rock magnetism of aeolian sediments is a well-established tool for reconstructing the palaeoclimatic history of Asia. Here, we present a rock magnetic record from Late Neogene red clay sediments of the Chaona section in the central CLP. The results indicate that the main magnetic minerals in the red clay are magnetite, maghemite, hematite and goethite, similar to the overlying Quaternary loess-palaeosol sequences. The high-resolution rock magnetic record, combined with the results of other proxies, demonstrate a stepwise intensification of the summer monsoon and a progressive enhancement of the winter monsoon in East Asia during the Late Neogene. Based on the results, the climatic evolution of East Asia can be divided into three intervals: Interval III, from 8.1 to 6.8 Ma, is characterized by a cool, dry climate with a relatively weak East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM); Interval II, from 6.8 to 4.3 Ma, is characterized by cool/warm cycles; and Interval I, from 4.3 to 2.8/2.6 Ma, was warm and humid, and within which the EASM strengthened rapidly and the EAWM fluctuated considerably, with an increasing trend. We infer that before 4.3 Ma the variations of both the EASM and EAWM were closely related to global cooling and that the intensified EASM during the late Pliocene was primarily caused by tectonic events, including the gradual closure of the Panama Seaway and the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, rather than by global cooling.",

It is\n widely accepted that ultrafine magnetite/maghemite grains produced during pedogenesis are responsible for the enhancement\n of χ, and loess χ on the CLP has been widely used as a proxy for the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon. However, few works have investigated\n mechanisms for the enhancement of χ in the case of surface aeolian sediments in westerly-dominated inland China, north of the Tibetan Plateau. Here detailed\n rock magnetism and grain size studies of 49 surface samples taken across the southern Tarim Basin for different rainfall/temperature/altitude\n conditions are presented. The results show that samples taken from desert have the lowest χ values and that χ of loessic sand and loess samples decreases with increasing altitude. In addition, the rock magnetism studies suggest that\n the magnetic properties of surface soils across the southern Tarim Basin are mainly controlled by the concentration of coarse\n aeolian ferrimagnetic minerals. The contribution of ultrafine pedogenically produced magnetic grains to χ is very limited.",

The redness and yellowness of soil are chiefly caused by the contents of hematite and fullonite, and their\n correlations to climate are the best in humid regions in tropic and warm temperate regions. The lightness of soil mainly correlates\n to the organic accumulation, humification and carbonatization processes, and its correlation to climate can only be found\n in the humid-arid extratropical belt. The humidity and surface roughness of soil have so strong influence on soil color that\n there are great errors on the measurement of colorness in the field. The study on soil colors of typical loess sections shows\n that soil color can record the characteristics of Asia monsoon and the global climatic fluctuations well at millennial and\n ten-thousand-year scales. It can also indicate the pedogenesis and the climatic characteristics which magnetic susceptibility\n could not be reflected in humidity areas. Therefore, soil color can be used as a new climatic proxy which is easy and quick\n to measure, and will make an active influence on the study of global changes, geomorphology and Quaternary.",

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, magnetoclimatological studies of loess-paleosol sequences in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) have\n made outstanding achievements, which greatly promote the understanding of East Asian paleomonsoon evolution, inland aridification\n of Asia, and past global climate changes. Loess magnetic properties of the CLP have been well studied. In contrast, loess\n magnetic properties from outside the CLP in China have not been fully understood. We have little knowledge about the magnetic\n properties of loess in the Ili Basin, an intermontane depression of the Tianshan (or Tien Shan) Mountains. Here, we present\n the results of rock magnetic measurements of the Ili loess including mass magnetic susceptibility (χ) and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM), high/low temperature dependence of susceptibility (TDS) and hysteresis, as\n well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) for mineral analysis. Based on the comparison with loess-paleosol sequences in the CLP (hereafter\n referred to as the Chinese loess), we discuss the possible magnetic susceptibility enhancement mechanism of the Ili loess.\n The results show that 1) the total magnetic mineral concentration of the Ili loess is far lower than that of the Chinese loess,\n though they have similar magnetic mineral compositions. The ferrimagnetic minerals in the Ili loess are magnetite and maghemite,\n and the antiferromagnetic mineral is hematite; XRD analysis also identifies the presence of ilmenite. The ratio of maghemite\n is lower in the Ili loess than in the Chinese loess, but the ratios of magnetite and hematite are higher in the Ili loess\n than in the Chinese loess. 2) The granularity of magnetic minerals in the Ili loess, dominated by pseudo-single domain (PSD)\n and multi-domain (MD) grains, is generally much coarser than that of the Chinese loess. Ultrafine pedogenically-produced magnetic\n grains have a very limited contribution to the susceptibility enhancement. Rather, PSD and MD particles of magnetite and maghemite\n are the main contributors to the enhancement of susceptibility in the Ili loess. 3) The susceptibility enhancement mechanism\n for the Ili loess is complicated and superimposes both a wind velocity/vigor model (Alaskan or Siberian model) and the in situ ultrafine grain pedogenic model; the former might play an important role in the Ili loess. 4) Magnetic susceptibility enhancements\n of the Ili loess are related not only to the eolian input of the source area, but also to the local climate, landform, and\n geological background. Therefore, great care should be taken when reconstructing paleoclimate using magnetic susceptibility\n data from the Ili loess.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The initiation of Asian monsoon systems is a complex and controversial issue, and the existence of monsoon systems in the Eocene has not yet been confirmed by commonly applicable proxy data. Eocene palynological records from three basins in southern China provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the early stage of the Asian monsoon due to their unique geographical location. The palynological assemblages suggest that the middle Eocene vegetation in southern China was composed of mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forests, accompanied by abundant subtropical to tropical evergreen taxa, thus bearing strong resemblance to the modern vegetation in southern China, and indicating a warm-humid subtropical climate. By analysing the palynological data using a coexistence approach (CA), we quantitatively reconstructed seven climatic parameters, which indicate a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature (MAT) in the range 16.5 to 23.5 °C and a mean annual precipitation (MAP) in the range 1035 to 1724 mm, similar to those of the modern subtropical monsoon climate in southern China although the MAT was surprisingly lower than present. Significant seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature and as well as the spatial distribution of MAP during the middle Eocene were most similar to those of the modern East Asia Monsoon (EAM) climate of southern China, clearly indicating that the Eocene climate of southern China was mainly influenced by the EAM, rather than the Indian monsoon (IM) or Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) monsoons. By combining the above results with previously published geological evidence, we infer that the EAM developed in southern China as early as the middle Eocene, albeit with an intensity that may have been weaker than present. The establishment of the middle Eocene EAM in southern China was most likely driven by the northward drift of the Indian Subcontinent and its collision with the Eurasian continent, associated with the uplift of the Central-Southern Tibetan Plateau, which enlarged the land-sea thermal contrast and deepened the low pressure over continental Asia in summer, thus greatly intensifying the East Asian subtropical summer monsoon over southern China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Cenozoic basin sediments around the Tibetan Plateau are valuable archives that can be used to reveal long-term interactions among tectonics, climate and weathering. However, the reconstruction of silicate weathering histories in this tectonically active region is consistently hindered by the presence of frequently embedded conglomerate and sandstone in the long sedimentary sequences. Here, we present detailed geochemical compositions of the clay components of the sediments in the Huaitoutala section (ca. 15.3–1.8 Ma) of the northeastern Qaidam Basin to reconstruct the chemical weathering history of the catchment since the Middle Miocene. Major element ratio proxies reveal evidence of four stages of change: from ca. 15.3 to 12.6 Ma, in which the clay components are characterized by relatively high Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) values (75–88, average = 81) but low mobile/immobile oxide ratios (e.g., K 2 O/Al 2 O 3 , Na 2 O/Al 2 O 3  and CaO/Al 2 O 3 ), thus indicating the occurrence of intense chemical weathering conditions; from ca. 12.6 to 6.6 Ma, in which decreasing CIA values, together with increasing mobile/immobile oxide ratios, suggesting that a long-term decrease in silicate weathering intensity occurred in the source area; from 6.6 to 2.6 Ma, in which the clay components in the sediments exhibit persistently low CIA values (66–81, average = 76.8) and high oxide ratios, which are indicative of mild to moderate chemical weathering; and since 2.6 Ma, in which the CIA values (64–80, average = 75.5) have continued to decrease with increasing oxide ratios, thus reflecting mild chemical weathering conditions. The geochemical proxy records demonstrate that the intensity of chemical weathering has continually decreased and that the Qaidam Basin has experienced continuous aridification since ca. 12.6 Ma. We suggest that Middle-Miocene global cooling-related drying has exerted a significant influence on the trend of decreasing chemical weathering intensity since ca. 12.6 Ma. In addition, the Late Cenozoic rapid uplift and exhumation of the NE Tibetan Plateau could have limited the time that the silicate rocks were exposed in the weathering profile prior to the deposition, which may have led to their weakened intensity of chemical weathering.",

        "abstract": "Paleomagnetic, rock magnetic, and grain size studies of a thick loess sequence in the West Qin Ling (mountain range) show that loess deposition there began about 800 ka. The data reveal a progressively increasing coarse grain size fraction upwards into the Holocene. The averages of these coarse size fractions are higher than in the central Loess Plateau, which was apparently farther from the source area, and slightly lower than those of the western Loess Plateau and the eastern Tibetan Plateau, which were therefore closer to the source area. The coarsening and source area location suggest (1) that Asian air circulation may have changed and intensified at about 800 ka resulting in dust deposition in West Qin Ling; (2) that dust-carrying winds were driven not only by the Asian winter monsoon, but included also the westerlies and a winter monsoon caused by the Tibetan Plateau High, and (3) that intensification of all these air circulation systems continues to the present. Increased elevation of the Tibetan Plateau so that it reached into the cryosphere by about 800 ka and a subsequent persistent uplift of the plateau may have been the mechanisms to trigger a change and intensify the air circulation system. Moreover, this circulation shift and intensification, simultaneous with a shift in Milankovitch periodicity, may have contributed to large global climate changes such as the 15% increase in global ice volume at ca. 800 ka.",

        "abstract": "Asian aridification reflects a combination of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and global cooling. Grain size analysis of the Chengdu Clay at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau indicates a rapid increase of coarse fractions at around 500 ka, suggesting a significant drying event in the source region. Comparison with results from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) indicates that this drying event occurred on a regional scale and may imply an important drying event in eastern Asia. We estimate that the rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during the middle Pleistocene may be one of the most important causes of the significant drying in the area. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The loess–red clay sequences in northern China provide high-resolution terrestrial records of Asian monsoon evolution and aridification of the Asian interior. To date, however, aeolian deposits of late Pliocene-early Pleistocene age (3.5–2.4 Ma) have only rarely been reported from the western Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), which significantly hinders our understanding of the distribution of aeolian deposits and the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the region. Here, we present magnetostratigraphic, lithologic and magnetic susceptibility results for two recently-drilled boreholes from the north bank of Baxie River, central Linxia Basin, which are highly correlative with those of the loess–red clay deposits spanning the interval from 3.6 to 2.4 Ma in the eastern CLP. Our results provide the first direct evidence for the occurrence of late Pliocene-early Pleistocene aeolian deposits in the western CLP and provide new insights into the distribution of aeolian deposits in northern China. The spatial coherence of the magnetic susceptibility fluctuations further indicates that magnetic susceptibility is a powerful tool for stratigraphic correlation of late Pliocene aeolian deposits in the western CLP. In addition, our results demonstrate that erosional events may have occurred in the early or middle Pleistocene, and they may provide new insights into the reasons for the absence of loess–red clay deposits from 3.5 to 2.4 Ma in most parts of the western CLP.",

However, an accurate picture of the GNDs and an exhaustive structure-property correlation are still lacking. Using a two dimensional photoluminescence excitation (2D-PLE) map, molecular orbital calculation, reduction level dependent PL analysis, absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved PL spectroscopy, three cases of quasi-molecular PL are determined in ethylenediamine (EDA) reduced GNDs, including the C[double bond, length as m-dash]O related electronic state, graphenol related electronic state and large π-conjugated domains. The graphenol structure is expected to be created via nucleophilic addition-elimination reactions between epoxide groups and EDA, contributing most to the blue-shifted and enhanced PL of GNDs. The multiple quasi-molecular PL provides deeper insights into the commonly called \"excitation wavelength dependent PL\". An effort is made to utilize the heterogeneous photoluminescence through phosphor-based light-emitting diodes employing reduced GNDs as a phosphor, which are capable of converting blue light into white light.",

        "abstract": "The Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault zone (XFZ) forms a prominent linear NW-SE trending tectonic feature along the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial and temporal evolution of the predominantly strike-slip movement along the fault remains unclear, as estimates for the initiation age of its different segments range from 5 to 13. Ma. The Jinhe-Qinghe fault (JqF; the south part of the Longmen Shan thrust belt) provides a key for understanding the tectonic role and deformation history of the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault zone in terms of timing, magnitude of displacement, and spatial-temporal evolution. This paper presents research on the structure and chronology of the JqF. The results of a geometric and kinematic study of the Jinhe-Qinghe fault show it to be a thrust fault with a left-lateral strike slip component; The strike slip offset extends at least 13-18. km to southwest, based on the shortening of its folds and faulting, and based on stream deflection. Ten apatite fission track apparent ages show a pronounced change in age/elevation gradient at ~ 17 ± 2. Ma, consistent with an abrupt increase of exhumation due to uplift of the hanging wall of the JqF at that time. Combined with the age of deformed Tertiary strata in the footwall of the JqF and the geometric relationships of the JqF with the Chenghai fault and the XFZ, this indicates that the JqF was active between 17 and 5. Ma. Based on the fault chronology, geometry, and movement, we suggest that the fault was a transpressional structure at the south end of the XFZ during the period from 17 to 5 Ma. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The 35.5 m thick loess section at Beiyuan in Gansu Province, China provides the most detailed record on the Loess Plateau of the periodicities in earth orbital changes during and since the last interglacial. It contains ten paleosols, one of which is in the Holocene loess, four in the Malan loess and five in the upper Lishi loess and associated alluvium. Micromorphological study of the S1 paleosol series indicates that all of the component soils were subjected to moderate carbonate leaching and biological activity. Paleosols S1-c, S1-d and S1-e developed in alluvium over a time interval equivalent to stage 5e of the deep-sea core V 28–238 . Alluvial deposition was episodic as evidenced by the separation of the paleosols. Since the development of S1-c, the terrace has not been affected by floods and has received only wind-blow dust additions. The S BC index, a ratio of the content of channels and excrements to the content of primary calcite grains, appears to be a sensitive indicator of environmental change between the arid and sub-humid environments represented by the loess and paleosols, respectively. The trends, periodicities and amplitudes of environmental change revealed by the S BC ratio are in good agreement with those derived from other indices through the Beiyuan section and with records from other parts of the world.",

        "title": "Effect of precipitation regime on δD values of soil n-alkanes from elevation gradients – Implications for the study of paleo-elevation",
        "abstract": "Highlights ► The isotopic altitude effect of precipitation controls δ D wax altitudinal gradients in mountains differing in precipitation regime and water source. ► The decrease in δ D values with elevation in the wetter region greatly exceeded those in drier region, −1.9 ± 0.13‰/100 m and −1.4 ± 0.1 ‰/100 m respectively. ► The apparent fractionation ε wax–p values for the wetter region (ca. −164‰) were more negative than those in drier region (ca. −125‰ above 3200 m). ► Atmospheric circulation and water source influence the lapse rate of δ D values with elevation. ► A reversed altitude gradient of δ D wax below 3200 m from the Kunlun Shan area suggested caution in applying this technique to dry regions. Abstract We measured δ D values of long chain n -alkanes isolated from 30 surface soil samples along two elevation transects on the Tibetan Plateau differing in precipitation regime and water source. The East Asian Monsoon precipitation dominates the wetter regime on the eastern slope (from 1230 to 4300 m) of Gongga Shan located on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Precipitation from the Polar Westerlies dominates the drier region on the slope from 1900 to 5000 m in the West Kunlun Shan on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau. The decrease in δ D value with elevation in the wetter region greatly exceeded that in drier region, −1.9 ± 0.1‰/100 m and −1.4 ± 1.0‰/100 m respectively. The apparent fractionation between leaf wax and precipitation ε wax–p values in the wetter region (ca. −164‰) were more negative than those in drier region (ca. −125‰ above 3200 m). We also measured δ D values in leaves of six common living trees (values from −287‰ to −193‰) from Gongga Shan, ranging from about 2900–4200 m. The abundance-weighted average δ D values of the n -alkanes ( δ D wax ) show a strong reverse correlation with sample source elevation ( R 2 0.78 for soils from Gongga Shan; R 2 0.85 for soils from West Kunlun Shan above 3200 m), suggesting that n -alkane δ D wax faithfully records the precipitation δ D and that the isotopic altitude effect of precipitation controls δ D wax altitudinal gradients in the mountains. The data show a fairly strong monotonic dependency of n -alkane δ D values on elevation for the eastern Plateau, but a complex relationship between n -alkane δ D values and elevation for the northwestern Plateau. The δ D wax values at sites below 3200 m from the Kunlun Shan area exhibit an unexpected positive correlation with elevation. The study confirms the potential for using sediment δ D wax values to reconstruct paleo-elevation in wetter regions, but suggests caution in applying the approach technique to dry regions. Our results also show it is essential to consider the intricacy of the pattern of atmospheric circulation and water sources and their influence on the lapse rate of δ D values with elevation. 1 Introduction The elevation history of the Tibetan Plateau (and many other mountain ranges and plateaus in the world) can provide information of general scientific interest ( Xu, 1981; Harrison et al., 1992; Li and Fang, 1999 ). Understanding the geologic phenomenon of plateau formation depends, for example, on proper reconstruction of paleo-elevation. Furthermore, tectonic events (like the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau) impact on climatic events, such as the formation of the polar ice fields and the onset of the monsoon circulation system ( Kutzbach et al., 1989; Zachos et al., 2001; An et al., 2002 ). Several approaches exist that quantitatively reconstruct past elevation (paleoaltimetry). They rely on changes in different parameters with elevation, e.g. temperature ( Ghosh et al., 2006; Peters et al., 2009 ), enthalpy ( Spicer et al., 2003 ), atmospheric pressure ( Sahagian et al., 2002 ), CO 2 partial pressure ( McElwain, 2004 ), stable isotope composition of precipitation (Poage and Chamberlain, 2000; Rowley et al., 2001 ) and plant wax δ D values ( Jia et al., 2008; Polissar et al., 2009 ). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages as a paleo-elevation indicator. Carbonate δ 18 O values have been studied most intensively to reconstruct paleo-elevations ( Rowley et al., 2001; Rowley and Garzione, 2007 ). However, beside the advantage of using n -alkane hydrogen isotope values instead of those of pedogenic minerals ( Peters et al., 2009 ), δ 18 O values of lake water (especially in the closed lake systems that occur on the Tibetan Plateau) may be affected by evaporative enrichment. The use of δ D values from terrestrial leaf waxes may overcome this problem and has been suggested as a new approach for reconstructing paleo-elevation ( Polissar et al., 2009 ), because δ D values of terrestrial leaf waxes record the isotopic composition of precipitation ( Sachse et al., 2006 ). The effect of elevation on the δ D values of meteoric water is well established and gradients between −1‰/100 m and −4‰/100 m are known (Araguás-Araguás et al., 2000). Recently, n -alkanes δ D values for surface soils along the eastern slope of Gongga Shan were shown to provide a good record of the elevation effect on precipitation δ D, showing a decreasing trend with elevation ( Jia et al., 2008 ). However, potential additional effects remain unclear. These effects may include aridity and precipitation type, which may act at the plant level on the fractionation factors. Consequently, we analyzed the δ D values of long chain n -alkanes from surface soils along two elevation transects: (i) one from the eastern slope of Gongga Shan, ranging from about 1230 to 4500 m elevation in the wet, eastern Tibetan Plateau region dominated by East Asian Monsoon precipitation; (ii) the other transect from the northern slope of West Kunlun Shan, ranging from about 1300 to 5050 m in the dry, northwestern Tibetan Plateau dominated by Polar Westerly precipitation. In addition, we measured δ D values in tree leaves from six common living species from Gongga Shan, ranging from about 2900 to 4200 m. The objectives included addressing (i) whether n -alkane δ D values show consistent trends with height along these transects in different precipitation regimes, (ii) whether height acts as the dominating factor for hydrogen isotope compositions of plant leaf wax and (iii) if unique elevation effects influence the proxy, particularly with regard to the Kunlun Shan profiles. 2 Study area, sampling and experimental 2.1 Study region: introduction and sampling The study regions include the northern slope of West Kunlun Shan, and the eastern slope of Gongga Shan (7556 m, ca. 30°N, 102°E, Fig. 1 ). A subtropical monsoon climate dominates the Gongga Shan area. The mean annual air temperature is 4.2 °C with a maximum monthly average of 23 °C in July and a minimum monthly average of −14 °C in January. The annual mean precipitation is ca. 1930 mm. Temperature and precipitation gradually decrease with increasing height over a vertical range of 4900 m, from the subtropical arid Dadu River valley to the snowline, with a warm and dry climatic at lower elevation and cold and moist one at higher elevation ( Chen and Gao, 1993 ). The vegetation changes conspicuously with height ( Jia et al., 2008 ). During the summer (June to September), the moisture on the eastern slope of Gongga Shan comes from the low-latitude western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean ( Thomas, 1997; Tian et al., 2007 ). During the winter (November to February), moisture comes from recycled continental water; but much less precipitation occurs during the winter period. In contrast, precipitation over the northern slope of Kunlun Shan decreases from 500 to 50 mm/yr as elevation decreases from 5050 to 1300 m;annual potential evaporation averages 264 mm ( Lin and Chen, 1994 ; Zheng et al., 1999). Precipitation below ca. 3000 m is especially limited by the blocking effect of other mountains on the northern slope of Kunlun Shan ( Fig. 1 ; Tian et al., 2007 ). The mean annual temperature declines upwards from ca. 10–12 °C at 1300 m to ca. 4 °C at 3200 m, and ca. 0–2 °C at 5050 m. The vegetation between 2000 and 3300 m consists mainly of montane desert, and which is replaced directly by alpine desert steppe with increasing elevation (between 3300 and3800 m), without a montane steppe and montane forest transition belt ( Cui, 1988; Zheng, 1994, 1999 ). The lowermost montane desert consists of Sympegma , Ceratoides , Ephedra and Christolea . The montane desert steppe and alpine steppe consist mainly of Ceratoides , Stipa , Festuca , Artemisia . Alpine meadow consists mainly of Kobresa , Potentilla and Carex ( Cour et al., 1999 ). The low elevation soil samples ( K low , 36°12′–36°38′N, 80°45′–81°12′E) were collected from Kule city on the northern slope of Kunlun Shan (where the climate is bone dry and the mean annual air temperature (MAT) is ca. 12 °C). The area has about 33 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP), with intense evaporation of ground surface water and strong evapotranspiration. The higher elevation soil samples ( K high , 36°33′–36°39′N, 77°0′–77°08′E) were collected from Yecheng, which maintains a dry continental climate within the temperate zone (annual mean precipitation 54 mm and mean annual air temperature ca. 11 °C). Due to the absence of a measured δ D value of the precipitation ( δ D p ) for the West Kunlun Shan transects, it was calculated by the Online Isotope Precipitation Calculator (OIPC version 2.2, http://www.waterisotopes.org ) based on latitude, longitude and altitude of sample sites. IAEA/WMO 2002 data show that the multi-year weighted mean isotopic values for March–September are −6.4‰ for δ 18 O and −40.9‰ for δ D p for the nearby Hetian station (35.6°N, 80.2°E; 1375 m; Tian et al., 2007 ), where the MAT and MAP are 12.2 °C and 35 mm, respectively. A total of 30 soil samples from a maximum depth of 10 cm from the eastern slope of Gongga Shan were collected over a one week period in October 2005, and from the northern slope of Kunlun Shan in August 2006 (after removal of the surface litter layer; Table 1 ). The Gongga Shan sample elevation ranges between 1230 and 4500 m and the Kunlun Shan samples between 1300 and 5050 m. The soil dataset provides an independent and extended replicate of results reported by Jia et al. (2008) in a study of the eastern slope of Gongga Shan, now covering a maximum change of 4300 m. This study collected additional tree leaves at each sampling site on Gongga Shan. The same number of leaves was collected at all four tree sites, from a height between 2 and 3 m above the ground. The leaves from each available species at each site were combined into one composite sample ( Table 2 ). We used an on-site handheld GPS instrument to determine longitude, latitude and elevation for all sample sites, with a precision of ca. 10 m. 2.2 D/H analysis 2.2.1 Sample preparation, n -alkane extraction and quantification The soil samples were freeze dried and ground to a powder. Aliquots (50–100 g) were used for Soxhlet extraction with CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (10:1, 56 h). The extract volume was dried using a gentle stream of pure N 2 . The dry extracts were dissolved in 1 ml CH 2 Cl 2 and fractionated using column chromatography with a column of neutral alumina over activated silica gel (100–200 mesh) into aliphatic, aromatic and polar, and acidic fractions. Saturated fractions were eluted with hexane (150 ml), aromatic fractions with CH 2 Cl 2 (150 ml) and non-hydrocarbon fractions with MeOH (30 ml). 2.2.2 Gas chromatography temperature conversion isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometry (GC–TC–IRMS) These data were obtained at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry and the analysis method followed that of Sachse et al. (2006) and Luo et al. (2011) . An aliquot (1 μl) of the alkane fraction in hexane was injected into a HP5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a DB-5 ms column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.5 μm film thickness, Agilent). The injector was at 280 °C in the splitless mode. The oven was maintained for 2 min at 60 °C and heated at 6 °C/min to 320 °C (held 10 min). The carrier gas flow was constant at 1.7 ml/min. The eluate was transferred to a high-temperature conversion oven operated at 1425 °C ( Hilkert et al., 1999 ), and quantitatively converted to H 2 , and then introduced into an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Delta plus XL, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) for compound-specific analysis of δ D values. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Peak purity was checked using mass spectrometry (GCQ, Thermo Electron, USA). All δ D values were normalized to the Vienna standard mean ocean water (VSMOW) scale using a mixture of n -alkanes (C 10 to C 32 ). The δ D values of the n -alkanes in the standard mixture were calibrated against international references (NBS-22, IAEA-OH22) using the offline TC/EA (thermal conversion/elemental analyzer) technique. The accuracy and drift of the system were evaluated via three standard measurements after every three samples (nine injections). To ensure stable ion source conditions during measurement, we determined the H 3 + factor ( Hilkert et al., 1999 ) at least once a day. The factor remained constant over the 30 day measurement period at a value of 9.1 ( SD 0.3, n = 18 ) . About 10% of the eluate was transferred to an ion-trap mass spectrometer (GCQ, Thermo Electron, San Jose, USA) to monitor possible coelution of the n -alkanes with other components. If coelution was evident from a mass spectrum, the δ D value was not used. Only peaks with an amplitude over 500 mV were used for evaluation. The standard deviation of replicate measurements for individual n -alkanes was generally <5‰, with averages of 3.3‰, 3.0‰ and 3.5‰ for C 27 , C 29 and C 31 , respectively. The precision, expressed as the average standard deviation for the standard mixtures was 3.9‰ ( n = 1620, 90 runs with 18 peaks each, n -C 14 to n -C 32 ). 3 Results The soil δ D values of the C 27 to C 31 n -alkanes from Gongga Shan range from −277‰ to −198‰ ( Table 1 ). The values for the same n -alkanes from the drier Kunlun Shan span only 20‰ and range from −203‰ to −183‰ ( Table 1 ). The δ D values of n- C 27 , n- C 29 and n- C 31 are strongly correlated at both sites, suggesting a common source (Gongga Shan soils: R 2 0.87 between n -C 31 and n -C 29 , R 2 0.89 between n -C 27 and n -C 29 , n = 18; Kunlun Shan soils: R 2 0.73 between n -C 31 and n -C 29 , n = 12). Fig. 2 shows the correlation of soil δ D values of n- C 27 , n- C 29 and n- C 31 alkanes with elevation along transects from Gongga Shan. The data showed similar trends for C 29 and C 31 n -alkanes ( R 2 0.76 for n -C 31 , R 2 0.75 for n -C 29 ). We also observed weaker correlations between δ D values of C 27 n -alkane ( R 2 0.60 for n -C 27 ), possibly due to contributions from aquatic organisms. Thus, we used the abundance-weighted average δ D values of the C 29 and C 31 n -alkanes, which is probably a more suitable recorder of the precipitation signal of δ D values of n -alkanes from leaf waxes ( δ D wax ), to compare with elevation in the following discussion. The advantage in using abundance-weighted average values is that the mean δ D values of the leaf wax n -alkanes integrate possible species-specific apparent fractionation as a result of different degrees of leaf water isotopic enrichment ( Hou et al., 2007; Pedentchouk et al., 2008 ) and hence better represent the mean isotope signal of local precipitation. Soil δ D wax and elevation correlate well linearly ( R 2 0.78 on Gongga Shan; R 2 0.85 on the higher part of West Kunlun Shan ( K high ), except for an “inverse elevation effect” of low elevation samples K low ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). The δ D wax values show a slightly positive correlation with elevation at K low . Furthermore, the lapse rate of δ D wax (−1.9 ± 0.1‰/100 m) for Gongga Shan exceeds that for K high (−1.4 ± 1.0‰/100 m, 20‰ lighter from 3836 to 4993 m), but all closely approach the rate of change in the hydrogen isotope composition of precipitation with elevation (∼1.5–2.5‰/100 m) measured along other mid-latitude mountain river profiles from moderate elevation mountain belts ( Poage and Chamberlain, 2001; Rowley, 2007 ). Our tree δ D values for n -alkanes exhibit isotopic signatures in comparable ranges (−287‰ to −193‰ for n -C 27 , −293‰ to −199‰ for n -C 29 and −259‰ to −194‰ for n -C 31 , Table 2 ) and strongly correlate with each other ( R 2 0.82 for n -C 27 and n -C 29 , R 2 0.82 for n -C 27 and n -C 31 , n = 6). Even though based on limited data, we observe a strong correlation between δ D tree and elevation ( R 2 0.72, n = 6; Fig. 3 ). 4 Discussion The stable isotope ratios of precipitation ( δ D or δ 18 O) result from an integrated function of the air mass source, evaporation conditions, transport history and precipitation conditions ( Craig, 1961; Rozanski et al., 1993 ). In theory, precipitation δ D values should correlate with the elevation of a mountain when the air mass source and evaporation remain relatively constant. This provides the foundation for the use of pedogenic clay δ 18 O to track paleo-elevation of the formation site ( Rowley et al., 2001 ). The same principles establish the foundation for using leaf wax δ D values to track paleo-elevation. Multiple climatic and environmental factors can affect leaf wax δ D values through their effect on plant source water, evapotranspiration (e.g. aridity) and vegetation type in complex ways ( Sachse et al., 2006; Hou et al., 2007, 2008 ). The strong correlations between leaf wax δ D and elevation for Gongga Shan and the higher part of Kunlun Shan suggest that D/H ratio values of soil leaf waxes can be used as a proxy for precipitation δ D variation ( Figs. 3 and 4 ), the isotopic altitude effect of precipitation controlling δ D wax altitudinal gradients in the mountains. For Gongga Shan (located in a warm wet area controlled by the East Asia Monsoon with adequate moisture directly transported from the tropical Pacific), monsoon intensity and activity will have a dominant influence on soil and tree n -alkane δ D values as a result of the relatively simple moisture source and precipitation process. These lead to the dramatic depletion in δ D values and the higher lapse rate in δ D values of −1.9 ± 0.1‰/100 m ( Fig. 3 f). Most of our soil δ D values follow a slope identical to those from the study of Jia et al. (2008) , but in both studies the soil δ D values differ from those from plants ( Fig. 3 ). Moreover, our soil δ D values (−277‰ −198‰, with apparent fractionation between leaf wax and precipitation ( ε wax–p ) from ca. −159‰ to −168‰ with increasing altitude) were all more negative than those of Jia et al. (2008) (by −242‰ to −169‰, with ε wax–p of −137 ± 9‰), possibly because isolation of n -alkanes, as performed by these authors, can result in depleted δ D values (Bai et al., unpublished results). Our ε wax–p is closer to the fractionation reported by various sedimentary and plant-based studies of n -alkanes and n -alkanoic acids from more humid climates in central and northeastern USA, southeastern Asia (e.g. Wuyi Mount, China) and northern Europe, which range up to −160‰ (e.g. Chikaraishi and Naraoka, 2003; Sachse et al., 2006; Smith and Freeman, 2006; Hou et al., 2007 ; Luo et al., 2010). Similarly, the calculated ε wax–p in eastern China varies from ca. −130‰ at 50°N to −140‰ at 20°N, and increases from low latitude sites due to variation in relative humidity ( Rao et al., 2009 ). In addition, δ D wax values for low-elevation samples (e.g. 1231 m) are consistent with that of some surface soil samples from eastern China ( Rao et al., 2009 ). The quite negative δ D wax values and ε wax–p could be attributed to the extreme humid climate, the positive water balance (precipitation < evaporation and year mean precipitation > 1930 mm) and the dense vegetation cover of Gongga Shan. However, in addition to δ D of precipitation ( δ D P ), other factors, such as relative humidity (RH) and vegetation composition, may also affect sedimentary δ D wax . The vegetation changes conspicuously with elevation along the transect. The values for plant leaf wax in woody plants range from −109‰ to 262‰, with an average of −169‰, whereas the average δ D values for grass vary from −99‰ to 278‰, with an average of −192‰. The C 3 dicots (herbs, shrubs and trees) have an approximate ε lipid–water value of −110‰, while C 4 monocots (grasses) and C 3 monocots have ε lipid–water values of −140‰ and 165‰, respectively ( Chikaraishi and Naraoka, 2003; Sachse et al., 2006; Smith and Freeman, 2006; Liu and Yang, 2008 ). On the eastern slope of Gongga Shan, C 4 plants are observed to grow only below 2100 m, while C 3 plants occur at all altitudes ( Li et al., 2009 ; Fig 3 ). Furthermore, n -alkane mean chain length ACL 27–33 and n -alkanes (C 31 + C 33 )/(C 27 + C 29 ) ratios gradually increased with increasing altitude (from 0.11 to 1.94 with an average of 0.87 and from 28.0 to 29.7 with an average of 29.1, respectively) ( Fig. 5 ), indicating an increase in grasses, which produce large proportions of the C 31 and C 33 n -alkanes. The results are inconsistent with the vegetation distributions along the slope transect and the results of Jia et al. (2008) possibly because of the different sampling locations. Furthermore, the low elevation soil samples may have been be selected mainly at the sites with trees as the dominant vegetation. The increasing trends with grasses may result in slightly more negative δ D wax and ε lipid–p values at high altitudes. As suggested by Jia et al. (2008) , beside the influence of change in water balance with altitude, we cannot exclude the possibility that the vegetation changes may produce another isotopic lapse rate that is added to the primary isotopic lapse rate of precipitation, resulting in a steeper apparent lapse rate (−1.9 ± 0.1‰/100 m). However, even with the dramatic changes in vegetation type along the surface sediment transect (especially from forest to meadow and shrub above 3500 m), ε wax–p does not differ significantly over the entire transect ( Fig. 3 ). Similar findings have been reported in a study of the same slope of Mount Gongga ( Jia et al., 2008 ) and 32 lake surface sediments across large gradients of precipitation, relative humidity and vegetation composition in the southwestern United States ( Hou et al., 2008 ). The results confirm that the combined effects of environmental conditions and vegetation have relatively little impact on the validity of sedimentary δ D wax as a recorder of δ D p and the isotopic altitude effect of precipitation is the main control on δ D wax altitudinal gradients in the mountain. The δ D tree values are generally a little higher than soil δ D wax values at the same elevation, the differences being greater at low elevation and lower at high elevation, resulting in a higher lapse rate (4.6‰/100 m; Fig. 3 g). Chikaraishi and Naraoka (2006) found similar results, i.e. that long chain (>C 24 ) n -alkanes, n -alkanoic acids and n -alkanols are gradually enriched in 13 C, by up to 12.9‰ (avg. 4.3‰) and depleted in D, up to 94‰ (avg. 55‰), from raw leaves to soils. The reason for the difference between the plants and the soil may be that (i) δ D wax values of the soil n -alkanes result from different plant types, with heavier δ D values for trees than for grass ( Hou et al., 2007; Liu and Huang, 2005 ;, 2008); (ii) diagenesis affects soil δ D wax at lower elevations where decomposition occurs more rapidly, and consequently the remaining alkanes become more enriched ( Krull et al., 2006 ) and/or (iii) the soils were deposited and formed over several thousands of years and consequently record an integrated δ D P value for a much longer time span. Kunlun Shan lies far from both the Atlantic or Pacific moisture sources. During the winter, the monsoon dissipates and the flow of the Westerlies controls west China. Although low elevation regions receive little moisture due to the blocking effect of the surrounding high mountains to their west, high elevation areas intercept substantial moisture from the Atlantic Ocean transported by the Westerlies. This decrease in relative humidity may enhance evaporation and transpiration, resulting in more positive δ D values in soil moisture and plant leaves, leading to increased hydrogen isotope fractionation ( Liu and Huang, 2005; Smith and Freeman, 2006; Sachse et al., 2006 ). Consequently, δ D wax values from Kunlun Shan tend to be more enriched due to re-evaporation, combined with mixing from local evaporation, and a negative correlation exists between δ D wax values and elevation at K high because the higher level polar Westerlies do not get disturbed ( Fig. 4 ) . Similarly, relatively small ε wax–p (ca. −125‰ at K high ; Fig. 4 ) would be expected in the transect due to extremely arid conditions and more extensive montane desert and alpine desert steppe plants ( Smith and Freeman, 2006; Jia et al., 2008; Rao et al., 2009 ). This is consistent with a surface sediment study of a transect of five Tibetan lakes from the central and northern Tibetan Plateau ( P ann ranging from 95 to 379 mm), which inferred a good relationship between δ D MW (meteoric water) and δ D of terrestrially derived n -alkanes, while the isotopic fractionation between both was found to be relatively small (−70‰ to −95‰ (mean value: −82‰); Xia et al., 2008 ). While in lake surface sediment samples from the most humid regions (southeastern Tibetan Plateau, P ann 1413 mm), ε wax/MW values are −125‰ for long chain n -alkanes, they become smaller (from −116‰ to −84‰ (mean −92‰)) at sites of northeastern and central Tibetan Plateau and Qaidam Basin ( P ann 43 mm) with a negative moisture balance ( Aichner et al., in press ). However, the positive correlation between δ D wax values and elevation along the low elevation Kunlun transect K low was unexpected, because the isotopic composition of precipitation decreases linearly with increasing elevation in most regions of the world and the observed δ 18 O lapse rates with elevation reach ca. 0.28‰/100 m ( Poage and Chamberlain, 2001; Rowley, 2007 ). However, K low collected from Kule city (annualmean precipitation (AMP) 33 mm, with intense evaporation of ground surface water and a strong evapotranspiration) has a bone dry continental climate with higher soil evaporation than K high collected from Yecheng (AMP 54 mm). Consequently, the possible isotopic effects of evaporation and transpiration on soil δ D wax are not the main factor leading to zero slopes or reversed gradients of δ D wax values and elevation along the low elevation Kunlun transect K low . On the other hand, there were no obvious changes in plant life along the Kunlun transect (montane desert between 2000 and 3300 m and alpine desert steppe between 3300 and 3800 m). Though the hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation is predominantly controlled by surface elevation in mountainous regions, studies of isotopic effects associated with precipitation have shown that δ D values also correspond closely with geography and climate ( Rowley et al., 2001; Poage and Chamberlain, 2001 ). The hydrogen isotopic compositions of precipitation and plants become lighter with increasing latitude ( Criss, 1999; Liu and Yang, 2008 ). This study shows relatively large differences in δ D values between the two sampling locations and a break in the δ D wax -elevation relationship occurs where the study region changes. We may therefore observe that n -alkanes δ D wax values for K low (36°12′–36°38′N, 80°45′–81°12′E) are much lighter than those for K high (36°33′–36°39′N, 77°0′–77°08′E). In addition, montane desert vegetation dominates at site K low , and alpine desert steppe dominates at K high . Thus, we attribute the positive correlation between δ D wax values of n -alkanes and elevation for K low to regional changes, including δ D p and vegetation. That is, elevation alone cannot explain the variance in the n -alkanes δ D wax for K low in this region. Our results from the two transects extend the ability of δ D values of leaf wax-derived n -alkanes to act as a proxy for altitude. However, the decrease in δ D values with elevation in the wetter region greatly exceeded those in drier region, −1.9 ± 0.1‰/100 m and −1.4 ± 1.0‰/100 m respectively. It is essential to consider the intricacy of the pattern of atmospheric circulation and water sources and their influence on the lapse rate of δ D values with elevation. Thus, results from more transect in different precipitation regimes and water sources are necessary to reconstruct the elevation history of the Tibetan Plateau.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The paleo-Red River is suggested to have been a continental-scale drainage system connecting the Tibetan Plateau to the South China Sea. However, the evolution of the paleo-Red River is still under debate. This study presents new results from sedimentological analyses and detrital zircon U–Pb geochronologic data from fluvial sedimentary rocks of Paleocene to Oligocene age of the Simao Basin to constrain the nature of the paleo-drainage system of the Red River. The detrital zircon U–Pb results reveal multiple age groups at 190–240 Ma, 260–280 Ma, 450–540 Ma, 1700–1900 Ma and 2400–2600 Ma for the Paleocene to late Eocene Denghei Formation (Fm.), but only one conspicuous peak at 220–240 Ma for the late Eocene–Oligocene Mengla Fm. Provenance analyses illustrate that the former likely had source areas that included the Hoh-Xil, Songpan-Ganzi, northern Qiangtang, Yidun and western Yangtze Terranes, which are consistent with the catchments of the Upper and Lower Jinshajiang Segments, whereas the latter mainly transported material from a limited number of sources, such as the Lincang granitic intrusions west of the Simao Basin. Integrated with available detrital zircon U–Pb geochronologic and paleogeographic data, our study suggests the existence of a paleo-Red River during the Paleocene to late Eocene that was truncated and lost its northern sources after approximately 35 Ma, due to left-lateral strike-slip faulting of the Ailao Shan–Red River and clockwise rotation of the Lanping–Simao Terrane.",

        "abstract": "The climate-tectonics interaction is one of the frontiers of studies on global climate change and solid earth sciences in last decades. The key for deciphering this issue is the surface erosion,and the sedimentation rate is particular. The thick molasse,namely,the Yumen Conglomerate,deposited from 4Ma to 2Ma in the Hexi Corridor of NW China,is an ideal object for the investigation of climate-tectonics interaction. In this paper,we try to decipher the chief trigger for the formation of the conglomerate. Based on published magnetostratigraphic data,during the same interval the northwestwards sedimentation rate increasing trend of the Yumen Conglomerate is coincident with the present day topography rather than the annual precipitation. During the deposition of the Yumen Conglomerate,tectonics might be the predominant factor controlling the regional sedimentation rate and surface erosion rate,though climate might still has a role to play. In conclusion,the tectonics might be the most important factor controlling the regional climate change during the Yumen Conglomerate deposited intervals.",

        "abstract": "Considerable attention has recently been paid to the magnetic properties of loess deposits in Central Asia. However, paleoenvironmental interpretations of magnetic properties of loess deposits in South Tajikistan, the Ili Basin, and the Tarim Basin remain controversial. Current meteorological observations demonstrate that the mean annual precipitation in the Junggar Basin exceeds that in the Tarim Basin and falls below that in the Ili Basin and South Tajikistan. This study of rock magnetism in loess from the Junggar Basin improves our understanding of the complicated relationships between magnetic properties, climate, and source materials for loess deposits of Central Asia. This study involved multiparameter investigations of rock magnetism in a 71 m loess section in the Dongwan area, on the northern slope of the middle Tian Shan (in the Junggar Basin). Variations in concentration of coarse eolian ferrimagnetic minerals appear to provide the main control over the magnetic properties of loess in this area. The contribution of ultrafine pedogenically produced magnetic grains to the magnetic susceptibility (χ) is minimal. Furthermore, long-term increasing trends in the c and the saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) were found in the Dongwan loess section. These trends may be linked with intensified aridification of Central Asia in the mid-Pleistocene. This study suggests that reduced precipitation of westerly moisture from Tajikistan into the Tarim Basin might play a critical role in the paleoenvironmental interpretations of magnetic properties in the loess deposits of Central Asia. © 2012.

It is expressed by the increase in eolian grain-size at Wuwei, and by a drastic extension of C4 plants and a decrease of loess chemical weathering intensity at Ganzi. Examination of the available eolian data indicates that the event has also been clearly documented in the loess sections near the deserts in northern China, and in the eolian records from the North Pacific. On the contrary, the signal is rather weak for the central and southern Loess Plateau re- gions as well as for Central Asia, where the climates are in- fluenced by the southeast Asian monsoon and the westerlies, respectively. Since the climate at Ganzi is under strong con- trol of the southwest Asian monsoon, we interpret this drying step as a result of decreased influence of the southwest sum- mer monsoon. This decrease in monsoon moisture is attrib- utable to the uplift of the Hengduan Mountains, the south- east margin of the Tibetan Plateau at ~ 250 ka ago.",

The emission colors of CDs are well-controlled at blue, green, yellow or red wavelengths by adjusting the combination of a phenol and an oxidant. And the naphthalenediol with highly reactivity and the oxidant with heavy halogen atom result in CDs exhibiting long wavelength emission. The resulting nanodots are characterized as amorphous aggregates with abundant oxygen species. The phenol-derived CDs can be used as highly processible fillers to fabricate epoxy composites, and a white light-emitting diode (LED) employing the multicolor CDs/epoxy composite as the light converter is also demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Pollen concentration (PC) has rarely been used to assess long-term paleoclimate (for example over the Miocene period), vegetation production, sedimentary environment or other factors, particularly for the Tibetan Plateau. In the western Qaidam Basin, on the northern Tibetan Plateau, PCs covering the period ~ 18–5 million years ago (Ma) were calculated and interpreted in terms of the underlying driving forces. The results show that the PCs of the most xerophytic taxa remained stable, while all coniferous taxa decreased during ~ 18–10 Ma. We attribute this phenomenon to continuous aridification, and argue that global cooling played a key role. During ~ 10–5 Ma, the PCs of all taxa increased rapidly, which is contradictory to the continuous aridification after 10 Ma in the western Qaidam Basin. The Tibetan Plateau tectonics around ~ 10–5 Ma caused a change in the sedimentary environment and consequently played an important role in the increase in PCs after 10 Ma. Thus the PC can be a useful proxy for investigations into long-term paleoclimate and tectonics on the Tibetan Plateau.",

        "abstract": "Most of the evidence for the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau comes from its southern and central parts. Although the northern rim has been less studied, it may greatly contribute to the understanding of the mechanism and timing of the uplift. Recent studies on the northeastern part of the plateau suggest that the uplift can largely be explained by Cenozoic thrusting and folding linked to the movement of the Altyn Tagh and Kunlun faults and that diffuse shortening might be a realistic way to explain the thickening of the continental interior. Nevertheless, the age of sediments that record the tectonic processes is poorly known. The terrigenous formations in the Guide–Gonghe Basin, NE Tibet, show several phases of deformation and include thick deposits of conglomerates, interbedded with sandstones and siltstones that are thought to be the result of an increased sediment flux. Dating of these gravel deposits with magnetostratigraphic and faunal studies has permitted the precise timing of the basin infilling and its tectonic evolution to be established. Our results indicate that the onset of conglomerate accumulation occurs in the Pliocene, an observation that is in agreement with those of the Linxia Basin, just east of the Plateau. If the high sedimentation rates (∼22 cm/kyr) in the Guide Basin are mostly due to tectonism, then significant uplift occurred as late as Pliocene.",

        "abstract": "Continuous Cenozoic deposits have accumulated in the Tarim Basin, northwestern China, and are crucial to investigating the aridification history of the Asian interior, which has long been thought to be linked with the growth of the Tibetan Plateau, retreat of the Para-Tethys Sea and global cooling. However, less and poor climatic records from the region hinder our understanding of the questions above. Here we report continuous lithologic (sedimentary color) and geochemical (CaCO3 and salt ions) records from precisely dated late Miocene-early Pleistocene sedimentary sequence from western Tarim Basin, NW China. They indicate that arid climate had prevailed within the basin at latest at ca. 5.7Ma and gradually increased in degree until ca. 3.7Ma. Between ca. 3.7 and 2.1Ma, a hydrologic event occurred, which supplied more water from the Tien Shan. After ca. 2.1Ma the climate in the basin turned to hyper arid. We attribute the stepwise drying of the Asian inland since ca. 5.7Ma to the late Miocene-Pliocene episodic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, Pamir and the Tien Shan and the connection of the Pamir with the Tien Shan in remote response to the collision of India with Asia. © 2013.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Lunpola Basin plays a key role in determining the elevation history of the central Tibetan Plateau, which is closely related to uplift dynamics and paleoclimatic evolution. However, accurate age constraints on the basin stratigraphy reflecting tectonic, paleo-elevation and climate information have long been vigorously debated, mostly due to a lack of absolute age controls. Here, we found two altered tuff layers in the middle-upper Dingqinghu Formation (Fm.) in the basin stratigraphic sequence. Detailed lithological, mineralogical and geochemical analyses of the tuffs indicate that they came from trachyandesite and identify analcime as the typical alteration mineral, suggesting primary deposition. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of the tuffs yields concordant ages of 20.6 ± 0.1 Ma and 20.7 ± 0.1 Ma, indicating that the end of the Dingqinghu Fm., i.e., the Lunpola stratigraphic sequence, and the uplift of the plateau to its current high elevations occurred much later than previously estimated. The contemporaneous thick black oil shales in the Lunpola deep lake and biocoenosis together suggest that the climate was humid and warm during this period.",

Homologous series (ranging from C 18 to C 22 ) and their methylated derivatives (from C 19 to C 23 ) were detected using single ion monitoring (SIM) GC–MS after pre-treatment [Soxhlet extraction, silica gel and alumina (4:1) chromatographic separation]. The series of macrocyclic alkanes exhibits an even carbon number predominance, while the methylated analogues show an odd carbon number predominance. We calculated the proportions of the C 18 /C 20 /C 22 components for the macrocyclic alkanes and those of the C 19 /C 21 /C 23 components for the methylated macrocyclic alkanes. Based on the distribution characteristics of these biomarkers, we suggest that they record information related to climate change.",

        "abstract": "As a significant pattern-recognition receptor,toll-like receptor(TLR) is essential for the natural immunity.Its polymorphism has a profound influence on responses to a wide range of pathogens and is associated with resistance and susceptibility to diseases.【Objective】This study speculated on the polymorphisms of TLR4 and function analysis of the mutation(C1027A) in its coding sequence in Suzhong pig.【Method】 PCR-SSCP was used to search the mutations of TLR4 in 127 samples of Suzhong pigs.The expression levels of TLR4 and proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β were detected by real-time PCR in porcine alveolar macrophages(PAMs) that were induced by LPS.And the PAMs were grouped by their different genotypes(CC and AC) in 1027 bp of coding sequence(CDS) to discuss whether this mutation of TLR4 influenced its sensitivity to LPS.【Result】 Three SNPs were found,including G962A,C1027A and G960A,and the first two of them were nonsynonymous SNPs and C1027A changed the character of amino acid.LPS stimulation markedly increased TLR4 and proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA expression.And PAMs had different sensitivities and response to LPS between genotypes CC and AC of C1027A.【Conclusion】The coding sequence of TLR4 was relatively conservative in Suzhong pig and this population had low polymorphism and genetic variation.The mutation in C1027A can affect the binding ability to LPS.So,allele C in 1027 bp of TLR4 is the resistance allele to Gram-negative bacterial infections in Suzhong pig.",

        "title": "High-resolution magnetostratigraphy of the Neogene Huaitoutala section in the eastern Qaidam Basin on the NE Tibetan Plateau, Qinghai Province, China and its implication on tectonic uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau",
        "abstract": "The closed inland Qaidam Basin in the NE Tibetan Plateau contains possibly the world's thickest (∼ 12,000 m) continuous sequence of Cenozoic fluviolacustrine sedimentary rocks. This sequence contains considerable information on the history of Tibetan uplift and associated climatic change. However, work within Qaidam Basin has been held back by a paucity of precise time constraints on this sequence. Here we report on a detailed paleomagnetic study of the well exposed 4570 m Huaitoutala section along the Keluke anticline in the northeastern Qaidam Basin, where three distinct faunas were recovered and identified from the middle Miocene through Pliocene. Constrained by these faunal ages, the observed thirty-three pairs of normal and reversed polarity zones can be readily correlated with chrons 2n-5Br of the GPTS. This study assigns the age of the section to the interval between ca. 15.7 Ma to 1.8 Ma. In addition, the widely used stratigraphic units the Xia Youshashan, Shang Youshashan, the Shizigou and Qigequan Formations were formed at > 15.3 Ma, 15.3–8.1 Ma, 8.1–2.5 Ma and < 2.5 Ma, respectively. We obtained a very high average sedimentation rate of ∼ 33 cm/ka over the entire interval 15.7 to 1.8 Ma. Furthermore, the average sedimentation rate is punctuated by three intervals of persistent rapid increases starting at about ∼ 14.7 Ma, 8.1 Ma and 3.6 Ma. These intervals are interpreted as times of rapid uplift and fast exhumation of the NE Tibetan Plateau. Keywords magnetostratigraphy Neogene Qaidam Basin NE Tibetan Plateau 1 Introduction The Qaidam Basin (∼ 850 km long × 150–300 km wide = ∼ 121,000 km 2 ) is the largest basin on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. It is bounded by the Qiman Tagh–Kunlun Shan (Mts.) to the south, the Altyn Tagh (Mts.) to the northwest, the Qilian Shan (Mts.) to the northeast and the Ela Shan (Mts.) to the east. It has an average elevation of 3000 m above sea level, in contrast to the surrounding mountains with elevations of 4000–5000 m ( Fig. 1 ). It has been interpreted to have been a closed inland basin since the Paleocene and is filled with a maximum thickness of ∼ 12,000 m of Cenozoic sediments (the thickest known section of Cenozoic continent sediments) shed from the surrounding mountains [1–3] . It is located in the arid region of North China, but is still affected by the front of the Asian monsoon. The sedimentary record of this basin attracts considerable attention because: (1) it contains a great potential record of the initiation and development of the Asian monsoon and of Asian aridification [4–6] ; (2) it provides a record of the ongoing growth of the Tibetan Plateau flat surface through the infilling of basins [7,8] ; (3) it provides a typical example for Cenozoic crustal detachment [9,10] ; and (4) it provides a record of the deformation and uplift of the Kunlun Shan and the Qilian Shan, especially the activation of the huge (1500 m long) strike–slip Altyn Tagh fault that has been thought to be a key boundary to transfer the deformation caused by the collision of India with Asia by continental extrusion [8,11,12] . Several tectonic models predict that either the Qaidam Basin and the northeastern Tibetan Plateau are the most recently deformed and most tectonically active part of Tibet [7,8,10] , or comprise the entirety of the Cenozoic deformed block [13] . Unfortunately, until our work, we have not had accurate chronology and paleoenvironmental and tectonic records from the Qaidam Basin to either to reconstruct the histories of the Asian monsoon and Asian desertification, or for testing the tectonic models. This lack of an accurate chronology is largely caused by a previous paucity of mammalian fossils or other means of obtaining geochronology from the thick Cenozoic sedimentary sequences. This barrier was slowly breached by a steady stream of discoveries of fossil mammals in the east Qaidam Basin since 1998 [14,15] that followed early discoveries by a Swedish paleontologist, Birger Bohlin. With few exceptions, the mammal sites are located in the northeastern Qaidam Basin in the vicinity of Delingha and Huaitoutala and span the stratigraphic interval between the middle Miocene and Pliocene [16,17] ( Fig. 8 ). We now have sufficient mammal finds that are age diagnostic to provide chronological constraints on a number of fossiliferous sections. Encouraged by these findings, we choose the Huaitoutala section, 10 km south of the village of Huaitoutala, for detailed paleomagnetic studies, because it bears seven layers of fossil mammals containing components of most of the fossil mammal groups found in the region ( Fig. 2 ). A chronology based on an integrated study of the mammalian fossils and paleomagnetic polarity reversals obtained from the relatively long and continuous section offers the best resolution possible for a continental setting that does not contain volcanic rocks that can be radiometrically dated. The absence of dateable volcanic rocks is typical of much of Asia during the Cenozoic [16] . 2 Geologic setting and stratigraphy The high relief contrast between the depressed Qaidam Basin and highly uplifted surrounding mountains is controlled by the large boundary faults between them [1,2,11,12] ( Fig. 1 ). The north Kunlun fault, derived from the Kunlun fault belt along the Qiman Tagh and the Kunlun Shan, bounds the southern margin of the Qaidam Basin. The Kunlun fault runs roughly east–west for about 1100 km and is a major strike–slip fault thought to absorb and transfer deformation imposed by the collision of India with Asia [11,12] ( Fig. 1 ). The impressive 1500-km long, NE–SW left-lateral strike–slip Altyn Tagh fault cuts through the northwestern margin of the Qaidam Basin. Between ∼ 350–400 km [18–20] and ∼ 500–700 km displacement [21,22] is thought to have taken place along the fault. This displacement has caused not only the depression and deformation of the Qaidam Basin and formation of the Altyn Tagh mountains, but has also transferred much of the deformation into the broad region of the Nan Shan–Qilian Shan, resulting in an intense uplift of the region [2,8,11–13,23] ( Fig. 1 ). The northern margin of the Qaidam Basin is bounded by the Nan Shan and the Zongwulong Shan faults (also called the south marginal fault of Qilian Shan; F 1 in Figs. 2 and 3 ) that run in a NWW–SEE direction. These faults are not only geometrically but also dynamically linked with the Altyn Tagh fault to absorb the transferred deformation and have caused strong deformation and uplift of the Nan Shan. This transfer has formed a broad thrust belt (ca. 440 km long × 65 km wide = 30,000 km 2 ) in the northern margin of the Qaidam Basin, called the north Qaidam marginal thrust belt (NQMTB), which parallels the southern margin of the Qilian Shan [1,2] ( Fig. 1 ). A series of north-dipping thrusts and their associated south-dipping backthrusts can be clearly observed in the surface, satellite and DEM images and seismic profiles within the NQMTB in the study area. These thrusts and backthrusts fall roughly into four groups of tectonic units, the Delingha depression, the Olonbuluk upheaval, the South Olonbuluk depression, and the Emonike upheaval ( Figs. 1–3 ). To the north and south of the NQMTB are the tectonic units of the Qilian Shan and the Plio-Quaternary depocenter of the Qaidam Basin, the Huobusun depression with a maximum depth of ∼ 12,000 m [1,2] . The Emonike upheaval is the front of the north Qaidam thrust belt, and exposes largely Devonian volcanic detritus and sea shelf limestone with some Carboniferous sandstone and limestone and Jurassic sandstone and mudstone with coals ( Fig. 2 ). Field observations and seismic data show that the backthrusts F 4 and F 3 of front thrust F 7 have caused a south tilted depression, the south Olonbuluk depression. The long-axis of the depression deepens southwestwards with a maximum depth of 3500–400 m occurring in the area of the Tuxi to Wulan anticlines to the southeast of Tuosu Hu (Lake) ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). These data further show that the Olonbuluk upheaval is a thin bedrock slab that was probably also uplifted by the larger backthrust F 2 of front thrust F 7 . This fault backthrusts the southern margin of the Delingha depression northward, to face the opposite thrust fault F 1 that thrusts the northern margin of the Delingha depression southward. This tectonic activity has probably given rise to the formation of the very deep NWW–SEE trending Delingha depression (∼ 3687 km 2 ) that contains Cenozoic sediments that are over 6000 m thick ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). Furthermore, the strong backthrusting of F 2 has caused the backward propagation fault F 2 that thrusts and folds the Cenozoic stratigraphy to the north of the Olonbuluk Shan to form the Keluke anticline ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). The Cenozoic stratigraphy in the Qaidam Basin has historically been divided into six formations with assigned ages. These are (in upward sequence) the Lulehe Fm. (Paleocene to Eocene, E 1–2 ), the Xia Ganchaigou Fm. (Oligocene, E 3 ), the Shang Ganchaigou Fm. (early Miocene, N 1 ), the Xia Youshashan Fm. (mid Miocene, N 2 1 ), the Shang Youshashan Fm. (late Miocene, N 2 2 ), the Shizigou Fm. (Pliocene, N 2 3 ) and the Qigequan Fm. (early Pleistocene, Q 1 ). This age assignment is largely based on pollen and ostracode analyses and has been widely accepted for geologic and tectonic studies and lithostratigraphic correlation [1–3] . The Lulehe Fm. is only found in the western Qaidam Basin along the margins of the Qiman Tagh–Kunlun Shan, the Altyn Tagh and the Nan Shan. The lithology is predominantly purple red and dark red alluvial conglomerate and gravelly sandstone intercalated with some sandy mudstone and siltstone along the basin margin and a distal facies of shallow lake siltstone and mudstone toward the basin center. It superimposes unconformably upon Early Cretaceous and other older rocks. The Xia Ganchaigou Fm. has a larger distribution area than the Lulehe Fm. and is characterized by alternate brown red alluvial to fluvial conglomerate, gravelly sandstone and brown, yellow-green sandy mudstone in the lower part and playa brown siltstone and gray mudstone in the upper part with thick salt and gypsum deposits in the depocenter close to the Altyn Tagh fault. The Shang Ganchaigou Fm. covers the whole basin and is largely interbedded multi-colored (brown to gray-green) lacustrine sandstone, siltstone and mudstone intercalated with marl and nodular limestone. The Xia Youshashan Fm. appears over the entire basin and consists largely of gray yellow and brown sandstone to mudstone with some oolite marl at the basin center and fine conglomerate and sandstone at the basin margin. The Shang Youshashan Fm. is dominated by gray/yellow-green and light brown conglomerate, gravelly sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. It contacts conformably with the underlying Xia Youshashan Fm. at the basin center but unconformably at the basin margins, especially along the western margin. The Shizigou Fm. is mostly conglomerate to sandstone intercalated with siltstone in the basin margin and yellow-gray calcareous sandy mudstone intercalated with blue-gray sandstone and gravely sandstone. It also contacts conformably with the underlying Shang Youshashan Fm. at the basin center but unconformably at the basin margins. The Qigequan Fm. is a distinctively thick gray conglomerate intercalated with sandstone and sandy siltstone–mudstone covering most of the basin. Only in the depocenter at the middle to eastern part of the basin does it change to dark gray mudstone intercalated with siltstone and muddy sandstone [1,2,24] . Our paleomagnetic section lies along the northern limb of the Keluke anticline against the northern edge of the Olonbuluk Shan, about 10 km south of Huaitoutala Town ( Fig. 2 ). It is a 4570-m exposed outcrop of the middle Miocene to Quaternary sedimentary rocks consisting of the Xia Youshashan Fm., Shang Youshashan Fm., Shizigou Fm. and Qigequan Fm. ( Fig. 3 ). The Xia Youshashan Fm. has an exposure of only 100 m, characterized by fine-grained sedimentary rocks of siltstone, mudstone and marl. The Shang Youshashan Fm. is 2250 m thick (from 100 m to 2350 m) and consists mainly of conglomerate and sandstone intercalated with siltstone for most of the stratigraphy and siltstone and mudstone in the uppermost part. The Shizigou Fm. is 1750 m thick (from 2350 m to 4100 m), and is dominated by thick sandstone intercalated with some mudstone. The Qigequan Fm. is only 470 m thick and is mainly conglomerate intercalated with thin sandy siltstone and mudstone ( Fig. 8 a). 3 Sampling and measurements Oriented block samples of roughly 10 × 10 × 8 cm were taken at intervals of 2–5 m depending on the availability of a suitable lithology at each level (site). These block samples were then cut into three oriented cubic specimens of 2 × 2 × 2 cm in the laboratory to form three parallel sets of samples for cross-calibration measurements. A total of 1650 block samples and 1650 × 3 specimens were obtained. Systematic stepwise thermal demagnetizations (in fifteen to twenty discrete steps between ∼ 25 °C and 690 °C at intervals of 50 °C below 550 °C and 10–20 °C above it) were done on the first set of specimens and the 240 pilot samples of the second set of the specimens. Remanent intensities and directional measurements were done on a 2G Enterprises magnetometer in a magnetically shielded room, first in the Paleomagnetism Laboratory of the Institute of Geology and Geophysics (Chinese Academy of Sciences) and the Paleomagnetic and Rock Magnetic Laboratory of the Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education of China) in Lanzhou University, and then at the Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island. Based on these results, only six to eight steps for temperatures between 350 °C and 675 °C were applied to the remaining specimens of the second set. The intensity of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of the clastic sedimentary samples is 1.5 × 10 − 2 to 1.6 × 10 − 3  A/m for mudstone and siltstone, and 0.6 × 10 − 2 to 0.8 × 10 − 3  A/m for sandstone. Representative thermal demagnetization diagrams are shown in Fig. 4 . Most samples show simple demagnetization behavior. Below 50–100 °C, a viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) is readily removed ( Fig. 4 ). Between 100 and 120 °C, many samples show a clear decrease in magnetization , accompanied by a clear change of remanent direction that indicates the removal of a secondary remanent magnetization (SRM) stored by goethite ( Fig. 4 a, b, c). Most samples show a low unblocking temperature component that can be removed easily at 250 °C ( Fig. 4 ). Above this temperature, a characteristic magnetization (ChRM) is clearly isolated and decays nearly linearly to the origin. Three obvious rapid decays of the magnetization were observed for most samples at about 350 °C, 580 °C and 660–690 °C, indicative of the presence of maghemite, magnetite and hematite that act as major ChRM-carriers ( Fig. 4 ). ChRM component directions have been calculated for all samples using Principal Component Analysis. Remanence directions of the specimens generally agreed between the three laboratories unless the specimens were unstable and showed noisy demagnetization behavior (∼ 10% of the total, mostly from coarse sandstones). The final ChRM direction at each site was obtained by Fisher averaging of the directions from the two sets of specimens. Specimens not included in our magnetostratigraphic analysis were rejected based on three criteria. (1) ChRM directions could not be determined because of ambiguous or noisy orthogonal demagnetization diagrams. (2) ChRM directions revealed maximum angular deviation (MAD) angles greater than 15°. (3) Specimens revealed magnetizations with virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) latitude values less than 30°. A total of 495 horizontal levels in the column (30%) were excluded. The final remanent directions are averaged for each level and then are used to calculate VGPs that are plotted as a function of thickness after various paleomagnetic tests ( Figs. 5–7 ). 4 Magnetostratigraphy All the accepted ChRM directions of the Huaitoutala section from the Keluke anticline are used for a reversal test after tilt correction. An equal area projection of these ChRM directions shows that they record signals from the dipole of the earth's magnetic field ( Fig. 5 a). A statistical bootstrap technique [25] has been used to test whether the distributions of the ChRM vectors are possibly non-Fisherian, and to characterize the associated uncertainties for both normal and reversed ChRM directions ( Fig. 5 b). The histograms of the Cartesian coordinates of bootstrapped means [25] allow us to determine a 95% level of confidence (ovals around the means in Fig. 5 a) and to demonstrate that the bootstrap reversal test is positive ( Fig. 5 b). The large change in bedding tilt along the section nearly orthogonally transecting the north limb of the Keluke anticline ( Fig. 3 ) provides an opportunity for a fold test [26,27] . 248 representative high quality (MAD < 5) site-mean ChRMs from different parts of the section were used for a calculation by the method of McElhinny [26] , which indicates a positive fold test with the tilt-dependent dispersed ChRM directions tending to cluster together around their antipolar means ( Fig. 6 ). Furthermore, a jackknife technique [28] was used to quantify the reliability of the magnetostratigraphy. The jackknife parameter ( J ) obtained for the accepted specimen-mean directions has a value of − 0.3, which falls within the range of 0 to − 0.5 recommended for a robust magnetostratigraphic data set by Tauxe and Gallet [28] . This result indicates that sampling of the section has recovered more than 95% of the true number of polarity intervals ( Fig. 7 ). Fig. 8 shows a thickness vs. VGP plot of all the accepted and tested ChRM directions. It shows that there are a total of 33 normal and 33 reversed polarity intervals recorded in the Huaitoutala section, marked as N1–N33 and R1–R33, respectively ( Fig. 8 ). The observed polarities can be correlated well with chrons 2n-5Br of the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) of Cande and Kent [29] for most of the section. First, the strikingly long normal intervals N3–N4, N18 and N29–31 can be readily correlated to the characteristic long normal chrons 2n (the Gauss Normal Polarity Chron), 5n and 5ACn-5ADn, respectively. Then, the short normal intervals N5–N8 of nearly equal duration are straightforwardly correlated to the four short normal events of chron 3n in the Gilbert Reversed Polarity Chron, as the Cochiti, Nunivak, Sidufjall and Thvera subchrons, respectively (Cande and Kent [29] ); N9–10 to chron 3An; N13–14, N16, N21–22, N27–28 and N32–33 to chron 4n, 4An, 5An, 5ABn and 5ABn, respectively ( Fig. 8 ). The two clearly normal intervals N1 and N2 at the top of the section are regarded as analogs of the Reunion and Olduvai subchrons (2r.1n and 2n) in the Matuyama Reversed Polarity Chron, because of the persistent occurrence of very coarse sedimentary rocks (conglomerate and coarse sandstone) that indicate a fast depositional rate ( Fig. 8 ). Thus, the whole section was estimated to have formed between about 15.7 Ma and 1.8 Ma. The fossil mammals found in the lower, middle and upper parts of the section provide robust constraints on our interpretation of the observed polarities. These mammals fall into three faunas in the middle Miocene, late Miocene, and early Pliocene, respectively (Wang et al., in preparation) ( Table 1 and Fig. 8 b). The Olonbuluk Fauna contains species of primitive deer Lagomeryx and Stephanocemas , as well as rhinos such as Acerorhinus tsaidamensis [15] . These taxa commonly occur in the middle Miocene of north China and are typical elements of the Tunggurian Land Mammal Age [30] . The Tuosu Fauna features possibly the earliest occurrence of a Hipparion horse [16] , as well as left over elements from the middle Miocene such as the Dicroceros deer. Presence of the three-toed horse undoubtedly indicates a late Miocene age and the Tuosu Fauna thus falls in the Baodean Land Mammal Age. The Huaitoutala Fauna currently contains small mammals only. It contains such typical Pliocene north China components as Orientalomys/Chardinomys and Mimomys and belongs to the Yushean Land Mammal Age. Thus defined, the lower Olonbuluk Fauna is estimated to occur in 12.5–13.8 Ma, the middle Tuosu Fauna at ∼ 11.4–9.5 Ma, and the upper Huaitoutala fauna at ∼ 4.8 Ma ( Fig. 8 ). Fig. 9 presents a thickness-vs.-age plot of the main chrons. It shows a linear relationship between the sampling thicknesses and chron ages that agrees to a first order (long-term change) with the lithologic change, which lends further support to our interpretation. Thus, the complete Shang Youshashan Fm. and Shizigou Fm. are determined to have formed in the intervals 15.3–8.1 Ma and 8.1–2.5 Ma, respectively. The Xia Youshashan Fm. and Qigequan Fm. are older and younger than 15.3 Ma and 2.5 Ma, respectively. 5 Tectonic implications Based on the magnetostratigraphy, the average sedimentation rate of the Huaitoutala section was calculated at about 33 cm/ka. This very high rate is punctuated by three large persistent increases that started at about 14.7 Ma, 8.1 Ma and 3.6 Ma. We interpret these unusually high sedimentation rate changes as records of three episodes of rapid tectonic uplift and fast exhumation and denudation (events T1 to T3) of the NE Tibetan Plateau for the following reasons ( Fig. 9 ). First, early Cenozoic sedimentation rates are estimated at about 4–8 cm/ka in the Qaidam Basin and the Tarim and Hexi Corridor Basins to the west and north of the Qilian Shan [31–33] , and as low as ∼ 2–3 cm/ka in the Xining Basin in the eastern Qilian Shan and Lanzhou–Linxia Basins [34–37] (see Fig. 1 for localities). Second, in the late Cenozoic, sedimentation rates in these areas are generally three to four times higher than the early Cenozoic [33,36,38,39] with maximum rates over 70–80 cm/ka clearly associated with tectonic deformation and uplift in the Gonghe–Guide Basin and Tarim Basin [40,41] ( Fig. 1 ). Third, the late Cenozoic sedimentation rate increase also broadly agrees with the tectonic evolution of a late rapid deformation and uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau from models, basin analysis and thermochronology [3,7,8,10,13,18,23,36,41–45] . Specific evidence for event T1 includes field observations of the Honggouzi anticline in the northwest Qaidam Basin ( Fig. 1 ) and seismostratigraphy of the Qaidam Basin demonstrate quite clearly that an unconformity occurs between the Shang Youshashan and Xia Youshashan Fms. close to the south slope of the Altyn Tagh and north margin of the Qaidam Basin. In our section, the first increase of sedimentation rate is also at the boundary of the Shang Youshashan and Xia Youshashan Fms. at 15.3 Ma accompanied by sharp changes in lithology from mostly fine sedimentary rocks of calcareous siltstone, mudstone and marl to predominantly coarse sedimentary rocks of sandstone intercalated with conglomerate ( Figs. 8 and 9 ). In addition, rapid cooling of the rocks due to fast exhumation of the Qilian Shan and rapid rotation of the Guide Basin just east of the Qaidam Basin are recorded since the mid Miocene [46,47] . Specific evidence for event T2 at ∼ 8.1 Ma starts at the bottom of the Shizigou Fm. and is characterized by an upward increase of thick sandstone in the section ( Fig. 8 ), and of conglomerate in other sections over the margin of the Qaidam Basin. The predominance of alternating conglomerate and sandstone is the most marked feature of the Shizigou Fm. in the basin, and is indicative of rapid uplift of the surrounding mountains [1,2] . A number of tectonic deformation and uplift events at ∼ 8 Ma have been reported around the Qaidam Basin and from various parts of the Tibetan Plateau, e.g. the Guide and Linxia Basins for the uplift of the east Kunlun Shan and west Qin Ling (Mts.) [36,41] (see Fig. 1 for locations); the Jiuquan Basin in the west Hexi Corridor for the uplift of the north Qilian Shan [44,48] ; the Altyn Tagh from thermochronology [43,45] ; the Kuche depression for uplift of the Tien Shan [33] ; the Longmen Shan for uplift of east Tibet [49,50] ; and the Yangbajing Basin for uplift of south Tibet [51] . The third sedimentation rate increase (event T3) at 3.6 Ma is not accompanied by a sharp lithologic change in the study section (even though the Quaternary section is completely dominated by conglomerate) ( Figs. 8 and 9 ), but is synchronous with the occurrence of a growing stratum dipping from 67° to 45° within a narrow interval. This stratum is clearly indicative of a synchronous folding of the Keluke anticline by a backward propagation fault F 2 from backthrust F 2 due to a push by the southern Qilian Shan ( Figs. 1 and 3 ). Seismostratigraphy confirms that this growth stratum is an overall feature around all margins of the Qaidam Basin [1,2] . An eastward fast shift of the depocenter of the Qaidam Basin was estimated to occur largely since the Plio-Quaternary [1,2,42] . Just to the north side of the Qilian Shan, an unconformity caused by the strong deformation from the Qilian Shan was paleomagnetically dated at ∼ 3.7 Ma [44] . Huge and thick boulder conglomerate due to a tectonic uplift first appeared at about this time around the rim of the whole Tibetan Plateau [38,41,44,48,52,53] , although a concurrent climatic change may also have contributed to this abrupt change [54] . Initiation of an E–W extension and graben system in northern Tibet and the formation of the Kunlun Pass Basin due to the strike–slip of the Kunlun fault and other strike–slip faults, and the basaltic eruption and fast cooling of granites on the eastern Tibetan Plateau due to rapid tectonic uplift and exhumation are all reported to occur at about this time [48,55–58] . The end of sedimentation in the study section at about 1.8 Ma is regarded as the strongest tectonic deformation due to the fast backward propagation of F 2 driven by rapid backthrusting of F 2 , leading to the formation of the Keluke fault-propagation anticline. This anticline seems to be forming a clear step cutting the north limb of the anticline to the present. This fast deformation and uplift is synchronous with the rapid fault-propagation folding of the Laojunmiao anticline with an unconformity in the Hexi Corridor to the north of the Qilian Shan, and the Ganjia and Yinchuangou anticlines and with great incision by the Yellow River in the Guide and Linxia Basins, respectively [36,41,44] (see Fig. 1 for localities). 6 Conclusions Detailed paleomagnetic studies of the fossil mammal-bearing, 4570 m Huaitoutala section has yielded a high-resolution chronology for the stratigraphy of fossil mammals in the Qaidam Basin. This thick section was determined to have been recently formed between ∼ 15.7 Ma and 1.8 Ma with the Shang Youshashan and the Shizigou formations falling in the intervals 15.3–8.1 Ma and 8.1–2.5 Ma and the Xia Youshashan Formation at > 15.3 Ma, and the Qigequan Formation at < 2.5 Ma. Three mammalian faunas, the Huaitoutala Fauna, the Tuosu Fauna, and the Olonbuluk Fauna, span the time periods of ∼ 4.8 Ma, 9.5–11.4 Ma and 12.5–13.8Ma, respectively. Our new chronology suggests a very high average sedimentation rate of ∼ 33 cm/ka for the Huaitoutala section, which is also punctuated by three rapid increases starting at about ∼ 14.7 Ma, 8.1 Ma and 3.6 Ma. These changes of sedimentation rate are concurrent with stratigraphic tilting and lithologic coarsening due to fault-propagation-folding, and are indicative of three episodes of rapid uplift and fast exhumation of the NE Tibetan Plateau at those times.

        "abstract": "Much thick Cenozoic were deposited in the western Qaidam basin(WQB),in which not only Qinghai oil field located,but the sediments that close to Altyn Tagh fault and northern marginal fault of Kunlunshan also preserves many information of basin-orogen coupling.The study of detrital apatite fission-track(AFT) data suggests that studying area has experienced an early(32-3 Ma or 4 Ma) of the compress-depressive and late(<3 Ma or 4 Ma) rapid compress-uplift of two periods.Farther analysis showed that these periods can be divided into poly-stages of tectonic-thermal processes in WQB and its around mountains since Late Cretaceous,in which Late Mesozoic(116-68 Ma),Mesozoic-Cenozoic(ca 68-62 Ma),Early-Middle Eocene(50-44 Ma),Late Eocene(ca 36 Ma),Early Oligocene(ca 30 Ma),Miocene(ca 22,16,12 Ma) and Pliocene-Quaternary(3 Ma or 4 Ma,1 Ma) stages.The AFT data reveals studying area rapid uplift only at 28.4 Ma,19.52 Ma,14.21 Ma and 8.76 Ma,but compression,tilting-uplift-denudation at margin of the basin in about 30 Ma,21.8 Ma,16.38 Ma and 7.38 Ma,corresponds to multiple thrusting of thrusts in WQB.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Since  Singer (1984)  reviewed clay minerals as they relate to paleoclimates, clay minerals have been used to reconstruct paleoclimates and environments. However, the paleoclimate information recorded by the paleo-clays in sediments will be overprinted or changed if the clay minerals undergo diagenetic transformations or post-depositional diagenetic changes, which are quite common. However, numerous studies still use clay minerals to reconstruct paleoclimates and paleo-environments. Uplift of the Tibetan Plateau since the Late Miocene has significantly impacted the sediments of the Qaidam Basin. However, due to the scarcity of fully dated sediment records, we know little about whether or not and/or how these clay minerals responded to this uplift. In order to understand their response to the uplift, in this study, we present the results of high-resolution profiling of the clay minerals from a 938.5-m borehole core (SG-1) from the Qaidam Basin (NE Tibetan Plateau). These clay minerals are mainly composed of illite, mixed layers of illite/smectite (I/Sm) and chlorite, with minor kaolinite and smectite. The clay minerals may have undergone early diagenesis. The δ 18 O-δD values of the interlayer water and the clay minerals imply the following. (a) The primary amounts of illite and chlorite were lower than those observed, while the primary amounts of smectite and kaolinite were higher than those observed; the amounts of clay minerals should be careful to be used to reconstruct paleo-environment singly; the changes in the illite “crystallinity” (Kubler Index) and chlorite “crystallinity” (Arkai Index) were related to changes in salinity and temperature. (b) Chemical weathering from 2.77 to 0.1 Ma was stronger than that at present. (c) The δ 18 O and δD of the interlayer water ranged from −11.8 to 82.95‰ and from −114.3 to 165.5‰, respectively, which was related to pore water and/or lake water undergoing strong evaporation. The isotopic composition of the interlayer water reflects variations in the pore water/lake water or of the reacting solutions, and records changes in environment. (d) The clay minerals recorded climate changes and uplift in the core, with a dramatic shift at 1.2 Ma and two different environment stages at 2.77–1.2 Ma and 1.2–0.1 Ma.",

        "abstract": "The mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) of the global climate system, marked by a shift of previously dominant 41-ka cycles to lately dominant 100-ka cycles roughly in the mid-Pleistocene, is one of the fundamental enigma in the Quaternary climate evolution. The process and origin of the MPT remain of persistent interest and conjecture. Here we present high-resolution astronomically tuned magnetic susceptibility (MS) and grain-size records from a complete loess-paleosol sequence at Chaona on the central Chinese Loess Plateau. These two proxies are well-known sensitive indicators to the East Asian summer and winter monsoons, respectively. The records reveal a remarkable two-step simultaneous enhancement of the East Asian summer and winter monsoons at 0.9. Ma and 0.64. Ma, respectively, accompanied with an onset of a clear 100-ka cycle at 0.9. Ma and of a final, predominant 100-ka cycle starting at 0.64. Ma. The mid-Pleistocene stepwise rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau could be the mechanism driving the simultaneous enhancement of East Asian summer and winter monsoons and the shift of the periodicities during the MPT by complex positive feedbacks. © 2012 University of Washington.",

Four significant tectonic episodes occurred at ~5.89 Ma, ~3.58 Ma, during ~2.88-2.58 Ma, and ~0.9-0.8 Ma, based on sedimentation, magnetic susceptibility and angular unconformities.

        "abstract": "Study on two loess sections, one located at Wuwei near the Tengger Desert in northwestern China, another located near Ganzi\n at the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau in southwest China, reveals a coeval drying step occurred at ∼250 kaBP. It\n is expressed by the increase in eolian grain-size at Wuwei, and by a drastic extension of C4 plants and a decrease of loess\n chemical weathering intensity at Ganzi. Examination of the available eolian data indicates that the event has also been clearly\n documented in the loess sections near the deserts in northern China, and in the eolian records from the North Pacific. On\n the contrary, the signal is rather weak for the central and southern Loess Plateau regions as well as for Central Asia, where\n the climates are influenced by the southeast Asian monsoon and the westerlies, respectively. Since the climate at Ganzi is\n under strong control of the southwest Asian monsoon, we interpret this drying step as a result of decreased influence of the\n southwest summer monsoon. This decrease in monsoon moisture is attributable to the uplift of the Hengduan Mountains, the southeast\n margin of the Tibetan Plateau at ∼ 250 ka ago.",

However, knowledge of the structural style and age of uplift of the ATR is limited and controversial. The Qaidam Basin, in the southeast side of the ATR, provides an outstanding field laboratory for understanding the history and mechanisms of ATR growth. This study presents a detailed sedimentological analysis of a 1040-m-thick late Cenozoic (~17–5.0 Ma) sedimentary sequence from the western Qaidam Basin, together with the analysis of sedimentological data from nearby boreholes and sections. Our aims were to determine the spatiotemporal evolution of the sedimentary sequences in the study area and to explore their response to late Cenozoic tectonic activity in the ATR. The results show three major intervals of the sedimentary characteristics in the study area: ~u003e17–16 Ma, 10 Ma and  17–16 Ma, ~16–10 Ma and ~10 Ma, during which the ATR respectively experienced tectonic uplift, fast strike-slip motion and intense uplift.",
