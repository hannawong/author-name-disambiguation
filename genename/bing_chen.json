        "abstract": "The microstructural and ultrastructural changes of germ cells during spermatogenesis of zebrafish (Danio rerio) were examined using light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Generally the process of spermatogenesis in zebrafish is similar to that of other teleosts, however, here we describe some peculiar features of zebrafish spermatogenic cells which have a limited report in this species. (1) The basic events of spermiogenesis are asynchronous, location of flagellum finished in initial stage, while chromatin condensation sharply occurred in intermediate stage and elimination of excess cytoplasm mainly taken place in final stages. (2) Surprisingly, the cilia or initial flagellae are created in spermatocytes, approach toward the nucleus of early stage spermatids, and then the centrioles depress into nuclear fossa and change their orientation to each other from right angle to obtuse angle about 125°. (3) During spermatogenesis, the chromatin compaction performs in a distinctive pattern, condensed heterogeneously from granular into chromatin clumps with central electron-lucent areas, round or long, which diminished to small nuclear vacuoles in spermatozoa. This finding demonstrates the origin of nuclear vacuoles in zebrafish spermatozoa for the first time. (4) Nuages are observed in both spermatogonia and spermatocytes. They are connected with the mitochondria and nuclear membrane, and are even located in the perinuclear spaces of spermatogonia nuclei. (5) Mitochondrial morphology and distribution shows diversity in different germ cells. The condensed mitochondria appear in pachytene spermatocytes, and mitochondria including membrane conglomerate exist in both spermatocytes and spermatids. This study was undertaken in order to disclose specific spermatogenic cells features in zebrafish that could be helpful for understanding the correlative function in this model species.",

In the controller design, radical basis function (RBF) neural networks are used to model the packaged unknown nonlinearities, and then an adaptive neural controller is systematically derived without requiring any information on the boundedness of dead-zone parameters (slopes and break-points). It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees that all the closed-loop signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability and the tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood around the origin in the sense of mean quartic value. Simulation study is provided to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control scheme. © 2013 ICIC International.",

A new Lyapunov function and free-weighting matrix method are used for filtering design, consequently, a delay-dependent design method is first proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which produces a less conservative result. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the benefits of the proposed method.",

The experimental result indicates that high performance EPS thermal insulating mortar can be made by limiting the EPS volume fraction to 80%~82%, air content to 20% or so, and fly ash content to 20%. The addition of polyvinyl acetate emulsion can improve the bonding strength and flexural strength of EPS mortar. In addition, some addition of fly ash can improve the drying shrinkage and thermal conductivity of EPS mortar, and therefore increase the comprehensive properties of the EPS thermal insulating mortar.",

Upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light, each of the diarylethenes exhibited favorable photochromism and functioned as fluorescent switches in water. Experimental results showed that their water solubility as well as absorption features, cyclization quantum yields, photoconversion ratios, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance exhibited a strong correlation with the number of phenyl-bridged glucosyltriazolyl groups in diarylethene systems. The absorption maximum, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance were significantly improved, but the water solubility and fluorescent modulation efficiency were suppressed with the increase of the number of phenyl-bridged glucosyltriazolyl groups for these diarylethene derivatives. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "Many studies have shown that rodents exhibit a certain degree of spontaneous motor function recovery even if they suffer from spinal cord complete transection injury. However, the characteristics of spontaneous locomotor recovery and its associated neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we observed that spontaneous locomotor function recovery of hind limbs could also be detected in a canine thoracic (T8) spinal cord complete transection model. In addition, the spontaneous locomotor recovery of canines could be further promoted by chronic implantation of Taxol- or human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-modified bio-scaffolds. Moreover, functional bio-scaffolds implantation promoted locomotor outcome could be significantly weakened (drop to the spontaneous recovery level) but not totally abolished by resection in the lesion site. The neurological mechanism for functional bio-scaffolds improved locomotor outcome was primarily dependent on the formation of neuronal bridging but not the long-distance regeneration of descending motor axons throughout the lesion gap. Besides that, we found that spontaneously achieved locomotor recovery of hind limbs was unable to be weaken by repetitive resection of the lesion area, indicating the mechanism for spontaneous locomotor recovery was independent on functional neurological bridging throughout the lesion gap.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of adaptive neural control for uncertain nonlinear strict-feedback time-delay systems\n with unknown virtual control coefficients. Radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are employed to directly approximate\n unknown virtual control signals, and then the adaptive neural control law is constructed by Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals\n and backstepping. In order to avoid encountering a large number of adaptive parameters when using RBF neural networks as function\n approximators, an unknown constant, instead of unknown neural weights themselves, is employed as the estimated parameter.\n This technique makes only one adaptive parameter tuned online, thus significantly alleviating the burdensome computation.\n Meanwhile, some continuous functions are introduced to overcome the design difficulty originating from the use of one adaptive\n parameter. The proposed adaptive control guarantees the boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system. Simulation\n studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme.",

In this study, we demonstrated that EriB was efficacious in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Treatment with EriB led to amelioration of EAE, which correlated with reduced spinal cord inflammation and demyelination. EriB treatment abolished encephalitogenic T-cell responses to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in an adoptive transfer EAE model. The underlying mechanism of EriB-induced effects involved inhibition of T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation through Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator Of Transcription and Nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways as well as elevation of reactive oxygen species. These findings indicate that EriB exerts potent antiinflammatory effects through selective modulation of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells by targeting critical signaling pathways. The study provides insights into the role of EriB as a unique therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the evolutionary relationships and expression patterns of the large set of genes for chemosensory proteins (CSPs) in the two main pest locusts. We used the available transcriptome and genome data to infer the number of genes using BLAST searches and sequence similarity matrices. Maximum likelihood phylogenies revealed the relationships between these CSPs and CSPs from several arthropods. RNAseq and qPCR allowed associating CSPs to locust phases. Crossing the phylogenetic and expression data allowed us to deduce homologies and conservation of the involvement in the phase change. We confirm that Locusta migratoria has at least 58 CSP gene copies, only five of which lack evidence of expression, and we reveal that Schistocerca gregaria has at least 42 expressed CSP genes. Both species share 21 orthologs, whereas 33 L. migratoria and 15 S. gregaria CSPs seem species-specific. Additional six S. gregaria and four L. migratoria CSPs seem duplications. Although the expression profiles are not especially conserved, seven orthologous CSP pairs share a gregarious over-expression pattern in adult locusts. We thus confirm that the number of locusts' CSPs is large, due to gene duplications during the evolution of Orthoptera, we establish sequence and potential functional homologies, and we highlight specific CSPs that appear to be involved in locust gregariousness either in general or in a species-specific manner.",

        "abstract": "This brief considers the problem of neural networks (NNs)-based adaptive dynamic surface control (DSC) for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) with parameter uncertainties and load torque disturbance. First, NNs are used to approximate the unknown and nonlinear functions of PMSM drive system and a novel adaptive DSC is constructed to avoid the explosion of complexity in the backstepping design. Next, under the proposed adaptive neural DSC, the number of adaptive parameters required is reduced to only one, and the designed neural controllers structure is much simpler than some existing results in literature, which can guarantee that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. Then, simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the new design technique.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the newly observed $Ω_c^0$ states at LHCb, we decode their properties by performing an analysis of mass spectrum and decay behavior. Our studies show that the five narrow states, i.e., $Ω_c(3000)^0$, $Ω_c(3050)^0$, $Ω_c(3066)^0$, $Ω_c(3090)^0$, and $Ω_c(3119)^0$, could be grouped into the $1P$ states with negative parity. Among them, the $Ω_c(3000)^0$ and $Ω_c(3090)^0$ states could be the $J^P=1/2^-$ candidates, while $Ω_c(3050)^0$ and $Ω_c(3119)^0$ are suggested as the $J^P=3/2^-$ states. $Ω_c(3066)^0$ could be regarded as a $J^P=5/2^-$ state. Since the the spin-parity, the electromagnetic transitions, and the possible hadronic decay channels $Ω_c^{(ast)}π$ have not been measured yet, other explanations are also probable for these narrow $Ω_c^0$ states. Additionally, we discuss the possibility of the broad structure $Ω_c(3188)^0$ as a $2S$ state with $J^P=1/2^+$ or $J^P=3/2^+$. In our scheme, $Ω_c(3119)^0$ cannot be a $2S$ candidate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Complete transected spinal cord injury (SCI) severely influences the quality of life and mortality rates of animals and patients. In the past decade, many simple and combinatorial therapeutic treatments have been tested in improving locomotor function in animals with this extraordinarily challenging SCI. The potential mechanism for promotion of locomotor function relies either on direct motor axon regeneration through the lesion gap or indirect neuronal relay bridging to functionally reconnect transected spinal stumps. In this review, we first compare the advantages and problems of complete transection SCI animal models with other prevailing SCI models used in motor axon regeneration research. Next, we enumerate some of the popular bio-scaffolds utilized in complete SCI repair in the last decade. Then, the current state of motor axon regeneration as well as its role on locomotor improvement of animals after complete SCI is discussed. Last, the current approach of directing endogenous neuronal relays formation to achieve motor function recovery by well-designed functional bio-scaffolds implantation in complete transected SCI animals is reviewed. Although facilitating neuronal relays formation by bio-scaffolds implantation appears to be more practical and feasible than directing motor axon regeneration in promoting locomotor outcome in animals after complete SCI, there are still challenges in neuronal relays formation, maintaining and debugging for spinal cord regenerative repair.",

METHODS The HMC were divided into normal glucose group(5 mmol·L~ -1 D-glucose, NG), osmotic group(5 mmol·L~ -1 D-glucose +25 mmol·L~ -1 mannitol, MG),and high glucose group(30 mmol·L~ -1 D-glucose, HG). The expressions of PPAR and adipophilin mRNA were assessed by using real-time quantitive PCR, and the protein expression of PPARγ was measured with Western blot. RESULTS The PPARα, PPARγ and PPARδ mRNA and PPARγ protein were all expressed in HMC in NG and no obvious changes in these genes were found in MG. The mRNA expression of PPARα was higher in HG group than that in MG group, while the mRNA of PPARγ and PPARδ were depressed in HG group. High glucose also suppressed PPARγ protein and adipophilin gene expressions. CONCLUSION In hyperglycemia, the PPARα gene expression was up-regulated, and the gene expressions of PPARγ and PPARδ were down-regulated. Otherwise the activity of PPARγ was also suppressed. These results demonstrated that PPAR signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the occurrence and progression of diabetes nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "Long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (L1 elements or LINE1) are the most active autonomous retrotransposons in mammalian genomes. In addition to L1 elements themselves, other protein-coding mRNAs can also be reverse transcribed and integrated into the genome through the L1-mediated retrotransposition, leading to the formation of processed pseudogenes (PPs) and retrogenes, both of which are characterized by the lack of introns and the presence of a 3' polyA tract and flanking direct repeats. PPs are unable to encode a functional protein and have accumulated frameshift mutations and premature stop codons during evolution. A few of PPs are transcriptionally active. Retrogenes preserve undisrupted coding frames and are capable of encoding a functional protein that is identical or nearly identical to that of the progenitor gene. There is a significant excess of retrogenes that originate from the X chromosome and are retrotransposed into autosomes, and most of these retrogenes are specially expressed in male germ cells, suggesting the inactivation of X-linked genes during male meiosis provides a strong selection pressure on retrogenes originating from the X chromosome.",

In recent years, robotic assistive devices have been widely studied for gait rehabilitation. In this paper, methods to determine user-adaptive assistance of Assistive Knee Braces (AKBs) in gait rehabilitation are investigated. A fuzzy expert system, which takes a patient's physical condition and gait analysis results as inputs, is proposed to configure suitable levels of different assistive functions of the AKB. During gait rehabilitation, the AKB generates a reference knee trajectory according to the patient's individual gait pattern, and the interaction force is controlled through a hybrid impedance controller considering the individual assistive function configuration. The proposed methods are verified through clinical pilot studies of a patient with lower limb weakness. Experimental results show that AKB with the proposed control strategies can provide effective assistance to improve the patient's gait performance during gait rehabilitation.",

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate unknown nonlinear functions, then the adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is constructed by combining Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and the backstepping approach. The proposed controller guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system, while the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. An advantage of the proposed control scheme lies in that the number of adaptive parameters is not more than the order of the systems under consideration.

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of delay-range-dependent L 2---L ¿ filter design for stochastic systems with time-varying delay. The time delay varies in an interval. A delay-range-dependent sufficient condition is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which guarantees the existence of a linear filter. The proposed filter ensures that the filtering error system is stochastically asymptotically stable and that its L 2---L ¿ performance satisfies a prescribed level. The corresponding filter design is cast into a convex optimization problem which can be efficiently handled by using standard numerical algorithms. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Telocytes (Tcs) are cells with telopodes (Tps), which are very long cellular extensions with alternating thin segments (podomers) and dilated bead-like thick regions known as podoms. Tcs are a distinct category of interstitial cells and have been identified in many mammalian organs including heart, lung and kidney. The present study investigates the existence, ultrastructure, distribution and contacts of Tcs with surrounding cells in the uterus (shell gland) of the oviduct of the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis. Samples from the uterine segment of the oviduct were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Tcs were mainly located in the lamina propria beneath the simple columnar epithelium of the uterus and were situated close to nerve endings, capillaries, collagen fibres and secretory glands. The complete morphology of Tcs and Tps was clearly observed and our data confirmed the existence of Tcs in the uterus of the Chinese soft-shelled turtle Pelodiscus sinensis. Our results suggest these cells contribute to the function of the secretory glands and contraction of the uterus.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has revealed three-dimensional (3D) culture could better mimic the stem cell niche in vivo in comparison with conventional two-dimensional (2D) culture. In this study, we found that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) cultured in 3D collagen scaffold (3D BMSCs) exhibited distinctive features including significantly enhancing neurotrophic factor secretions and reducing macrophage activations challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. To further evaluate 3D BMSCs' potential benefits to the regeneration of spinal cord injury (SCI), the 3D and 2D BMSCs were respectively implanted in rat hemisected SCI. Compared with 2D cohort, 3D BMSCs transplantation significantly reduced the expressions of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 at 5 days after transplantation, markedly enhanced axonal regeneration, and promoted motor functional recovery during 8 weeks of observation. When Nocodazole was used to depolymerize the cytoskeleton of 3D BMSCs, the changed expressions of neurotrophic factors and inflammatory cytokines were blunted, at least partially. Thus synergistic effects of neuronal protection and immunomodulation of 3D BMSCs may lead to a better functional recovery of SCI and the underlying mechanism may involve the alteration of their cellular morphology because of 3D culture. This study contributes to a better understanding of the cellular characteristics of 3D BMSCs and provides a novel strategy to promote the repair of the injured spinal cord. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "With taking broadband jamming ammunition composed of red-phosphorus, copper powder and aluminum chaff as research subject, the attenuation performance of aerosol composed of phosphorus, smoke, copper powder and aluminum chaff to infrare (IR) and millimeter wavelength (MMW) was studied by a static testing method. The transmissivities of aerosol are 10% and 7% at 3 mm and 8 mm wavelength, are 11% and 9% at 3-5μm and 8-14μm respectively. The results show that the aerosol composed of red-phosphorus, copper powder and aluminum chaff is a better broadband jamming material; every component can keep and enhance the attenuation capability of single waveband with cooperative enhancing effect; the combined method of forming aerosol is a desirable technique path at the case that the single smoking material doesn't possess broadband jamming performance.",

        "abstract": "Cochlear implantation is the current standard of care in patients with significant sensorineural hearing loss. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of cochlear implantation on ipsilateral tinnitus.With standard assessment table and standard testing program, 48 postlingual hearing-impaired adults aged 18 - 62 years (mean age at implantation: 35.0) were operated at 5 clinical centers from June 2009 to March 2010. There were 23 males (47.9%) and 25 females (52.1%). We evaluated the pre- and post-implantation degrees of tinnitus, performed free sound field audiometry and scored speech perception during different periods. Secondary analyses were conducted to examine the correlation between the effects of implantation on tinnitus and hearing or speech perception rehabilitation.Before implantation, there were 16 cases with ipsilateral tinnitus and 32 cases without tinnitus. After implantation, among 16 cases, the outcomes were recovery (n = 6), tinnitus suppression (n = 1) and no change in symptoms (n = 9). The total effective rate was 43.8%. Among another 32 cases without preoperative tinnitus, 2 cases developed tinnitus after implantation. The effects of cochlear implantation on tinnitus were negatively correlated with the course of tinnitus. There was no more correlation with other factors.Cochlear implants have significant therapeutic effects on tinnitus in 43.8% of implant users. Better efficacies are correlated with a shorter course of tinnitus. However, tinnitus suppression using electrical stimulation via cochlear implantation for deafness needs to be further evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The earth-based construction with unique advantages of wide raw material origin, energy conservation and environment protection has attracted growing attention recently. Although the mechanical properties can be improved by adding a high-efficiency stabilizer named as CSCN, it is difficult to generalize the application of CSCN due to the relatively high cost of several chemical admixtures. In this study, fly ash is introduced, and its influences on mechanical and physical properties of earth-based construction are investigated. Judged from laboratory results, mechanical properties including compressive strength and secant modulus increase as stabilizer contents and curing time increase. Water content of stabilized earth decreases due to more significant cement hydration and pozzolanic reactions by adding more stabilizer. Additionally, unit weight increases slightly with the increase of stabilizer content and curing time. The relationships of mechanical and physical properties to curing time have been estimated by hyperbolic models, and the calculation formulae for strength, modulus and physical indexes are developed. The controlling parameters of the hyperbolic models have been expressed through CSCN and FA contents by percent based on exponential regression analysis. The precision of calculation formulae is confirmed through comparing calculated values with experimental results, and the deviation is mostly lower than 10%. These results can guide the design of earth-based construction and help engineers keep track of changes in physical properties with service time.",

In this study, we used longitudinally oriented collagen conduit (LOCC) combined with nerve growth factor (NGF) to reconstruct long distance of sciatic nerve defects (35 mm) in adult dog model. The long term follow-up evaluation demonstrated that the LOCC/NGF conduit allowed functional and morphological nerve regeneration at the transection site of the injured sciatic nerve. Furthermore, the functional study confirmed that when NGF was loaded onto LOCC it promoted a better recovery of regenerated axons than LOCC alone. The gastrocnemius muscle mass in the LOCC/NGF group was significantly greater than in the LOCC alone group. The results indicated that when LOCC conduit combined with NGF it would provide a preferential environment for sciatic nerve regeneration. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Scar tissue is a physical and chemical barrier that prevents neural regeneration. However, identification of scar tissue is still a major challenge. In this study, the nerve electrophysiology method was used to distinguish scar tissue from normal neural tissue, and then different lengths of scars ranging from 0.5-4.5 cm were surgically resected in five complete chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. The NeuroRegen scaffold along with autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs), which have been proven to promote neural regeneration and SCI recovery in animal models, were transplanted into the gap in the spinal cord following scar tissue resection. No obvious adverse effects related to scar resection or NeuroRegen scaffold transplantation were observed immediately after surgery or at the 12-month follow-up. In addition, patients showed partially autonomic nervous function improvement, and the recovery of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) from the lower limbs was also detected. The results indicate that scar resection and NeuroRegen scaffold transplantation could be a promising clinical approach to treating SCI. ",

        "abstract": "Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major challenge in the clinic. In this study, we sought to examine the synergistic effects of linear ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) and human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hPMSCs) when transplanted into completely transected beagle dogs. After 36 weeks observation, we found that LOCS+hPMSCs implants promoted better hindlimb locomotor recovery than was observed in the non-treatment (control) group and LOCS group. Histological analysis showed that the regenerated tissue after treatment was well integrated with the host tissue, and dramatically reduced the volume of cystic and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) expression. Furthermore, the LOCS+hPMSCs group also showed more neuron-specific βIII-tubulin (Tuj-1)- and NeuN-positive neurons in the lesion area, as well as axonal regeneration, remyelination and synapse formation in the lesion site. Additionally, dogs in the LOCS+hPMSCs group experienced enhanced sprouting of both ascending (CGRP-positive) sensory fibers and descending (5-HT- and TH-positive) motor fibers at the lesion area. All these data together suggested that the combined treatment had beneficial effects on neuronal regeneration and functional improvement in a canine complete transection model. Therefore, LOCS+hPMSCs implantation holds a great promise for bridging the nerve defect and may be clinically useful in the near future.",

Transplantation of collagen/UC-MSCs to the ovaries of POF patients rescued overall ovarian function, evidenced by elevated estradiol concentrations, improved follicular development, and increased number of antral follicles. Successful clinical pregnancy was achieved in women with POF after transplantation of collagen/UC-MSCs or UC-MSCs.

Mycophenolic acid(MPA) concentrations were measured by high performanceliquid chromalography(HPLC) before dosing(C0 h)and at 0.5 h(C0.5 h), 1 h(C1 h), 1.5 h(C1.5 h), 2 h(C2 h),4 h(C4 h), 6 h(C6 h), 8 h(C8 h), 10 h(C10 h), and 12 h(C12 h) after dosing between days 7 and 21 postoperatively. Meanwhile, trough concentration(C0 h) of FK506, hepatic and renal function and blood cell counts were also measured. The WinNonlin software was used to calculate the area of concentration-time under the curve(AUC).RESULTS: The average MPA-AUC0-12h was40.36(μg h)/mL ± 17.20(μg h)/mL. The Cmax was 17.037 mg/L ± 7.632 mg/L, and the Tmax was 3.06 h ± 1.50 h. Individual concentrations of MPA-C0 h-C12 h were not significantly related with MPA-AUC0-12 h(r2< 0.75). FK506-C0 h, serum albumin level and Cr-CL were not significantly correlated with MPA-AUC0-12 h(all P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: The variability of MPA-AUC0-12 h is significant in liver transplant recipients early after transplantation. Single time-point MPA concentration can not reflect MPA-AUC0-12 h effectively. MPA-AUC0-12 h is less influenced by FK506 concentration, serum albumin and creatinine clearance.",

The high resolution CT (HRCT) scan and the surgical technique for diagnosis and management of bleeding of jugular bulb were also discussed.Sixty-five patients (22.6%) were diagnosed as HJB by HRCT scan, including 21 men and 44 women (P<0.01), with their ages ranged from 7 to 68 years (mean 41 years). Fourteen cases of them were on the left side, and 31 were on the right side (P<0.05). Twenty cases showed bilateral HJB. Five cases were found dehiscent high jugular bulb by CT scan and were confirmed in operation. Active bleeding was encountered in one case while elevating the pathological eardrum in hypotympanum. It was treated by pressure compression using collagen gelfoam cushion covered by muscle to protect the dehiscent bulb. The patients proceed through the planned surgery without complications.HJB might cause hemorrhage during middle ear surgery, but preliminary attention, correct treatment and awareness of the pitfalls may lessen the operation risk.",

        "abstract": "Transplantation of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived neural progenitor cells (ES-NPCs) is one promising technology for the treatment of spinal cord injury. Promoting ES-NPC survival at the lesion site is critical for the successful treatment. We tested the role of insulin in promoting mouse ES-NPC survival. Cultured ES-NPCs survived when maintained in normoxia but underwent apoptosis when exposed to hypoxia. Insulin rescued ES-NPCs from hypoxia-induced cell death. This effect could be blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002. In contrast, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitor U0126 potentiated insulin-mediated survival. Immunoblots revealed that insulin upregulated activation of Akt and inhibited ERK activation through the PI3K pathway. In addition, we showed that insulin reduced the activation of caspase-3, the key executor of apoptosis. In summary, our data suggest that insulin prevent apoptosis in ES-NPCs by activating Akt and inhibiting ERK through the PI3K pathway.",

DFT/FFT spectrum leakage occurred when nonsynchronous sampling in fundamental frequency, harmonics and inter-harmonics spectrum mutual interference affect the measurement results, the traditional interpolating windowed FFT method ignores the long-range leakage which came from other components on the concerned component. Firstly, the paper transformed the spectrum of Hanning weighted signal in IEC framework with nonsynchronous sampling, and adjusted the phase factor of spectrum, to change side lobes adjacent spectral phase difference of 180 degrees in other components, used the vector sum of adjacent lines to eliminate the long-range leakage on the concerned component, thereby proposed the group measurement method and accurate measurement method of harmonics and inter-harmonics, achieving harmonics and inter-harmonics specific parameters measurement. Based on that, proposed the harmonics and inter-harmonics separated method, and further successive removed the leakage value of other components on the concerned lines to improve the measurement accuracy, when nonsynchronous sampling without increasing the length of the sampling data, an effective solution to the harmonics and inter-harmonics cannot be accurately measured when closely spaced separation problem. Through the simulation of 10 cycles nonsynchronous sampling data, with other components and noise interferences, achieved a separation measure of 150.3Hz harmonics and adjacent 152.1Hz inter-harmonics under 5Hz frequency resolution, the relative errors are les- than 0.01%, and validated real-time and effective characteristics of the proposed methods in IEC framework.",

We found that CLL-1 expression level on blast compartment was closely linked to clinical characteristics, treatment response and survival outcome of patients. Decreased expression of CLL-1 was observed on immature compartment from AML patients as compared with controls (62.6% VS 86.9%, P<0.05). Logistic model exhibited that CLL-1low independently predicted low complete remission rate with an odds ratio of 4.57 (2.53-6.61, P<0.05). Additionally, CLL-1 expression level at diagnosis was inversely correlated to the residual blast cells (RLC) after induction chemotherapy (r=-0.423, P<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that CLL-1low was still an independent adverse predictor (P<0.05 for event-free survival, P<0.05 for overall survival). Notably, CLL-1low was able to discriminate poor survival patients from intermediate and favorable risk groups. Taken together, CLL-1 is a novel prognostic predictor that could be exploited to supplement the current AML prognostic risk stratification system, and potentially optimize the clinical management of AML.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that three-dimensional (3D) cultures provide more appropriate microenvironments to control stem cell response compared with traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures. However, the molecular mechanism involved in 3D cultured stem cells is not well known. Several microRNAs whose target genes involved in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells were found to be downregulated in 3D cultured PA-1 cells. Among them, miR-7 was predicted to target Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a key gene for self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs). We showed that the differentiation of NSCs was inhibited in 3D collagen scaffolds compared with 2D cultured cells. The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis indicated that the expression of miR-7 and Klf4 changed significantly in 2D cultures, whereas the expression stability of miR-7 and Klf4 was detected in 3D cultures. Using luciferase assay and western blot, Klf4 was identified as a target of miR-7 indicating that miR-7 plays a critical role in maintaining the self-renewal capacity through a Klf4-dependent mechanism in 3D cultured cells. Thus, the collagen scaffold-based 3D cell cultures may provide a platform to reveal the regulatory mechanism of cell regulators, which are difficult to find in traditional 2D cell cultures.",

In the in-vivo study, five filters were implanted in five adult dogs. Venography was performed after the procedure every 2 weeks until filter conversion.All filters were successfully implanted and completely converted with a mean trapping efficiency of 75.5% in the in-vivo study. The SCF was most efficient at 92% in the upright orientation with 5-mm clots and a 22-mm caval diameter. All five filters exhibited successful delivery and conversion in vitro. The SCFs were manually manufactured without barbs or hooks, and because of this feature, migration occurred.The SCF is feasible and highly efficient and converts itself successfully. Evaluation is planned of future prototypes with appropriate modifications for risk of migration of the filter.",

A novel reduced-order observer design methodology for nonlinear systems is proposed. By utilizing a newly extended reciprocal convexity inequality, free-weighting matrix technique, and quadratically inner-bounded condition, the less conservative existence conditions of the proposed nonlinear  H  ∞  observer are derived. The new sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) guarantee asymptotic stability of the estimation error dynamics with a prescribed performance  γ . Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As an environmentally-friendly construction technique, modern rammed earth stabilized with Portland cement has attracted growing interest recently. Some organic clays with high water content are used to prepare self-compacting poured earth in South China. In this study, cement-based composites (CSCN) were employed to substitute Portland cement, and the influence of organic matter (humic acid powder, HAP) on strength development of self-compacting poured earth was investigated using reconstituted organic clay by unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Due to the reduction of hydration products by adding HAP, the contribution of HAP was regarded as the consumption of CSCN and the quantitative analysis of consumption effect defined as consumption index ( OCI ) was investigated by the clay-water/CSCN ratio hypothesis. The interrelationship of  OCI  to curing time and the mathematical models for predicting the compressive strength of CSCN stabilized self-compacting poured earth with any HAP content were proposed. It was observed that the  OCI  values decreased with the increase of CSCN content and curing time. The precisions of consumption index and strength prediction models were verified by comparing predicted results and experimental results, and their deviation was mostly within 10%. The influence of HAP on phase changes in stabilized self-compacting poured earth was confirmed by XRD and SEM-EDS analysis, and the amounts of hydration products decreased significantly as increasing the HAP content.",

        "abstract": "Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) is exclusively expressed in the pancreatic islet and is essential for insulin crystallization, hexamerization and secretion. Tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein-3 (TNFAIP3) is a zinc finger protein that serves a major role in the negative feedback regulation of NF-κB signaling in response to multiple stimuli, and is a central regulator of immunopathology. Although the role of TNFAIP3 in diabetes has been extensively studied, its effect on ZnT8 has not been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to verify whether proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), are able to affect ZnT8 expression in islet cells. In addition, the study aimed to determine the effect of TNFAIP3 overexpression on cytokine-altered ZnT8 activity, considering its effect on NF-κB signaling. Cell-based studies using NIT-1 cells overexpressing TNFAIP3 were used to assess the effect of cytokines on ZnT8 and NF-κB activation, as well as the effect of TNFAIP3 on ZnT8 expression. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine the protein expression and NF-κB activation, respectively. The results indicated that cytokine stimulation led to TNFAIP3 upregulation, ZnT8 downregulation and NF-κB activation. Furthermore, TNFAIP3 overexpression protected ZnT8 from cytokine-induced downregulation. In conclusion, the current results suggest that inflammation or TNFAIP3 dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes via ZnT8 expression, besides from islet cell apoptosis. In addition, restricting inflammation and enhancing TNFAIP3 expression may exert a positive effect in diabetes prevention, treatment and pancreatic cell transplantation.",

We reported that a peptide deduced from collagenase, TKKTLRT, fused with NGF-beta could develop a collagen based NGF targeting delivery system. Our results showed that this peptide could allow fused NGF-beta bind to collagen specifically. In addition, we found that the polypeptide could result in a 2.3-fold increase in the expression level and a significant improvement of bioactivity of fused NGF-beta. In the in vivo function study, collagen membranes loaded with the collagen binding NGF enhanced the nerve growth. Thus, the targeting wound repair system could be important for the repair of peripheral nerve injury.",

In particular, we emphasize how electrospinning, freeze drying, and 3D printing technology can accomplish aligned topography and biomolecular gradients flexibly and robustly. We then highlight several applications of aligned scaffolds and biomolecular gradients in regenerative medicine including nerve, tendon/ligament, and tendon/ligament-to-bone insertion regeneration.

        "abstract": "The emerging concept is that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a central role in controlling stem cell self-renewal and fate determination by regulating the expression of stem cell regulators. miR-125b, one of neuronal miRNAs, recently was found to be necessary for neural differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs). However, the other specific biological role of miR-125b in NS/PCs is little known. We used rat NS/PCs as a model system to study the role of miR-125b in governing the behavior of NS/PCs.We report here the transfection of exogenous miR-125b inhibited proliferation of NS/PCs but promoted differentiation and migration. Whereas anti-miR-125b had the opposite effect. Similar results were observed when Nestin was knocked down by siRNA. Subsequently, we demonstrated that Nestin was a direct functional target of miR-125b. MiR-125b downregulates the expression of luciferase through Nestin 3'untranslated region (3'-UTR), and the regulation was abolished by mutations in the miR-125b binding site. MiR-125b targeted the 3'-UTR of Nestin and reduced the abundance of Nestin at both mRNA and protein levels.The results provided new insight into the function by which miR-125b modulates NS/PCs proliferation, differentiation and migration. The data also indicated the regulatory role of miR-125b in NS/PCs might through the suppression of Nestin expression.",

Excellent device performances such as low switching voltage, large resistance ratio, good cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device uniformity, and high yield were demonstrated in the fabricated 24 by 24 arrays. In addition, multi-level data storage capability and robust reliability characteristics were also presented.

This paper systematically assesses the cell-location-dependent write-access (selected cells) and disturbance issues (unselected cells) for a 3D vertical RRAM array. Using a combination of experiments and simulations, a methodology is developed to enable array-level evaluation by conducting single-device measurements and without the need to fabricate a full 3D array. Based on this evaluation method, it is found that a double-sided bias (DSB) scheme improves write-disturb tolerance by a factor of 1800 and reduces write latency by 19 % under worst-case analyses.",

        "abstract": "The physiologic actions of retinoic acids (RAs) are mediated through RA receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). The RARα gene has drawn particular attention because it is the common target in all chromosomal translocations in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a unique model in cancer research that responds to the effect of RA. In the great majority of patients with APL, RARα is fused to the PML gene as a result of the t(15;17) translocation. Three distinct types of PML-RARα transcripts, long (L), short (S), and variant (V), were identified. The V-type is characterized by truncation of exon 6 of PML and in some cases by the insertion of a variable “spacer” sequence between the truncated PML and RARα mRNA fusion partners, although the precise mechanisms underlying formation of the V-type transcript remain unclear. To get further insights into the molecular basis of the t(15;17), we sequenced the entire genomic DNA region of RARα. Of note, all previously reported “spacer” sequences in V-type transcripts were found in intron 2 of the RARα gene and most of these sequences were flanked by gt splice donor sites. In most cases, these “cryptic” coding sequences maintained the ORF of the chimeric transcript. Interestingly, two cases with a relatively long spacer sequence showed APL cellular and clinical resistance to RA treatment. In these cases, the aberrant V-type PML-RARα protein displayed increased affinity to the nuclear corepressor protein SMRT, providing further evidence that RA exerts the therapeutic effect on APL through modulation of the RAR–corepressor interaction. Finally, among patients with the L- or S-type PML-RARα fusion transcript, some consensus motifs were identified at the hotspots of the chromosome 17q breakpoints within intron 2 of RARα, strengthening the importance of this intron in the molecular pathogenesis of APL.",

With the advanced FVM technique, down to 1-ns negative biased temperature instability (NBTI) characterization was successfully carried out for Si pFinFETs at 14-nm technology node. It is experimentally confirmed that the nano-second-level fast recoverable traps, which are generated during NBTI stress, could lead to the underestimation of    ${V}_{th}$    degradation under micro-second-level measurement speed. Furthermore, it is found that even when the    ${V}_{th}$    measurement is performed within 1 ns after the stress removal, it is still not fast enough to be the real recovery-free measurement. Yet, with the proposed FVM technique, NBTI characteristics could be characterized more accurately and closer to its intrinsic behaviors.",

The injured brain tissue after ICH is surrounded by hematoma formed from hemorrhage. Fibrin is abundant in hematoma, which could be a binding target for BDNF. In this work, we have fused a fibrin-binding domain (FBD) to BDNF (FBD-BDNF), and results demonstrate that FBD-BDNF has specific binding ability to fibrin and is retained in hematoma. Using the rat ICH model induced by bacterial collagenase, injected FBD-BDNF has been concentrated and retained at the hematoma. FBD has facilitated BDNF to exert targeting neuroprotective effect to the injured brain tissue around the hematoma after ICH. FBD-BDNF has significantly reduced the hemotoma volume, reduced tissue loss, promoted neural regeneration, and improved the rat behavioral performance.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection into the masseter muscle on mandibular development in rats.12 28-day-old Wistar rats were divided into two groups as Botox group (n= 6) and control group (n = 6) which received anesthesia only. In Botox group, Botox was injected into the right masseter muscle, while only sterile saline into the left muscle. When the rats were 75-day-old, CT scan and 3D reconstruction were performed for cephalometry. The masseter muscles at both sides were weighed. Histologic study of masseter muscle and mandible was also performed.The weight of right masseter muscle was (0.4575 +/- 0.0940) g in Botox group, and (0.8899 +/- 0.1030) g in control group (< 0.05). The mandibular height II and III was (10.8 +/- 0.8) mm and (9.5 +/- 0.6) mm in Botox group and (12.5 +/- 0.6) mm and (10.7 +/- 0.4) mm in control group, respectively (P < 0.05). The intergonial distance was (11.6 +/- 0.6) mm and (12.4 +/- 0. 6) mm in Botox and control group, respectively (P > 0.05).When the rats receive Botox injection into the masseter muscle at young age, the grown-up rats have a decreased mandibular height, but the mandibular length and intergonial distance are not affected.",

        "abstract": "Decreased phosphorylation in the insulin signalling pathway is a hallmark of insulin resistance. The causes of this phenomenon are complicated and multifactorial. Recently, genomic analyses have identified ARL15 as a new candidate gene related to diabetes. However, the ARL15 protein function remains unclear. Here, we show that ARL15 is upregulated by insulin stimulation. This effect was impaired in insulin-resistant pathophysiology in TNF-α-treated C2C12 myotubes and in the skeletal muscles of leptin knockout mice. In addition, ARL15 localized to the cytoplasm in the resting state and accumulated in the Golgi apparatus around the nucleus upon insulin stimulation. ARL15 overexpression can enhance the phosphorylation of the key insulin signalling pathway molecules IR, IRS1 and AKT in C2C12 myotubes. Moreover, ARL15 knockdown can also specifically inhibit the phosphorylation of PDPK1 Ser241, thereby reducing PDPK1 activity and its downstream phosphorylation of AKT Thr308. Co-immunoprecipitation assays identified ASAP2 as an ARL15-interacting protein. In conclusion, we have identified that ARL15 acts as an insulin-sensitizing effector molecule to upregulate the phosphorylation of members of the canonical IR/IRS1/PDPK1/AKT insulin pathway by interacting with its GAP ASAP2 and activating PDPK1. This research may provide new insights into GTPase-mediated insulin signalling regulation and facilitate the development of new pharmacotherapeutic targets for insulin sensitization.",

The results of static contact angle and water uptake ratio measurements also confirmed the conjugation of heparin with the polyester. Its in vitro anticoagulation time was substantially extended, as evidenced by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) testing. Afterwards the conjugate was electrospun into small-diameter tubular scaffolds and loaded with Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) in aqueous solution. The loading efficiency was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the results indicated that the conjugate holds a higher loading efficiency than the blank polyester. The viability of released FGF2 was evaluated by MTT and cell adhesion tests. The amount and morphology of cells were significantly improved after FGF2 loading onto the electrospun heparin-PCL vascular scaffolds.",

Through treatments of Verticillium wilt by inoculation in experiment field, the physical-chemical parameters, spectrum and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of cotton leaves were measured and analyzed under disease stress. The results showed that with increasing severity level (SL) of disease, the Ch1.a、Ch1.b、Chl.a+b、LWC and LTNC, were decreased, and Car was gone up and then down in disease cotton leaves. The spectral reflectance of cotton leaves was little by little climbed from visible light region to short wave infrared region (400-2 500 nm) with increasing SL of disease. The spectral characteristic parameters of REP、OSAVI、PRI、G_NDVI、Lo、Depth672 and Area672 on leaves of disease were little by little dropped, whereas R550、R680、TCARI、R1200、R1685、Lwidth and ND672 were little by little climbed with increasing SL. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of Fv、Fm、Fv/Fm、Fv/Fo、Fm/Fo、ΦPSII were all decreased, but Fo increased with increasing SL of disease. After analyzing of correlation, it was discovered that besides Car, others agronomy, spectrum and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were all significant relationship with SL. And the correlation of was best between spectral parameters and SL, the second correlation between agronomy parameters and SL, and the better correlation between chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and SL. The spectral reflectance and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics of cotton leaves were influenced in some degree by disease of cotton, so it is variable to monitoring of cotton disease by the spectrum and chlorophyll fluorescence.",

        "abstract": "Neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. NPCs are considered valuable for the cell therapy of injuries in the central nervous system (CNS). However, when NPCs are transplanted into the adult mammalian spinal cord, they mostly differentiate into glial lineage. The same results have been observed for endogenous NPCs during spinal cord injury. However, little is known about the mechanism of such fate decision of NPCs.In the present study, we have found that myelin protein and Nogo-66 promoted the differentiation of NPCs into glial lineage. NgR and mTOR-Stat3 pathway were involved in this process. Releasing NgR from cell membranes or blocking mTOR-STAT3 could rescue the enhanced glial differentiation by Nogo-66.These results revealed a novel function of Nogo-66 in the fate decision of NPCs. This discovery could have profound impact on the understanding of CNS development and could improve the therapy of CNS injuries.",

The different operative methods,the type of the fracture,the time from the injury to operate and the age were recorded. The ankle function was evaluated by the AO FAS evaluation system through the regular follow-up. Statistics were used to find the relationship between the above factors and the ankle joint's function. Results A total of 65 patients were followed-up,with average 38 months. There were no significant differences in the outcome among the different operative methods and the time from the injury to operate (respectively,P=0.660,P=0.865).The patients'age and the type of the fracture,however,were related with the postoperative function (respectively,P=0.018,P=0.001).

        "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) are in a complex niche in which cell-extrinsic cues and cell-intrinsic genetic mechanisms in chorus mediate their cellular processes such as self-renewal and differentiation. In this study, we found that inactivation of Erk1/2 with U0126 in NSCs significantly promoted neuronal differentiation and inhibited proliferation. Sustained Erk1/2 inactivity was required in this process. We also found that nerve growth factor (NGF) and collagen could promote the proliferation and inhibit neuronal differentiation by activating phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Cell-cycle regulators such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), Cyclin D1 and Hes1 mediated the effect of Erk on NSCs proliferation and differentiation. Our results showed that Erk1/2 played an important role in the interplay between cell-extrinsic cues and cell-intrinsic genetic mechanisms in neural stem cell biology.",

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the packaged unknown functions and adaptive backstepping technique is utilized to construct adaptive controller. The proposed controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability. The main advantages of the proposed controller lie in that fuzzy basis function vectors are not contained in the proposed controller, which makes the adaptive fuzzy control scheme is very simple. And the proposed controller contains only one adaptive parameter that needs to be updated online. Simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2012 IEEE.",

The current study investigated the effects of steel slag powder (SSP) on the properties of MPC mortar. MPC mortar specimens with different content of SSP were prepared and their workability, mechanical properties and water resistance were tested. Moreover, microstructure and phase composition of MPC paste were examined by Scanning Electronic Microscopic (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. It was found that the incorporation of SSP can promote early hydration rate. A significant improvement in the later stage mechanical strength was observed but early strength was reduced. Water resistance of MPC mortar specimens was improved by increasing the percentage of SSP from 0% to 30%. Finally, XRD and SEM analysis of MPC pastes corroborated with the mechanical strength results and confirmed the formation of secondary reaction products along with the main hydration products struvite and residual magnesia.",

The endurance degradation behaviors under various operation modes can be predicted by the model, which were verified by the measured data in different devices. Furthermore, the 106 endurance for all 4-level resistance states in HfOX-based RRAM is demonstrated by using the proposed optimization operation scheme for multi-level data storage based on the model prediction. Guided by the model, a dynamic self-recovery operation scheme is developed to achieve more than 2 orders endurance enhancement at a high switching speed (10 ns). © 2013 IEEE.",

In this model, the conductive filament evolution corresponding to the resistive switching process is modeled by considering the transport behaviors of oxygen vacancies and oxygen ions together with the temperature effect. Both the metallic-like and electron hopping conduction transports are considered to model the conduction of RRAM. The model can reproduce both the typical I-V characteristics of RRAM in high-/low-resistance state (LRS) and the nonlinear characteristics in LRS. Moreover, to accurately model ac operation mode, the effects of parasitic capacitance and resistance are included in our model. The developed compact model is verified and calibrated by measured data in different HfOx-based RRAM devices under dc and ac operation modes. The excellent agreement between the model predictions and experimental results shows a promising prospect of the future implementation of this compact model in large-scale circuit simulation to optimize the design of RRAM.",

It has demonstrated in our previous work that the native human NGF-beta (NAT-NGF) fused with a collagen-binding domain (CBD) could bind to collagen specifically. Since collagen is the major component of nerve extracellular matrix, we speculated that the collagen-binding NGF would target to nerve cells and improve their regeneration. In this report, we found that the fusion protein could specifically bind to endogenous collagen of the rat sciatic nerves and maintain NGF activity both in vitro and in vivo. In the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model, we found that collagen-binding NGF could be retained and concentrated at the nerve injured site to promote nerve repair and enhance function recovery following nerve damage. Thus, the collagen-binding NGF could improve the repair of peripheral nerve injury.",

        "abstract": "Many stem cells grow into three-dimensional (3D) spheres or colonies, such as neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Sphere morphology helps maintaining the stemness of stem cells. Our previous study demonstrated that forced growth of RT4 and HEK293 cells into 3D sphere on low attachment surface could induce stem cell properties. The close relationship between 3D sphere morphology and stem cell stemness drives us to hypothesize that 3D sphere formation induces fibroblasts reprogramming. The key gene Sox2 for reprogramming fibroblasts into NPCs was found to be overexpressed in 3D sphere cultured mouse fibroblasts. These cells exhibited similar morphological and molecular features to NPCs in vitro, were capable of differentiating into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and could generate long-term expandable neurospheres while maintaining differentiation capability. When engrafted into hippocampus of adult rat brain, the 3D sphere cells differentiated into neural cells. Thus, NPCs can be generated from fibroblasts directly through a physical approach without introducing exogenous reprogramming factors.",

        "abstract": "The cataclysmic variable SDSSJ 015543.40+002807.2 is confirmed to be a\nmagnetic system of the AM Herculis type. With an orbital period of 87.13 min,\nit is also the shortest-period eclipsing Polar known. Monitoring with\nXMM-Newton finds a high-state light curve dominated by a single X-ray emitting\naccretion pole located slightly prograde of the secondary star. The hard X-ray\nspectrum is typical of radial shocks on magnetic white dwarfs (kT ~ 10keV), and\nthere is evidence for a soft X-ray component consistent with reprocessing from\nthe stellar surface. The optical circular polarization is weak (v < 3%) when\nthe accretion rate is high (mV ~ 15.5), due to optically-thick cyclotron\nemission and the apparent competition between two accreting poles. However, in\nlow states (mV ~ 18), the polarization increases smoothly to the blue, reaching\n20% at 4200A, and the flux spectrum displays a rich set of thermally-broadened\ncyclotron harmonics that indicate a polar field of 29MG. The phase interval\npreceding the 6.5 min eclipse depicts the development of P-Cygni components\nfollowed by complete absorption reversals in the emission lines. This\nphenomenon is not unexpected for a strongly accreting magnetic system viewed\nthrough the cool base of the funnel, and high-quality spectroscopy through this\ninterval will likely lead to new insights into the dynamics of magnetic\ncoupling and gas flow onto the white dwarf.",

Then, the values of Regge slopes and Regge intercepts for baryons containing one, two, or three bottom quarks are calculated. After that, masses of the orbitally excited singly, doubly, and triply bottom baryons are estimated.

        "abstract": "Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease that affects large and medium size arteries. The brachiocephalic trunk is the most frequently involved site in TA, and multi-vessel lesions are common. Surgical treatment includes vessel reconstruction surgery and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Herein, we report our preliminary experience with surgical treatment of cerebral ischemia caused by cervical arterial lesions due to TA.From January 2000 to December 2007, 38 patients with cerebral ischemia caused by cervical arterial occlusive lesions due to TA were treated surgically. There were three males and 35 females, with an age range of 15 - 42 years (mean 26.5 years). All patients had operative repairs undertaken. Twenty eight patients received bypass operation and 10 patients received percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. One case with coronary stenosis received coronary artery bypass simultaneously. Patients were followed up for 11 months to eight years.There were no peri-operative deaths in cerebrovascular reconstruction patients. Symptoms of cerebral ischemia were improved or cured in 25 of 38 patients. There was a low incidence of cerebral reperfusion syndrome. Two patients died at five and seven years after surgery due to heart failure. Another 8 patients (20%) required further surgery for stenosis (5 patients) or anastomotic aneurysms (3 patients). Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed successfully for treatment of aortic and renal lesions. Repeated angioplasty for revascularization was performed in six PTA cases with restenosis after 5 - 24 months.When cerebral perfusion has potential to be affected by TA, a definitive corrective procedure is advised when the patient is relatively stable. Although the recurrence rate is very high, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is the first choice procedure. Bypass operation is optimal for brachiocephalic-vessel involvement in TA. Cerebral reperfusion syndrome can be avoided by careful selection of the operation method and improved post-operative treatment.",

Limited sampling strategies to predict MPA area under the concentration-time curve have also been described, and the value of clinical use needs to be investigated in future. The published data suggested that a fixed-dosage MMF regimen might not be suitable and monitoring of MPA exposure seems helpful in various clinical settings of liver transplantation.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the finite-time tracking problem of nonlinear pure-feedback systems. Unlike the literature on traditional finite-time stabilization, in this paper the nonlinear system functions, including the bounding functions, are all totally unknown. Fuzzy logic systems are used to model those unknown functions. To present a finite-time control strategy, a criterion of semiglobal practical stability in finite time is first developed. Based on this criterion, a novel adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed by a backstepping technique. It is shown that the presented controller can guarantee that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in a finite time, and the other closed-loop signals remain bounded. Finally, two examples are used to test the effectiveness of proposed control strategy.",

Blocked angiogenesis is the main pathological change in the scarred endometrium. The fibroblast growth factor 2 (bFGF), a member of FGF family, is usually applied to promote healing of refractory ulcer and contributes to angiogenesis of tissues. In this study, the sustained-release system of bFGF 100 µg was administrated around scarred endometrium guiding by ultrasound every 4 weeks in 18 patients (2-4 times). Results showed that after treatment, the menstrual blood volume, endometrial thickness and the scarred endometrial area were improved. Histological study showed blood vessel density increased obviously. Three patients (3/18) achieved pregnancy over 20 gestational weeks. Therefore, administrating the bFGF surrounding scarred endometrium may provide a new therapeutic approach for the patients with endometrial fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "This correspondence studies the problem of observer-based Hinfin control for time-delay Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems. It provides a delay-dependent linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based method for the control design. It is known that the key important problem in the literature, even for delay-independent case, lies in the difficulty of decoupling matrix variables in corresponding matrix inequalities. This correspondence suggests a decoupling technique for solving matrix inequalities with coupled variables, and provides an LMI-based algorithm by adopting the idea of the cone complementarity problem. The derivation relies on the appropriate choice of Lyaponuv-Krasovskii functionals which incorporate the intersections among local systems. Illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of the present delay-dependent result.",

        "abstract": "To develop a safe and novel immunoadjuvant to enhance the immunity and resistance of animals against E. coli infection.An 88-base immunostimulatory oligodeoxynuleotide containing eleven CpG motifs (CpG ODN) was synthesized and amplified by PCR. The chitosan nanoparticle (CNP) was prepared by ion linking method to entrap the CpG ODN that significantly promotes the proliferation of lymphocytes of pig in vitro. Then the CpG-CNP was inoculated into 21-day old Kunming mice, which were orally challenged with virulent K88/K99 E. Coli 35 days after inoculation. Blood was collected from the tail vein of mice on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 after inoculation to detect the changes and content of immunoglobulins, cytokines and immune cells by ELISA, such as IgG, IgA, IgM, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6.The CpG provoked remarkable proliferation of lymphocytes of pig in vitro in comparison with that of control group (P < 0.05). The inoculation with CpG-CNP significantly raised the content of IgG, IgM, and IgA in the sera of immunized mice (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 in the mice significantly increased in comparison with those in controls (P < 0.05), so was the number of white blood cells and lymphocytes in immunized mice. The humoral and cellular immunities were significantly enhanced in immunized mice, which resisted the infection of E. coli and survived, while the control mice manifested evident symptoms and lesions of infection.CpG-CNP can significantly promote cellular and humoral immunity and resistance of mice against E. coil infection, and can be utilized as an effective adjuvant to improve the immunoprotection and resistance of porcine against infectious disease.",

Vertical velocity and pitch angular velocity of sprung mass, and their change rate, were chosen as the inputs of fuzzy controllers, and the control of vehicle semi-active suspension was done with the use of double fuzzy controllers, which attained the comprehensive goal of vehicle vertical and pitching vibration. Meanwhile, a vehicle semi-active suspension model was chosen as the object for this simulation analysis. The results of simulation demonstrate that the fuzzy control mentioned above can not only improve the ride comfort, but also decrease the probability of suspension broke up.",

To date, the bone repair of spina bifida for young children is a significant challenge in clinical practice.  Bovine bone collagen particle (BBCP) scaffolds combined with human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) were implanted in the defect area. X-ray analysis was performed after 3 months. Tissues were harvested for gross observation, and histological and immunohistochemical staining.  The BBCP supported hUC-MSCs adhesion and growth. Implanted BBCP combined with hUC-MSCs also promoted bone regeneration in the vertebral lamina and arch defect area.  This method represents a new strategy for vertebral lamina and arch reconstruction in children.",

METHODS: Porcine carotid arteries were decellularized using conventional trypsin-EDTA plus 1% TritonX-100 and 0.1% ammonia in order for 4, 5, and 6 hours. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Porcine carotid arteries were decellularized by trypsin, ammonium hydroxide and non-ionic detergent to extract all the cell components of the grafts successfully. To obtain better pore size and porosity of the acellular scaffold, we changed the methods by extending the time of trypsin. By extending the time of trypsin methods, the better pore size and porosity of the acellular scaffold was obtained.

        "abstract": "A novel adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is proposed for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear time-delay systems with unknown virtual control coefficients. The unknown time delays are compensated for by introducing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Fuzzy logic systems in Mamdani type are used to approximate unknown nonlinear functions. The decoupled backstepping approach is applied to construct an adaptive fuzzy tracking controller which guarantees semi-global uniform ultimate bound-edness of all the signals in the closed-loop system and the tracking error to converge to a small neighborhood around the origin. The proposed design scheme contains less adaptive parameters than the existing results and efficiently overcomes the controller singularity problem. Finally, a simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure. ICIC International © 2008.",

        "title": "Mandarin Chinese speech recognition by pediatric cochlear implant users.",
        "abstract": "Because of difficulties associated with pediatric speech testing, most pediatric cochlear implant (CI) speech studies necessarily involve basic and simple perceptual tasks. There are relatively few studies regarding Mandarin-speaking pediatric CI users' perception of more difficult speech materials (e.g., words and sentences produced by multiple talkers). Difficult speech materials and tests necessarily require older pediatric CI users, who may have different etiologies of hearing loss, duration of deafness, CI experience. The present study investigated how pediatric CI patient demographics influence speech recognition performance with relatively difficult test materials and methods.In this study, open-set recognition of multi-talker (two males and two females) Mandarin Chinese disyllables and sentences were measured in 37 Mandarin-speaking pediatric CI users. Subjects were grouped according to etiology of deafness and previous acoustic hearing experience. Group 1 subjects were all congenitally deafened with little-to-no acoustic hearing experience. Group 2 subjects were not congenitally deafened and had substantial acoustic hearing experience prior to implantation. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed within each group using subject demographics such as age at implantation and age at testing.Pediatric CI performance was generally quite good. For Group 1, mean performance was 82.3% correct for disyllables and 82.8% correct for sentences. For Group 2, mean performance was 76.6% correct for disyllables and 84.4% correct for sentences. For Group 1, multiple linear regression analyses showed that age at implantation predicted disyllable recognition, and that age at implantation and age at testing predicted sentence recognition. For Group 2, neither age at implantation nor age at testing predicted disyllable or sentence recognition. Performance was significantly better with the female than with the male talkers.Consistent with previous studies' findings, early implantation provided a significant advantage for profoundly deaf children. Performance for both groups was generally quite good for the relatively difficult materials and tasks, suggesting that open-set word and sentence recognition may be useful in evaluating speech performance with older pediatric CI users. Differences in disyllable recognition between Groups 1 and 2 may reflect differences in adaptation to electric stimulation. The Group 1 subjects developed speech patterns exclusively via electric stimulation, while the Group 2 subjects adapted to electric stimulation relative to previous acoustic patterns.",

        "abstract": "For the first time, nano-meter-scaled 1T-1R non-volatile memory (NVM) architecture comprising of RRAM cells built on vertical GAA nano-pillar transistors, either junction-less or junction-based, is systematically investigated. Transistors are fabricated using fully CMOS compatible technology and RRAM cells are stacked onto the tip of the nano-pillars (with a diameter down to ∼37nm) to achieve a compact 4F2 footprint. In addition, through this platform, different RRAM stacks comprising CMOS friendly materials are studied, and it is found that TiN/Ni/HfO2/n+-Si RRAM cells show excellent switching properties in either bipolar or unipolar mode, including (1) ultra-low switching current/power: SET ∼20nA/85nW and RESET ∼200pA/700pW, (2) multi-level switchability, (3) good endurance, >10 5, (4) satisfactory retention, 10 years at 85oC; and (5) fast switching speed ∼50ns. Moreover, this vertical (gate-all-around) GAA nano-pillar based 1T-1R architecture provides a more direct and flexible test vehicle to verify the scalability and functionality of RRAM candidates with a dimension close to actual application. © 2012 IEEE.",

All subjects were given a single dose of 500 mg sulphadimidine (SM(2)). The plasma concentration of SM(2) and acetyl-SM(2) (AcSM(2)) 6 h after administration was determined. Molar metabolic ratio (MR) was calculated by the ratio of AcSM(2) to AcSM(2)+SM(2).Totals of 53 (44.2%), 47 (39.2%) and 20 (16.7%) subjects were homozygotes for wild type (wt/wt), heterozygotes for mutant (m/wt) and homozygotes for mutant (m/m), respectively. The MR of 120 subjects was 0.714+/-0.237. Twenty subjects (16.7%) were classified as poor metabolizers. All subjects in the m/m group were poor metabolizers. The MRs of the wt/wt, m/wt and m/m groups were 0.886+/-0.060, 0.719+/-0.089 and 0.246+/-0.105 (P<0.001), respectively. There was a significant difference between different NAT2 m/wt genotypes (P<0.001) and m/m genotypes (P<0.001). MR correlated well with NAT2 genotypes (r=0.947).Various NAT2 genotypes have a significant impact on the metabolic activity of NAT2 in Chinese people.",

The reconstruction of long distance nerve injuries still represents a great challenge to surgeons who is engaged in peripheral nerve surgery. Here we used the functional nerve conduit (collagen scaffolds incorporated with neurocytokines CNTF and bFGF) to bridge a 35 mm long facial nerve gap in minipig models. At 6 months after surgery, electrophysiology assessment and histological examination were conducted to evaluate the regeneration of peripheral facial nerves. Based on functional and histological observations, the results indicated that the functional collagen scaffolds promoted nerve reconstruction. The number and arrangement of regenerated nerve fibers, myelination, and nerve function reconstruction was better in the CNTF + bFGF conduit group than the single factor CNTF or bFGF conduit group. The functional composite conduit, which exhibited favorable mechanical properties, may promote facial nerve regeneration in minipigs effectively.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of observer-based adaptive neural output-feedback control for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems with nonstrict-feedback structure. To overcome the design difficulty from the nonstrict-feedback structure, a variable separation approach is introduced by using the monotonically increasing property of system bounding functions. On the basis of the state observer, and by combining the adaptive backstepping technique with radial basis function neural networks' universal approximation capability, an adaptive neural output feedback control algorithm is presented. It is shown that the proposed controller can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded~in the sense of mean quartic value. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",

        "abstract": "The proposed competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism suggested that diverse RNA species, including protein-coding messenger RNAs and non-coding RNAs such as long non-coding RNAs, pseudogenes and circular RNAs could communicate with each other by competing for binding to shared microRNAs. The ceRNA network (ceRNET) is involved in tumor progression and has become a hot research topic in recent years. To date, more attention has been paid to the role of non-coding RNAs in ceRNA crosstalk. However, coding transcripts are more abundant and powerful than non-coding RNAs and make up the majority of miRNA targets. In this study, we constructed a mRNA-mRNA related ceRNET of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and identified the highlighted TWIST1-centered ceRNET, which recruits SLC12A5 and ZFHX4 as its ceRNAs. We found that TWIST1/SLC12A5/ZFHX4 are all upregulated in LUAD and are associated with poorer prognosis. SLC12A5 and ZFHX4 facilitated proliferation, migration, and invasion in vivo and in vitro, and their effects were reversed by miR-194-3p and miR-514a-3p, respectively. We further verified that SLC12A5 and ZFHX4 affected the function of TWIST1 by acting as ceRNAs. In summary, we constructed a mRNA-mRNA related ceRNET for LUAD and highlighted the well-known oncogene TWIST1. Then we verified that SLC12A5 and ZFHX4 exert their oncogenic function by regulating TWIST1 expression through a ceRNA mechanism.",

A model of evaluating disease severity of the cotton was established by analyzing the correlation between spectral indices of TM image and severity level (SL) of the disease. The results indicated that with an increase of disease SLs, the values of spectral indices B2, B4, SATVI, OSAVI, MSAVI, TSAVI, SVNSWI, SNSWIa, SNSWIb, SVNI, DNSIa, DNSIb, NDSWIa, NDSWIb, RNSWIa, RNSWIb, DVNI, EVI, TVI, SAVI, DVI, NDVI, RVI and PVI declined slowly, B1, B3, B7 and RI increased gradually, NDGI increased at first and then decreased, while B5 exhibited a trend of decrease-increase with an increase of disease SLs. The SLs of disease were highly significantly positive correlated with the spectral indices values of B1, B3 and RI, highly significantly negative correlated with the spectral indice values of B4, OSAVI, MSAVI, TSAVI, SVNSWI, SNSWIa, SNSWIb, SVNI, DNSIa, DNSIb, NDSWIa, NDSWIb, RNSWIa, RNSWIb, DVNI, EVI, TVI, NDGI, SAVI, DVI, NDVI, RVI and PVI, significantly negative correlated with the spectral indice values of SATVI, and no significantly correlated with the spectral indice values of B2, B5 and B7. All of the eight spectral indices of TM image selected achieved significant correlation level. However, the linear models on the basis of DVI and DNSIb had the best estimating precision. This study demonstrated that it is feasible to estimate quantitatively the SL of cotton disease using the spectral indices of TM satellite image.",

The main contribution is that an effective matrix decoupling technique is developed to derive a single-step LMI condition for observer-based H ∞ control design. This overcomes the drawback of two-step LMI approach in the literature. When restricted to delay-free fuzzy systems, the present result is shown less conservative than existing ones. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of our results.",

The second passage of SMCs (1×109 L-1) were seeded on collagen scaffold and co-cultured for 13 days. Afterwards, the second passage of ECs were seeded on the surface of collagen scaffold with SMCs and cultured for 2 days. 2 The -co-culture of canine SMCs and ECs on collagen scaffold was observed by H-E staining under scanning and transmission electron microscope. Results: H-E staining showed that SMCs grew well on the surface and interior of collagen scaffold. By the scanning electron microscope study, SMCs grew on the collagen scaffold and proliferated into multilayer cells during short time. The continuous monolayer of ECs was found on the surface of SMCs after 2 days co-culture. Conclusion: Tissue engineered arterial blood patch containing canine SMCs and ECs could be obtained via static short-time co-culture of two cells on collagen scaffold.",

The improved endurance and retention performances were achieved in the TiO 2-based memory device fabricated with an inserted ZnO layer. The mechanism of reliability improvement was discussed. The inserted ZnO layer is proposed to adjust the distribution of oxygen vacancies across the TiO 2 layer due to the lower formation energy of oxygen vacancy in ZnO, which may be responsible for the improved reliability characteristics in the TiO 2-based memory device with an inserted ZnO layer. © 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.",

However, knowledge about how the genome-wide expression of lncRNAs is developmentally regulated is still limited. We here performed a whole-genome identification of lncRNAs followed by a global expression profiling of these lncRNAs during development in Drosophila melanogaster. We combined bioinformatic prediction of lncRNAs with stringent filtering of protein-coding transcripts and experimental validation to define a high-confidence set of Drosophila lncRNAs. We identified 1,077 lncRNAs in the given transcriptomes that contain 43,967 transcripts; among these, 646 lncRNAs are novel. In vivo expression profiling of these lncRNAs in 27 developmental processes revealed that the expression of lncRNAs is highly temporally restricted relative to that of protein-coding genes. Remarkably, 21% and 42% lncRNAs were significantly upregulated at late embryonic and larval stage, the critical time for developmental transition. The results highlight the developmental specificity of lncRNA expression, and reflect the regulatory significance of a large subclass of lncRNAs for the onset of metamorphosis. The systematic annotation and expression analysis of lncRNAs during Drosophila development form the foundation for future functional exploration.",

In this study, the demineralized bone matrix (DBM) was activated with the engineering human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). To enhance the binding of BMP-2 to the DBM scaffolds, a collagen-binding peptide was fused to the N-terminal of BMP-2. The in vitro results showed that the engineered collagen-targeted BMP-2 (rhBMP2-v) bound to DBM scaffolds specifically and the rhBMP2-v had increased alkaline phosphatase activity in C2C12 cells. In vivo, the DBM scaffolds impregnated with rhBMP2-v showed greater effect on ectopic bone formation. Our data suggested that the collagen-based BMP-2 targeting bone repair system had greater bone inducing ability than DBM loaded with regular BMP-2.",

No preference for demographics or side presenting otitis media.Therapeutic surgery.Location and morphology of stapedius muscle and facial nerve.The stapedius muscle was encountered in 90.5% of axial (n = 181) and 87% of coronal sections (n = 174), and differences between sides and genders were not significant (p > 0.05). Five categories of anomalies or pathologic features were identified in axial layers, and 3 categories were identified in coronal layers. Two axial and 2 coronal CT planes were found to be especially significant in imaging the facial nerve and its morphology (p < 0.001), whereas axial planes were more apt to show stapedius muscle features. Other pathologic features were also observed significantly more from specific CT imaging planes.The presence the stapedius muscle and the morphology between the stapedius muscle and the facial nerve vary between different observation areas, and some CT planes provide more useful information than others. The imaging planes outlined in this study can be used to systematically and correctly identify certain facial nerve and stapedius muscle features and clarify unfamiliar pathologic anatomy in preoperative planning.",

Improving the properties of biomaterials and making them suitable for urethral reconstruction will be helpful. Previously, we constructed a fusion protein, collagen-binding VEGF (CBD-VEGF), which can bind to collagen scaffold, stimulate cell proliferation, and promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. We proposed that CBD-VEGF could improve the performance of collagen in reconstruction of extensive urethral defects. Our results showed that collagen scaffolds modified with CBD-VEGF could promote urethral tissue regeneration and improve the function of the neo-urethra in a beagle extensive urethral defect model. Thus, modifying biomaterials with bioactive factors provides an alternative strategy for the production of suitable biomaterials for urethral reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "【Objective】 Based on the Landsat-5 cell level, analyzing the factors affecting the estimating veracity, exploring vegetation indexes to clear up the space information difference of the non-cotton background, ascertaining the optimal time to monitoring the existing cotton-seedling density, as a result, the information would be provided for the cotton yield estimation and zones management. 【Method】 Sixty group sample data, consisting of the existing cotton-seedling density, longitude/latitude, sowing time, emergence time, were obtained through investigating the thirteen fields (630 hm2), and three sample dot data in every sample area were averaged. EVI and DEVI were picked up from the images of five times from sowing time to full-flowering. And then sixty group sample data were divided into two equal parts to establish and text models. The linear models were established bydata of the middle sowing time and the all three sowing times on the basis of EVI and DEVI, respectively, and the model veracity was tested by RMSE and REPE. At last, the existing cotton-seedling density at the country scale was retrieved by the best model.【Result】 The analysis results showed that the difference of seedling size caused by the different emergence times debased the estimation veracity; and as the sample of the different sowing times, the testing result of the middle sowing time models showed that the absolute error of the existing cotton-seedling number of each hectare on 9 June and 25 June was 2.05×104 plants/hm2 and 2.08×104 plants/hm2, respectively, the absolute error under the three sowing times was 2.80×104 plants/hm2 and 2.53×104 plants/hm2 respectively. DEVI Compared with EVI on 24 May cleared up the effect of the space difference of the non-cotton background to some extent, and then the estimation time advanced from 9 June to 24 May. Giving attention to veracity and time of models, the optimal time monitoring the existing cotton-seedling density was from budding to full-flowering. As an example, I function on 9 June was used to monitor the existing cotton-seedling density in the 148th farm of Xinjiang Construction Crops, the result could exhibit the distributing proportion and space characteristics rightly. 【Conclusion】 The result showed that emergence time and the space background difference are the main factors affecting the estimation veracity of the existing cotton-seedling density, and the models based on different sowing times could improve the estimation level, and DEVI could make the monitoring time in advance, and the optimal time for estimating the existing cotton-seedling density was from budding to full-flowering, and the demonstration indicated that the research result was feasible.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell-based therapy has been a promising method for tissue regeneration and wound repair. Adult adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) are often used for adipose and bone tissue reconstruction because of their abundant sources and multipotential differentiation ability. When combined with carriers, ADSCs could be useful for constructing tissue substitutes in vitro or facilitating tissue regeneration in vivo. Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has been used for tissue reconstruction because collagen presents good cell compatibility. However, DBM degrades rapidly when used for three-dimensional ADSC culture. Here DBM was crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide to investigate whether crosslinked DBM (CRL-DBM) could be used as ADSC carrier. CRL-DBM showed not only improved mechanical property and enhanced stability, but also sustained ADSC proliferation and effective differentiation into adipocytes and bone lineage cells. The results indicated that CRL-DBM may be a suitable ADSC carrier for adipose and bone tissue regeneration.",

The structure was characterized by gel permeation chromatography, ¹H-NMR, Fourier transform infrared, and DSC analyses. Mechanical property testing showed that their tensile strength rose with increasing the hard segment content with a maximum tensile strength of 34.43 ± 1.73 MPa. The average mass loss for the hydrolytic degradation was only about 13 % in 56 days while this value for the enzymatic degradation was around 95 % in 30 days. The morphological and biomechanical characters of the tubular scaffolds electrospun from the as-prepared PUs were also examined. As the solution concentration was varied from 10 to 18% (w/v), the fiber diameter was progressively increased, and the scaffold tensile strength was enhanced from 2.82 ± 0.16 MPa to 7.07 ± 0.44 MPa, the suture retention strength from 2.48 ± 0.33 to 8.38 ± 0.35 N, and the burst pressure strength from 72 ± 2 to 172 ± 2 kPa, all higher than those of native blood vessels. At the same time, the L-929 mouse fibroblasts (L-929) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used in cytotoxicity and cell-adhesion evaluations toward the electrospun scaffolds. The level of toxicity is less than level 1, and cells were found to attach well to and remain viable on the scaffolds.",

With carefully selected components, the absorption band of the ring-closed photochromic diarylethene well overlapped with the emission band of the rhodamine B. The fluorescence emission intensity of rhodamine B is easily modulated with the photoisomerization of diarylethene by controlling the exposure time both in solution and in a solid medium. The photoswitchable system displayed high fluorescence quenching efficiency (>90%) and remarkable fatigue resistance in both solution and a solid medium.

The bromopyridine was connected directly to the central perfluorocyclopentene ring to participate in photoisomerization reaction. The two diarylethenes exhibited favorable photochromism and function as notable fluorescence switches in solution. The absorption maxima of their closed-ring isomers shifted dramatically to shorter wavelengths with notable color change from red to yellow upon the stimulation of trifluoroacetic acid. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recurrent gene mutations and fusions were tested in an additional 87 adult and 93 pediatric patients. Among the 29 newly identified in-frame gene fusions, those involving MEF2D and ZNF384 were clinically relevant and were demonstrated to perturb B-cell differentiation, with EP300-ZNF384 inducing leukemia in mice. Eight gene expression subgroups associated with characteristic genetic abnormalities were identified, including leukemia with MEF2D and ZNF384 fusions in two distinct clusters. In subgroup G4 which was characterized by ERG deletion, DUX4-IGH fusion was detected in most cases. This comprehensive dataset allowed us to compare the features of molecular pathogenesis between adult and pediatric B-ALL and to identify signatures possibly related to the inferior outcome of adults to that of children. We found that, besides the known discrepancies in frequencies of prognostic markers, adult patients had more cooperative mutations and greater enrichment for alterations of epigenetic modifiers and genes linked to B-cell development, suggesting difference in the target cells of transformation between adult and pediatric patients and may explain in part the disparity in their responses to treatment.

The effects of longer period serum starvation are not clear while similar starvation might occur in vitro maintained cells (i.e. tissue engineering products) and in vivo such as ischemia of human tissues or organs. We found human dermis fibroblasts were transformed for about 70 days caused by serum starvation (0.5% serum). The transformed cells became round and had more than one nucleolus. In 0.5% serum medium they kept almost constant growth rate as the normal fibroblasts in 10% serum medium. Abnormal karyotype including aneuploidy and structural aberrations was observed. The transformed cells had high telomerase activities, in contrast, normal fibroblasts had no detectable telomerase activities. C-myc was up-regulated while cdk2, cyclin A, p21 were down in transformed cells. Cell transplantation into SCID nude mice confirmed that the cells had the capacity of forming solid tumors. The results indicated that long-term serum starvation could lead to cell chromosomal instability and transformation.",

Its application for structural components was limited due to inadequate strength. The present study aims to develop a class of structural grade EPS concrete by replacing Portland cement with magnesia phosphate cement (MPC). The resulting MPC–EPS concrete had a density ranging from 750 to 1,800 kg/m3. Extensive laboratory tests were performed to characterize the strength, drying shrinkage and water absorption properties of the MPC–EPS concrete. The test results showed that the MPC–EPS concrete had a higher early-age strength than the typical EPS concrete, and the rate of strength gain increased with increasing EPS contents. The drying shrinkage potential and water absorption of the MPC–EPS concrete were much lower than those of the typical EPS concrete, indicating that the MPC–EPS concrete could be a building material with high thermal-resistance and good durability.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of observer-based H\"~ fuzzy control design for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with time-delay. The main contribution is that an effective matrix decoupling technique is developed to derive a single-step LMI condition for observer-based H\"~ control design. This overcomes the drawback of two-step LMI approach in the literature. When restricted to delay-free fuzzy systems, the present result is shown less conservative than existing ones. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of our results.",

        "abstract": "Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard) is native to South America but has expanded its range and invaded many regions of the world, primarily on flowers and to a lesser extent on horticultural product shipments. As a result of initial invasion into an area, damage caused is usually significant but not necessarily sustained. Currently, it is an economic pest in selected native and invaded regions of the world. Adults cause damage by puncturing abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces for feeding and egg laying sites. Larvae mine the leaf parenchyma tissues which can lead to leaves drying and wilting. We have recorded 365 host plant species from 49 families and more than 106 parasitoid species. In a subset of the Argentinian data, we found that parasitoid community composition attacking L. huidobrensis differs significantly in cultivated and uncultivated plants. No such effect was found at the world level, probably due to differences in collection methods in the different references. We review the existing knowledge as a means of setting the context for new and unpublished data. The main objective is to provide an update of widely dispersed and until now unpublished data, evaluate dispersion of the leafminer and management strategies in different regions of the world, and highlight the need to consider the possible effects of climate change on further regional invasions or expansions.",

Effect of WSA on setting time, mechanical properties, alkali silica reaction (ASR) ,hydration process and microstructure of cement pastes and concrete was studied. Compressive and flexural strength of concrete mixture containing 14% WSA was 7.5% and 19.5% more as compared to control mixture at 28 days respectively. ASR expansion of mortar prisms and hydration temperature was reduced due to WSA incorporation. XRD and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) investigations of CP indicated that WSA improved the microstructure of CP and was effective in imparting the pozzolanic characteristics during hydration reaction at 7 and 28 days.",

        "abstract": "Human p12CDK2AP1 protein is encoded by the cyclin‑dependent kinase 2‑associated protein 1 (CDK2AP1) gene. This protein suppresses cell growth, differentiation and angiogenesis in numerous types of carcinoma by interacting with certain cell cycle proteins, including CDK2 and DNA polymerase α/primase. p12CDK2AP1 exerts its functions predominantly through protein‑protein interactions. Therefore, the identification of other p12CDK2AP1‑interacting proteins may clarify its role in cell cycle regulation and carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify additional p12CDK2AP1‑interacting proteins. A novel unnamed protein product (UPP, BC006130) was identified through using a yeast two‑hybrid system. The interaction of p12CDK2AP1 with the UPP was further verified by glutathione S-transferase pull‑down and co‑immunoprecipitation experiments in vitro. The qPCR results following overexpression and siRNA assays demonstrated that the expression levels of the UPP were mediated by the CDK2AP1 gene. Furthermore, overexpression of the UPP gene was shown to shorten the length of the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in normal and tumor cell lines in a flow cytometry assay. The results of human tumor xenografts experiments in Balb/c nude mice indicated that stable transfection with the UPP gene was able to inhibit tumor cell proliferation in vivo. Overall, this study identified and characterized a novel interactive protein of p12CDK2AP1, which may inhibit cell proliferation by mediating the cell cycle. It expands the understanding of the mechanisms of p12CDK2AP1 and its potential as a cancer therapeutic target.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between methods of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzyme multiplied immunoassay technology (EMIT) for determination of total mycophenolic acid (tMPA) and free (fMPA) concentration and to study pharmacokinetics of fMPA in Chinese liver transplant recipients. An HPLC method with fluorometric detection and an EMIT assay were established to determine fMPA in plasma ultrafiltrates. Pharmacokinetic parameters of tMPA and fMPA in 51 patients were estimated. The calibration range of fMPA was 0.0025 to 1.0 μg/mL for the HPLC method and 0.0050 to 0.50 μg/mL for the EMIT method. Mean recovery of the two methods was 98.0% and 97.1%, respectively. The intraday and interday coefficient of variations were 0.93% to 3.1% and 1.6% to 2.9% for HPLC and 4.51% to 15.8% and 5.83% to 19.5% for EMIT, respectively. The relationship of the two methods was EMIT = 1.074 × HPLC + 0.582 (r2 = 0.918, n = 470, P < 0.05) for tMPA and EMIT = 1.068 × HPLC + 0.004 (r2 = 0.945, n = 297, P < 0.05) for fMPA. There was a positive mean bias of EMIT for tMPA (27.0%) and fMPA (23.3%). The AUC0-12 of tMPA and fMPA obtained by HPLC in 51 patients was 34.7 ± 11.1 and 0.72 ± 0.38 μg·h/mL, respectively. The free fraction of MPA was 1.60 ± 1.21% (Median:1.36%, interquartile: 0.72, 2.22), [corrected] which was significantly correlated with 7-O-glucuronide conjugate of MPA AUC0-12 (r2 = 0.705, P < 0.001), albumin (r2 = -0.529, P < 0.001), and the clearance of creatinine (r2 = -0.417, r2 = 0.005). Both HPLC and EMIT assay are suitable for the determination of fMPA. A considerable interindividual variability exists in pharmacokinetics of fMPA among Chinese liver transplant recipients. 7-O-Glucuronide conjugate of MPA and albumin concentrations are two factors correlated to fMPA variance.",

Automated sequencing revealed that the exon 8 of kitl gene was deleted in homozygous mice and the deletion also caused a frameshift. Direct sequencing of the kitl genomic DNA in the homozygous mutants showed a GT to GC change at the splicing donor site of the intron 8. This mutation interfered with normal splicing and caused the skipping of exon 8 in mutant mice.",

MSCs are generally cultured on two-dimensional (2D) substrate in vitro. There are indications that they may simultaneously lose their stemness and multipotentiality as the result of prolonged 2D culture. In this study, we used three-dimensional (3D) collagen scaffolds as rat MSCs carrier and compared the properties of MSCs on 3D collagen scaffolds with monolayer cultured MSCs. The results demonstrated that collagen scaffolds were suitable for rat MSCs adherence and proliferation. More importantly, compared to MSCs under 2D culture, 3D MSCs significantly maintained higher expression levels of stemness genes (Oct4, Sox2, Rex-1 and Nanog), yielded high frequencies of colony-forming units-fibroblastic (CFU-F) and showed enhanced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation efficiency upon induction. Thus, 3D collagen scaffolds may be beneficial for expanding rat MSCs while maintaining the stem cell properties in vitro.",

        "abstract": "Endothelial cells play a critical role in the process of angiogenesis during skin wound healing. The migration and proliferation of endothelial cells are processes that are initiated by the hypoxic microenvironment in a wound, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a novel role for microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) in angiogenesis. We firstly demonstrated that MAP4 phosphorylation was induced in hypoxic endothelial cells; the increase in MAP4 phosphorylation enhanced the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. We also found that hypoxia (2% O) activated p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and we identified p38/MAPK as an upstream regulator of MAP4 phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Moreover, we showed that the promigration and proproliferation effects of MAP4 phosphorylation were attributed to its role in microtubule dynamics. These results indicated that MAP4 phosphorylation induced by p38/MAPK signaling promotes angiogenesis by inducing the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells cultured under hypoxic conditions via microtubule dynamics regulation. These findings provide new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the initiation of the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the finite-time stabilization of a class of stochastic nonlinear systems. Different from functions which are necessarily known in the conventional finite-time control of nonlinear systems, the nonlinear functions can be completely unknown in this paper. By applying fuzzy-logic systems to approximate the unknown nonlinearities, a novel adaptive finite-time control strategy is proposed. However, due to the existence of approximation errors, the existing finite-time stability criterion cannot be used to analyze the stability of stochastic nonlinear systems. To deal with this difficulty, a finite-time stability criterion, by utilizing the mean value theorem of integrals, is first established in Lemma 5, which plays a significant role in the finite-time stability analysis of stochastic nonlinear systems. Then, the finite-time mean square stability of a stochastic nonlinear system is proved by combining Lemma 3 with Jensen's inequality.",

        "abstract": "The spectrum and physical-chemical parameters were measured on cotton leaves infected by aphid with different severity levels (SL) at main cotton growth periods. Meanwhile, the reflectance and physical-chemical parameters of cotton leaves infected by aphid were analyzed and compared in different cotton growth periods and varieties. The sensitivity wave bands of cotton leaves infected by aphid were confirmed, and the estimating models of leaves infected by aphid were established. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the spectrum and physical-chemical parameters of cotton leaves infected by aphid. The thickness, water and Chl. b increased, while Chla, Chl. a+b and Cars content decreased in leaves infected by aphid. Besides, in visible region, the reflectance of cotton leaves infected by aphid has shown going up first and then down in different cotton growth periods and varieties with increasing of SL. However, in NIR region, it has shown discrepancy in varieties. The 434-727 and 648 nm can be used as sensitive and optimal aphid-band for cotton leaves. Estimation models for leaves infected by aphid were all in significant correlation. Among all the models, the model of (R1 589-R648)/ (R1 589+R648) had the best estimation precision, RE was the smallest (0.128), and it was commended as best models to estimate SL of leaves infected by aphid. The study provides an experimental reference for monitoring spectrum of cotton infected by aphid with remote sensing in large areas.",

CAP and SIR were applied in the evaluation of verbal communication skills. IBM SPSS Statistics 19 was used in statistical analysis.The average score of CAP was 6.13, and statistical analysis showed CAP score was not significantly correlated with the duration of hearing loss, the postoperative time or the time of wearing a hearing aid preoperatively. The average SIR score of all these post-lingual patients was 4.91.It showed that CAP score was not significantly correlated with these three factors. This may due to the low accuracy of CAP or the small sample size in the present study. SIR was not suitable for the evaluation of post-lingual cochlear implantees.",

        "abstract": "Although plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) is a promising biomarker of Fabry disease (FD), few studies have assessed the impact of lyso-Gb3 in patients with FD. A total of 38 patients diagnosed with FD at Ruijin Hospital between January 2012 and December 2014 were recruited in the current study. An additional 120 unrelated healthy individuals were selected as healthy controls. A simplified liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was performed to determine lyso-Gb3 levels in plasma. Protein precipitation and glycolipid extraction were conducted using acetone/methanol. Clinical performance, including diagnostic value and disease surveillance, were compared between plasma lyso-Gb3 levels and α-galactosidase A (α-gal A) enzyme activity. The overall coefficient of variation values between inter- and intra-days varied between 2.8 and 18.9% and linearity correlation coefficients were ≥0.99 for all assays. Therefore, the effectiveness of the LC-MS/MS method was validated. Furthermore, a cut-off value of 0.81 ng/ml plasma lyso-Gb3 was able to separate patients with FD from healthy individuals. The sensitivity of this cut-off was 94.7% and the specificity was 100%. Compared with α-gal A enzyme activity, the diagnostic rate of patients assessed using plasma lyso-Gb3 levels was similar; however, there was a tighter correlation between plasma lyso-Gb3 levels and the mainz severity score index score in male patients (r=0.711 vs. r=-0.687). The sensitivity of plasma lyso-Gb3 in diagnosing female patients with FD was higher than α-gal A enzyme activity (82.4 vs. 23.5%). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report the effectiveness of plasma lyso-Gb3 levels in diagnosing Chinese patients with FD. Using α-gal A activity as a reference, the results of current study indicated that plasma lyso-Gb3 levels are more useful at diagnosing female patients with FD. Furthermore, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels are more suitable at determining overall disease severity in male patients.",

Furthermore, based on fuzzy approximation and backstepping techniques, a state feedback adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is proposed, which guarantees that all of the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, while the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin.

        "abstract": "Nerve conduit provides a promising strategy for nerve regeneration, and the proper microenvironment in the lumen could improve the regeneration. Our previous work had demonstrated that linear ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) could effectively guide the oriented growth of axons. Laminin is known as an important nerve growth promoting factor and can facilitate the growth cone formation. In addition, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can effectively improve the nerve regeneration after nerve injuries. However, in practice, diffusion caused by the body fluids is the major obstacle in their applications. To retain CNTF or BDNF on the scaffolds, we produced collagen binding CNTF (CBD-CNTF), collagen binding BDNF (CBD-BDNF) and laminin binding CNTF (LBD-CNTF), laminin binding BDNF (LBD-BDNF) respectively. In this work, we developed laminin modified LOCS fibers (L × LOCS) by chemical cross-linking LOCS fibers with laminin. Collagen binding or laminin binding neurotrophic factors were combined with LOCS or L × LOCS, and then filled them into the collagen nerve conduit. They were found to guide the ordered growth of axons, and improve the nerve functional recovery in the rat facial nerve transection model. The combination of CNTF and BDNF greatly enhanced the facial nerve regeneration and functional recovery.",

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the packaged unknown nonlinearities, and then a novel direct adaptive controller is constructed via backstepping technique. The proposed controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood around the origin in the sense of mean quartic value. The main advantages lie in that the proposed controller is simpler and only one adaptive parameter need to be updated online. Simulation example further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "To explore the middle-term outcome of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells transplantation in the treatment of lower limb ischemia.From March 2003 to June 2005, 65 patients with lower limb ischemia were treated by autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells transplantation. Of the patients, there were 50 males and 15 females, with a mean age of 66.5 years (range 36-89 years), including 4 cases of simple arteriosclerotic occlusion, 5 cases of thromboangiitis obliterans and 56 cases diabetic lower limb ischemia. A total of 400 mL bone-marrow blood were extracted from the posterior superior iliac crest. And then the mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone-marrow blood in the laboratory. The amount of transplantation bone marrow mononuclear cells was (0.60-1.80) x 10(9) (mean 1.05 x 10(9)). Twelve patients received cell transplantation from two to four times and the other patients one time. According to the improvement of clinical finding, the outcome was evaluated.All the patients were followed up for 8-56 months (mean 21.5 months). There were 8 deaths, and the mortality was 12.3%; 5 were due to myocardial infarction and heart failure and 3 were due to cerebral infarction. The general effective rate was 70.8% (46/65) and the recurrent rate was 10.7% (7/65). Of them, the response to treatment lasted over 12 months in 42 cases, accounting for 91.3% (42/46); over 24 months in 24 cases, accounting for 52.2% (24/46); and over 37 months in 12 cases, accounting for 26.1% (12/46). The effective rates were 100% in 12 patients who received 2-4 times transplantation and 64.2% in 53 patients who received 1 time transplantation, showing statistically significant difference between them (P < 0.001).The middle-term outcome of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells transplantation show that it is a feasible and simple method for treatment of lower limb ischemia.",

        "abstract": "Background Optimization of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of busulfan, an essential component of conditioning regimens, improves the outcomes in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Traditional sampling methods for calculating AUC require multiple sampling. Objective To establish a limited sampling strategy for predicting the AUC of intravenous busulfan for Chinese adult patients prior to HSCT. Methods The pharmacokinetics of twice-daily intravenous busulfan was studied in forty-five Chinese adult patients. Limited sampling models were established by the multiple linear regression analysis. The prediction error (PE) and the absolute prediction error (APE) were calculated to evaluate predictive accuracy. The agreement between the predicted and actual AUC was investigated by the Bland-Altman analysis. The accuracy and robustness of the models was validated by the bootstrap analysis. Results The AUC values of the 1st and 7th doses of busulfan were 1491 ± 403.7 and 1908 ± 518.5 μmol L min, respectively. The 2-sample model suggested that the predicted AUC of twice-daily intravenous busulfan could be calculated using the following equation: AUC = 40.017 + 0.955 × C + 1.088 × C with r = 0.919. The mean PE and APE of the model were 0.52 ± 7.67 and 6.32 ± 4.27%, respectively. Conclusion The 2-sample model is an effective and reliable approach to predict the AUC of twice-daily intravenous busulfan in Chinese adult patients.",

Here, a peptide of seven amino acids was firstly utilized to engineer PDGF-BB to construct a collagen-targeting system. This peptide functioned as collagen-binding domain (CBD) to specially target the PDGF-BB to the collagen and restrict its diffusion. In our study, in vitro activity assay showed that the CBD-fused PDGF (CBD-PDGF) and native PDGF (NAT-PDGF) possessed similar activity to stimulate the human fibroblast proliferation. As expected, this peptide promoted the binding of PDGF to collagen scaffolds, and CBD-PDGF caused more cells to proliferate on the collagen gel than NAT-PDGF when the same amounts of PDGF were added. In the in vivo experiment, CBD-PDGF-loaded collagen scaffolds were uniformly cellularized and vascularized compared to that of NAT-PDGF-loaded scaffolds. Our study demonstrated that the CBD targeted PDGF to the collagen scaffold to exert its functions, and it suggested this could be an effective system for targeting tissue regeneration and wound repair.",

We show that inactivation of the secA2 gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which encodes a component of a virulence-associated protein secretion system, enhanced the apoptosis of infected macrophages by diminishing secretion of mycobacterial superoxide dismutase. Deletion of secA2 markedly increased priming of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in vivo, and vaccination of mice and guinea pigs with a secA2 mutant significantly increased resistance to M. tuberculosis challenge compared with standard M. bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination. Our results define a mechanism for a key immune evasion strategy of M. tuberculosis and provide what we believe to be a novel approach for improving mycobacterial vaccines.",

However, their efficacy is limited as the majority of cells die post-transplantation. In this study, collagen sponges were utilized as carriers for NS/PCs. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a mitogen for NS/PCs, was incorporated into the collagen sponges to stimulate NS/PC proliferation. However, the effect of native bFGF is limited because it diffuses into the culture medium and is lost following medium exchange. To overcome this problem, a collagen-binding polypeptide domain, which has high affinity to collagen, was fused with bFGF to sustain the exposure of NS/PCs within the collagen sponges to bFGF. The results indicated that the number of NS/PCs was significantly higher in collagen sponges incorporating engineered bFGF than in those with native bFGF or the PBS control after 7 days in culture. Here, we designed a natural biological neural scaffold consisting of collagen sponges, engineered bFGF, and NS/PCs. In addition to the effect of proliferated NS/PCs, the engineered bFGF retained in the natural biological neural scaffolds could have a direct effect on nervous system reconstruction. The two aspects of the natural biological neural scaffolds may produce synergistic effects, and so they represent a promising candidate for nervous system repair.",

        "abstract": "CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) have been identified as an important type of effector and regulatory T cell, but their roles in the chronic infectious diseases caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae remain poorly defined. Here, we studied circulating human iNKT cells in blood samples from tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy patients. We found that the percentages of iNKT cells among total circulating T cells in TB and leprosy patients were not significantly different from those in normal controls. However, both TB and leprosy patients showed a selective reduction of the proinflammatory CD4 − CD8β − (DN) iNKT cells with a proportionate increase in the CD4 + iNKT cells. Similar phenotypic alterations in circulating iNKT cells were observed in a mouse model of M. tuberculosis infection. Taken together, these findings indicate that the selective reduction of circulating DN iNKT cells is associated with chronic infections caused by M. tuberculosis and M. leprae .",

Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, a state-feedback adaptive controller is constructed by backstepping. The proposed adaptive controller guarantees that the system output converges into a small neighborhood of the reference signal, and all the signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded. Compared with the results that exist, the main advantage of the proposed method is that the controller design is independent of the choice of the fuzzy-membership functions; therefore, a priori knowledge of fuzzy approximators is not necessary for control design, and the proposed approach requires only one adaptive law for an nth-order system. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Several strategies to promote axon regeneration at the injury site have been tested, but the progress is very limited. One of the major reasons is that the regenerated axons often extend randomly and do not reach the proper place. Fabricating linearly ordered materials as nerve guidance would be important to solve such problems. In this study, a novel type of nerve guidance material was prepared from the bovine aponeurosis, which mainly consisted of ordered collagen fibers. The processed material showed good cell compatibility and low immunogenisity. Moreover, the processed material guided the neurites outgrowth of in vitro cultured cortical neurons along its fibers. The results suggested that the processed aponeurosis would be a proper nerve guidance biomaterial for SCI repair.",

        "abstract": "Skin injuries caused by burns or radiation remain a serious concern in terms of clinical therapy. Because of the damage to the epidermis or dermis, angiogenesis is needed to repair the skin. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most effective factors for promoting angiogenesis and preventing injury progression, but the delivery of VEGF to lesion sites is limited by the skin barrier. Recently, gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-mediated drug delivery into or through the epidermis and dermis has attracted much attention. However, the efficacy of the AuNP-mediated transdermal drug delivery remains unknown. In this study, gold nanoparticles were conjugated with VEGF and generated a surface by carrying negative charges, showing an ideal transdermal delivery efficacy for VEGF in wound repair. Our findings may provide new avenues for the treatment of cutaneous injuries.",

        "abstract": "In many civil engineering constructions, soft clayey soils are often stabilized with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) whose production process is energy intensive and emits a large quantity of CO2. In this paper, an OPC-based clay stabilizer (CSCN) which contains some eco-friendly materials is studied to compare with OPC by investigating the mechanical properties of the stabilized clays. Microstructural and mineralogical studies using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are performed to reveal the mechanisms controlling the development of the strength and modulus. The test results indicate that the compressive strength and secant modulus increase with increasing the content of CSCN and curing age. To achieve the equivalent improvement of the strength and modulus, much less CSCN is needed relative to OPC, which illustrates that CSCN can be a more effective and relatively eco-friendly clay stabilizer. The analysis on pH values and moisture consumption indicates that the hydration and pozzolanic reactions in CSCN-stabilized clays may be quicker than those in OPC-stabilized clays. The microstructural analyses confirm the formation of C-S-H gels in stabilized clays and the types of C-S-H gels are dependent upon the Ca/Si molar ratio according to EDX results. The types and amounts of new minerals in stabilized clays are the possible mechanisms controlling the enhancement of mechanical properties.",

        "abstract": "Sperm storage in vivo extends the time window for fertilisation in several animal species, from a few days to several years. The underlying storage mechanisms, however, are largely unknown. In this study, spermatozoa from the epididymis and oviduct of Chinese soft-shelled turtles were investigated to identify potentially relevant morphological features and transformations at different stages of sperm storage. Large cytoplasmic droplets (CDs) containing lipid droplets (LDs) were attached to the midpiece of most spermatozoa in the epididymis, without migrating down the sperm tail. However, they were absent from the oviductal spermatozoa, suggesting that CDs with LDs may be a source of endogenous energy for epididymal spermatozoa. The onion-like mitochondria recovered their double-membrane morphology, with typical cristae, within the oviduct at a later stage of storage, thus implying that mitochondrial metabolism undergoes alterations during storage. Furthermore, a well developed fibrous sheath on the long principal piece was the integrating ultrastructure for glycolytic enzymes and substrates. These novel morphological characteristics may allow turtle spermatozoa to use diverse energy metabolism pathways at different stages of storage.",

        "abstract": "To identify the existence and composition of the blood-spleen barrier (BSB) in chickens, the microanatomical features of the spleen were investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy, intravenous injection of ink, acid phosphatase reaction, and silver impregnation. The results showed that the white pulp in chicken spleen consists of lymphoid nodules, periarteriolar lymphatic sheaths (PALS) and periellipsoidal lymphatic sheaths (PELS). There was no evidence for the presence of a marginal zone. The splenic ellipsoid was a unique structure, which functioned as a barrier for filtering and phagocytosis. Uptake of carbon particles was limited to the ellipsoid and PELS, 60 min after injection of carbon particles. Reticular fibres were densely distributed in the ellipsoid and extended into the PELS. Ellipsoid-associated cells (EACs), reticular cells and macrophages were acid phosphatase positive. The sheathed capillaries, surrounded by the ellipsoid, were similar to high endothelial venules (HEVs). These findings suggest that the BSB of chickens is present in the ellipsoid and PELS, protecting the spleen from invasion from circulating pathogens. The BSB was a reticular framework, between the arterial and venous vessels, which included cuboidal-shaped endothelial cells, supporting cells, EACs, macrophages, reticular cells and fibres. Lymphocyte migration into the spleen parenchyma is most likely via the HEV-like vessels. These research findings contribute to better understanding of avian immunology and provide an insight into evolutionary differences in the immune system.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of adaptive neural control of stochastic nonlinear systems in nonstrict-feedback form with unknown backlash-like hysteresis nonlinearities. To overcome the design difficulty of nonstrict-feedback structure, variable separation technique is used to decompose the unknown functions of all state variables into a sum of smooth functions of each error dynamic. By combining radial basis function neural networks' universal approximation capability with an adaptive backstepping technique, an adaptive neural control algorithm is proposed. It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are four-moment semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error eventually converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in the sense of mean quartic value. Simulation results further show the effectiveness of the presented control scheme.",

There was no perioperative mortality or any permanent neurological deficit in either group. The overall perioperative complication rate was 6.1% in the stent group vs. 9.6% in the bypass group (p=0.295). The 10-year target vessel revascularization rate was 46.6% for stenting vs. 5.8% for bypass (p<0.001). The cumulative primary patency rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 91%, 78%, 67%, and 49% for the stent group vs. 99%, 97%, 95%, and 89% for the bypass group (p<0.001). The cumulative secondary patency rates were 95%, 91%, 86%, and 64%, respectively, for the stent group vs. 99%, 99%, 98%, and 94% for the bypass group (p=0.001). No difference was detected in overall survival curves between the groups (p=0.527).Both endovascular stenting and extrathoracic surgical bypass are safe and effective treatments for subclavian steal syndrome in the short and medium term; however, extrathoracic surgical bypasses are more durable in the long term.",

        "abstract": "Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have become the key gene regulators and prognostic biomarkers in various cancers. Through microarray data, Linc00339 was identified as a candidate oncogenic lncRNA. We compared the expression levels of Linc00339 in several breast cancer cell lines and normal mammary gland epithelial cell line. The effects of Linc00339 on tumor progression were examined both in vitro and in vivo. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were applied to evaluate the functions of Linc00339, miR-377-3p, and HOXC6 on cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis was used to detect apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and molecular taxonomy of breast cancer international consortium (METABRIC). Dual luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation were performed to confirm the interaction between Linc003339 and miR-377-3p. Linc00339 was increased in breast cancer cell lines compared with the normal epithelial cell. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, Linc00339 overexpression promoted triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) proliferation, inhibited cell cycle arrest, and suppressed apoptosis. Silencing of Linc00339 obtained the opposite effects. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that Linc00339 could sponge miR-377-3p and regulate its expression. Higher expression of miR-377-3p indicated longer OS in breast cancer patients, especially in TNBC patients. Overexpression of miR-377-3p retarded TNBC cell growth through regulating cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. And miR-377-3p was involved in Linc00339-mediated TNBC proliferation through regulating HOXC6 expression. Knockdown of HOXC6 inhibited TNBC progression. In conclusion, our results illuminated that the novel Linc00339/miR-377-3p/HOXC6 axis played a critical role in TNBC progression and might be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.",

However, the lack of effective delivery and the efficient targeting specificity limits its clinical applications. Here, heparin possessing PDGF binding domain was crosslinked to the collagen-based demineralized bone matrix (DBM) for the delivery of human PDGF(HC-PDGF). In in vitro experiments, heparin improves the binding of PDGF to collagen. In vitro activity assay indicates that collagen-heparin-PDGF (CH-PDGF) promotes human fibroblasts to proliferate on collagen gel. In addition, HC-PDGF stimulates cells to migrate into DBM scaffolds after implantation. The histological analysis shows that HC-PDGF promotes vascularization of the implants. In summary, heparin-DBM/PDGF could prevent the diffusion of PDGF, prolong its activity, and promote the cellularization and vascularization of the scaffold.",

A pair of primers which included two restriction sites was designed based on the published pneumolysin gene sequence. The pneumolysin gene was amplified from pneumococcal DNA with PCR technology. The restriction enzyme digested fragment was linked into the cloning vector PET-28a and the recombinant plasmid DNA containing pneumolysin was then transfected into host cell E. coli JM109 (DE3).DNA fragments were subcloned to construct the complete pneumolysin gene by a conventional coning and PCR. The inserted pneumolysin gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing and the pneumolysin protein was successfully expressed. The relative molecular mass of the expressed product was 52 000. The expressed product amounted to 8% of the total host cell protein.The pneumolysin gene was successfully cloned into host cell using genetic engineering technology. The recombinant pneumolysin was expressed and purified for preparation. This work laid a foundation of the preparation of pneumococcal conjugative vaccines.",

We developed new methods based on amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) to detect these polymorphisms. Tetra-primers amplification in a single tube was established to detect C1236T and C3435T polymorphism. For G2677T/A polymorphism, a two-step allele-specific amplification method was used. MDR1 genotypes of 177 Chinese subjects were determined by the methods we established. The methods we established were verified with gene sequencing. Gene frequencies of 1236C and 1236T were 37.8 and 62.2%, respectively; gene frequencies of 2677G, 2677T and 2677A were 44.1, 38.4 and 17.5%, respectively; the gene frequencies of 3435C and 3435T were 65.0 and 35.0%, respectively. The results were similar with other studies on Oriental subjects. The methods we established are simple, accurate, and economical, and can provide reliable approaches for determining MDR1 polymorphism.",

        "abstract": "HfO x based resistive switching devices with thin AlO x layer inserted between HfO x and TiN top electrode (TE) and Pt bottom electrode (BE) were fabricated respectively. Both devices show robust bipolar resistive switching phenomenon. Experimental result reveals that TiN/AlO x /HfO x /Pt device with appropriately thick HfO x film shows significant enhancement in performance as compared with other samples, having lower voltage and excellent uniformity. The role of inserted AlO x layer and thickness of HfO x film on resistive switching properties are discussed and clarified through comparative experiments, which is considered to be a doping effect. The experimental result is consistent with the model where resistive switching happens near TiN top electrode (TE) due to partial rupture and reconstruction of conducting filaments (CFs) assisted by the doping. The different doping profiles near top electrode of the samples were confirmed by XPS depth analysis. This work provides detailed information about the optimization of HfO x based resistive switching device by a doping profile modification approach.",

Our previous work has demonstrated that the native human PDGF-BB was added a collagen-binding domain (CBD), TKKTLRT, to develop a collagen-based PDGF targeting delivery system. Here, we showed that this CBD-fused PDGF-BB (CBD-PDGF) could bind to collagen membrane efficiently. We used the rabbit dermal ischemic ulcer model to study the effects of CBD-PDGF loaded on collagen membranes. Results revealed that this system maintained a higher concentration and stronger bioactivity of PDGF-BB on the collagen membranes and promoted the re-epithelialization of dermal ulcer wounds, the collagen deposition, and the formation of capillary lumens within the newly formed tissue area. It demonstrated that collagen membranes loaded with collagen-targeting human PDGF-BB could effectively promote ulcer healing.",

The newly\ndiscovered objects were detected as very red objects in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey imaging data and have JHK colors between the red L dwarfs and the blue\nGl229B-like T dwarfs. They show both CO and methane absorption in their\nnear-infrared spectra in addition to water, with weaker methane absorption\nfeatures in the H and K bands than those in all other methane dwarfs reported\nto date. Due to the presence of methane in these bands, we propose that these\nobjects are early T dwarfs. The three form part of the brown dwarf spectral\nsequence and fill in the large gap in the overall spectral sequence from the\nhottest main sequence stars to the coolest methane dwarfs currently known.",

        "abstract": "Nerve regeneration is blocked after spinal cord injury (SCI) by a complex myelin-associated inhibitory (MAI) microenvironment in the lesion site; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. During the process of neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation, pathway inhibitors were added to quantitatively assess effects on neuronal differentiation. Immunoprecipitation and lentivirus-induced overexpression were used to examine effects in vitro. In vivo, animal experiments and lineage tracing methods were used to identify nascent neurogenesis after SCI. In vitro results indicated that myelin inhibited neuronal differentiation by activating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade. Subsequently, we found that tripartite motif (TRIM) 32, a neuronal fate-determining factor, was inhibited. Moreover, inhibition of EGFR-ERK promoted TRIM32 expression and enhanced neuronal differentiation in the presence of myelin. We further demonstrated that ERK interacts with TRIM32 to regulate neuronal differentiation. In vivo results indicated that EGFR-ERK blockade increased TRIM32 expression and promoted neurogenesis in the injured area, thus enhancing functional recovery after SCI. Our results showed that EGFR-ERK blockade antagonized MAI of neuronal differentiation of NSCs through regulation of TRIM32 by ERK. Collectively, these findings may provide potential new targets for SCI repair.",

        "abstract": "Appropriate three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds and signal molecules could accelerate tissue regeneration and wound repair. In this work, we targeted human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a potent angiogenic factor, to a fibrin scaffold to improve therapeutic angiogenesis. We fused bFGF to the Kringle4 domain (K4), a fibrin-binding peptide from human plasminogen, to endow bFGF with specific fibrin-binding ability. The recombinant K4bFGF bound specifically to the fibrin scaffold so that K4bFGF was delivered in a site-specific manner, and the fibrin scaffold provided 3D support for cell migration and proliferation. Subcutaneous implantation of the fibrin scaffolds bound with K4bFGF but not with bFGF induced neovascularization. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly more proliferation cells in the fibrin scaffolds incorporated with K4bFGF than in those with bFGF. Moreover, the regenerative tissues were integrated well with the fibrin scaffolds, suggesting its good biocompatibility. In summary, targeted delivery of K4bFGF could potentially improve therapeutic angiogenesis.",

During the controller design, fuzzy logical systems are used to model packaged unknown nonlinearities and backstepping technique is used to construct adaptive fuzzy decentralized controller. It is shown that the proposed control scheme can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. The main advantage of this study lies in that only one adaptive parameter needs to be estimated online for each subsystem. Simulation results further illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

Methods Patients who underwent canal wall-down tympanoplasty for chronic ear diseases from June 2008 to January 2011 in the Department of Otolaryngology, Eye Ear Nose & Throat Hospital, Fudan University were reviewed retrospectively (n=87). Using pure tone audiometry, air-conductive threshold (AC), bone-conductive threshold ( BC ), and air-bone gap (ABG), and pre-and post-operative changes were analyzed for each of the followingfrequencies: 0.25 kHz, 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 3 kHz, 4 kHz (AC and BC) and 6 kHz (AC). Frequency-specific results were investigated in relation to various surgical factors. Results Both AC and ABG results showed improvements at each frequency, primarily in the low and mid frequencies. The improvement decreased gradually from low to high frequencies. BC results showed significant improvement at every frequency except 4 kHz. In patients without ossiculoplasty, BC results improved significantly only at 1 kHz. Conclusion Canal wall-down tympanoplasty for chronic ear diseases can improve hearing primarily in low and mid frequencies.",

        "abstract": "Paracrine factors are currently considered to be the major mechanism through which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exert their actions. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of conditioned medium (CM) from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) on bleomycin (BLM)‑induced lung injury and fibrosis, both in vitro and in vivo. A549 human non‑small cell lung cancer epithelial cells were cultured in serum‑free medium, or MSC‑CM, both with or without BLM. The protective effects of MSC‑CM was determined by MTT assay to assess cell viability and Annexin V‑PE to assess apoptosis. Rats were intratracheally injected with MSC‑CM, saline, or conditioned medium from fibroblasts on day 0 and day 3 after intratracheal administration of BLM, and were sacrificed on day 28. Lung injury and fibrosis were assessed by histological assessment, Ashcroft score, and hydroxyproline assay; lung cell apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. In comparison to the control group (0.17±0.01), 8 and 16% MSC‑CM had a significant stimulatory effect on A549 cellular proliferation (0.24±0.03 and 0.24±0.04, respectively, P&amp;lt;0.01). A549 cells cultured with MSC‑CM were protected from BLM‑induced apoptosis, 23.43±3.76% vs. 38.06±4.32%; (P&amp;lt;0.05). In the BLM‑challenged rats, MSC‑CM was shown to protect against lung fibrosis in terms of lung inflammation, fibrotic scores, collagen deposition, and cell apoptosis. This data suggests that MSCs are capable of protecting against lung injury and fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo through a paracrine anti‑inflammatory mechanism. MSC‑CM may provide a novel approach for the treatment of lung fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "This study was aimed to investigate the clinical feasibility of using multiplex PT-PCR assay for screening rare/cryptic chromosome translocations in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. For 126 patients with de novo AML-M4/M5 without common chromosome translocations including t(15;17), t(8;21) and t(16;16), 3 parallel multiplex RT-PCR assays were set up to detect 6 mll-related gene rearrangements (mll/af10, mll/af17, mll/ell, mll/af9, mll/af6 and mll/enl) with low detection rate and 4 rare fusion genes (dek/can, tls/erg, aml1/mds (evi1) and npm/mlf1). The results showed that 11 patients with positive result from 126 patients were detected which involved in 5 molecular abnormalities. Among them, 10 cases were AML-M5 (16.67%), 1 cases AML-M4 (1.51%). The marker chromosomes were observed in 2 cases out of 11 cases through conventional karyotyping analysis, the karyotyping analysis in 1 case was not performed because this case had 1 mitotic figure only, no any cytogenetic aberrations were found in other 8 cases through R-band karyotyping analysis. It is concluded that multiplex RT-PCR designed in this study can quickly, effectively and accurately identify the rare/cryptic chromosome translocations and can be used in clinical detection.",

        "abstract": "Studies show that VEGF can promote tissue regeneration in diabetic wounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a new composite biomaterial, a collagen scaffold with CBD-VEGF, for wound healing in a diabetic rat model.We produced a collagen scaffold loaded with CBD-VEGF, which allowed VEGF to bind to the collagen scaffold. The diabetic rat model was constructed by injecting streptozocin (STZ) peritoneally and removing a 2 x 2.5 cm thick slice of skin from the back of the animal. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups: blank control (BC Group, n = 24), collagen scaffold loaded with PBS (PBS Group, n = 24), collagen scaffold loaded with NAT-VEGF (NAT-VEGF Group, n = 24), and collagen scaffold loaded with CBD-VEGF (CBD-VEGF Group, n = 24). Wounds of the BC Group were covered with gauze and those of the PBS, NAT-VEGF and CBD-VEGF Groups were grafted by corresponding collagen scaffolds, respectively. Healing rates were calculated and compared among groups. Wound tissue was evaluated by histologic analysis.The CBD-VEGF group showed a higher wound healing rate, better vascularization and higher level of VEGF in the granulation tissue wound compared with NAT-VEGF and PBS groups.The collagen scaffold with CBD-VEGF promoted wound healing in a diabetic rat model, which could potentially provide better therapeutic options for the treatment of diabetic wounds.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a topical Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) compound Tangzu Yuyang Ointment (TYO) for treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers.This multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled and add-on clinical trial was conducted at seven centers in the China mainland. Fifty-seven patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers of Wagner's ulcer grade 1-3 were enrolled in this study. Patients who were randomly assigned to the control group (n=28) received standard wound therapy (SWT), whereas those randomized to the treatment group (n=28) received SWT plus topical TYO. Only 48 patients who finished 24 weeks of observations were entered for data analysis.The TYO and SWT groups were comparable for baseline characteristics. Ulcer improvement was 79.2% in the TYO group and 41.7% in the SWT group (P=0.017) at 12 weeks, and 91.7% vs. 62.5% (P=0.036) at 24 weeks. The number of ulcers that were completely healed at 4, 12 and 24 weeks was similar in both groups, as were the numbers of adverse events. Healing time was 96±56 days (n=19) in the TYO group and 75±53 days (n=14) in the SWT group (P=0.271).TYO plus SWT is more effective than SWT in the management of chronic diabetic foot ulcers and has few side-effects.",

The time delays are assumed to be bounded and time varying and the uncertainties are assumed to be norm bounded.

Here we examined whether 3D sphere culture have any impact on the differentiated cells. We cultured bladder cancer cell RT4 and non-cancerous cell HEK293 on the low attachment dishes coated with soft agarose. When grown on this low attachment dish, cells spontaneously aggregated to form 3D spheres. Data showed that 3D sphere formation promoted the expression of reprogramming factors. Sphere formation of RT4 cells induced cancer stem cell characteristics including higher SP cell percentage, higher metastasis ability and higher tumorigenicity. HEK293 spheres showed upregulation of kidney progenitor cell markers and partially acquired characteristics of ESCs including upregulation of alkaline phosphatase activity, ES cell markers, three germ layer markers and tumorigenicity. The findings suggested that forced growth into 3D spheres by the low attachment surface could induce cells to acquire stemness properties.",

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important active protein for the induction of angiogenesis and improvement in cardiac function after myocardial ischemia; however, the lack of a delivery system targeted to the injured myocardium reduces the local therapeutic efficacy of VEGF and increases its possible adverse effects.We produced a fusion protein (CBD-VEGF) consisting of VEGF and a collagen-binding domain (CBD). The fusion protein specifically bound to type I collagen in vitro. In addition, CBD-VEGF promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation after binding to collagen, which indicates that it retained both growth factor activity and collagen-binding ability. When implanted subcutaneously in rats, collagen membranes loaded with CBD-VEGF were significantly vascularized. After it was injected into rats with acute myocardial infarction, CBD-VEGF was largely retained in the cardiac extracellular matrix, in which collagen I was rich. Four weeks after VEGF or CBD-VEGF was injected into the infarct border zone, cardiac function detected by echocardiography and hemodynamics was preserved in the CBD-VEGF group. Administration of CBD-VEGF also induced reduction of scar size, whereas native VEGF did not have these effects. In addition, a significant increase in the number of capillary vessels in infarcted hearts was found in the CBD-VEGF group.The injection of CBD-VEGF improved cardiac function in rats with induced acute myocardial infarction. This could potentially provide a new treatment option for myocardial infarction.",

        "abstract": "We present observations of SDSSp J104433.04--012502.2, a luminous quasar at\nz=5.80 discovered from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multicolor imaging data.\nThis object was selected as an i'-band dropout object, with i*=21.8 +/- 0.2,\nz*=19.2 +/- 0.1. It has an absolute magnitude M1450 = -27.2 (H_0 =50 km/s/Mpc,\nq0 = 0.5). The spectrum shows a strong and broad Ly alpha emission line, strong\nLy alpha forest absorption lines with a mean continuum decrement D_A = 0.91,\nand a Lyman Limit System at z=5.72. The spectrum also shows strong OI and SiIV\nemission lines similar to those of quasars at z<= 5, suggesting that these\nmetals were produced at redshift beyond six. The lack of a Gunn-Peterson trough\nin the spectrum indicates that the universe is already highly ionized at z ~\n5.8. Using a high-resolution spectrum in the Ly alpha forest region, we place a\nconservative upper limit of the optical depth due to the Gunn-Peterson effect\nof tau < 0.5 in regions of minimum absorption. The Ly alpha forest absorption\nin this object is much stronger than that in quasars at z<= 5. The object is\nunresolved in a deep image with excellent seeing, implying that it is unlensed.\nThe black hole mass of this quasar is ~3 x 10^9 M_solar if we assume that it is\nradiating at the Eddington luminosity and no lensing amplification, implying\nthat it resides in a very massive dark matter halo. The discovery of one quasar\nat M_1450 < -27 in a survey area of 600 deg^2 is consistent with an\nextrapolation of the observed luminosity function at lower redshift. The\nabundance and evolution of such quasars can provide sensitive tests of models\nof quasar and galaxy formation.",

        "abstract": "The fate of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is determined by many extracellular cues. Among them, insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family are found to promote the neuronal differentiation of NPCs. Akt activation has been indicated to be responsible for the insulin/IGF-I induced neuronal differentiation. However, the mechanism by which insulin/IGF-I-PI3K-Akt pathway induces neurogenesis of NPCs is not clear. In this study, we have demonstrated that mTOR is involved in the insulin-induced neuronal differentiation. Insulin induces neurogenesis of NPCs in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylated mTOR has been up-regulated in a PI3K-Akt dependent manner during NPC differentiation induced by insulin. The specific inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin, can abrogate the increase of differentiated neurons stimulated by insulin. In addition, this is not the result from the apoptosis of neurons or NPCs. This research has extended the understanding of functions of mTOR and the mechanism of NPC differentiation regulated by insulin.",

In this paper, a novel Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) like one-transistor-one-resistor (1T1R) structure is proposed, in which the source/drain of the transistor also serves as the bottom electrode of the RRAM device. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatible Hf-based Si/HfO 2/TiN RRAM devices were fabricated and ultralow switching current/power was obtained. The set/reset current can be as low as 50 nA/1.25 nA. The programming power for set and reset is only 18 μW and 1.625 nW, respectively. The mechanism of both Schottky emission and electronic hopping via oxygen vacancy defects is proposed to explain the measured resistive switching characteristics. © 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.",

        "abstract": "In the latest in our series of papers on XMM-Newton and ground-based optical\nfollow-up of new candidate magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) found in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey, we report classifications of three systems: SDSS\nJ144659.95+025330.3, SDSS J205017.84-053626.8, and SDSS J210131.26+105251.5.\nBoth the X-ray and optical fluxes of SDSS J1446+02 are modulated on a period of\n48.7+/-0.5 min, with the X-ray modulation showing the characteristic energy\ndependence of photo-electric absorption seen in many intermediate polars (IP).\nA longer period modulation and radial velocity variation is also seen at a\nperiod around 4 hrs, though neither dataset set is long enough to constrain\nthis longer, likely orbital, period well. SDSS J2050-05 appears to be an\nexample of the most highly magnetized class of mCV, a disk-less, stream-fed\npolar. Its 1.57 hr orbital period is well-constrained via optical eclipse\ntimings; in the X-ray it shows both eclipses and an underlying strong, smooth\nmodulation. In this case, broadly phase-resolved spectral fits indicate that\nthis change in flux is the result of a varying normalization of the dominant\ncomponent (a 41 keV MEKAL), plus the addition of a partial covering absorber\nduring the lower flux interval. SDSS J2101+10 is a more perplexing system to\ncategorize: its X-ray and optical fluxes exhibit no large periodic modulations;\nthere are only barely detectable changes in the velocity structure of its\noptical emission lines; the X-ray spectra require only absorption by the\ninterstellar medium; and the temperatures of the MEKAL fits are low, with\nmaximum temperature components of either 10 or 25 keV. We conclude that SDSS\nJ2101+10 can not be an IP, nor likely a polar, but is rather most likely a disc\naccretor-- a low inclination SW Sex star.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ballastless tracks are becoming more popular with their lower overall lifecycle costs and increased lateral load capabilities but cracking due to cyclic vehicle loads and temperature loads have known to cause cracking which has become a major problem for this kind of construction. Based on the needs of the repair material, Magnesium Phosphate Cement has been studied in this paper as a possibility. A finite element model of a stretch of ballastless track slab has been developed to study the stress and strain properties of MPC repaired ballastless track under different temperature conditions. Results have then been compared to that for epoxy resin which is currently the industry standard for these kinds of repair. The analysis revealed that stress concentration occurred at the end of crack and that the smaller the magnitude of this stress concentration, the more obvious its effects were. The cracking resistance of MPC was found to be comparable to that of epoxy resin, though not better than epoxy resin. However, MPC was concluded to be more suitable than epoxy resin practically because of its superior compatibility with concrete, lower coefficient of linear expansion, better stability to temperature changes and lower setting times.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Geopolymers are considered to be a sustainable and environmentally friendly replacement for ordinary Portland cement as they lead to a reduction in carbon footprint. The dosage and type of precursors and alkali activators have been known to be important parameters affecting the fresh and hardened properties of geopolymers. This study investigates the effect of slag content as well as type and dosage of alkali activators on one-part fly ash-based geopolymers cured at room temperature. Different ratios of fly ash were replaced with slag as a CaO-rich precursor. Setting time and flowability tests were carried out to evaluate the fresh properties, compressive and flexural strength experiments were conducted to determine the mechanical properties of the geopolymers. The mineralogy and microstructure of the samples were evaluated by Optical microscope, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM-EDS) analysis. The experimental results revealed that the increase of slag content improved the strength and reduced workability. Moreover, some microcracks were observed when over 15% of fly ash was replaced with slag. In terms of activators, the sodium metasilicate anhydrous provided optimum strength and higher flowability compared to the others. Microstructural analysis results showed the presence of more unreacted particles when less than 8% Na 2 SiO 3  content as alkaline activator and also less than 15% slag as replacement was used in the system.",

        "abstract": "The main challenge for neural progenitor cell (NPC)-mediated repair of spinal cord injury (SCI) is lack of favorable environment to direct its differentiation towards neurons rather than glial cells. The myelin associated inhibitors have been demonstrated to promote NPC differentiation into glial lineage. Herein, to inhibit the downstream signaling activated by myelin associated inhibitors, cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing antibody, functionalized collagen scaffold has been developed as a vehicle for NPC implantation. It was found that collagen-cetuximab 1 μg scaffolds enhanced neuronal differentiation and inhibited astrocytic differentiation of NPCs exposed to myelin proteins significantly in vitro. To test the therapeutic effect in vivo, NPCs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-embedded scaffolds have been implanted into the 4 mm-long hemisection lesion of rats. We found that the collagen-cetuximab 5 μg scaffolds induced neuronal differentiation and decreased astrocytic differentiation of NPCs, enhanced axon regeneration, and promoted functional recovery markedly. A well-functionalized scaffold was constructed to improve the recovery of SCI, which could promote the neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells in vivo.",

This correspondence suggests a decoupling technique for solving matrix inequalities with coupled variables, and provides an LMI-based algorithm by adopting the idea of the cone complementarity problem.

Fiber volume fractions of 1.5%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5% and binder/aggregate ratios of 1:1, 1:1.2 and 1:1.5 were designed for the experiments. The microstructural, mechanical and water resistance properties of fiber-reinforced MPCs were evaluated with respects to the variance in the fiber volume fraction, the ratio of binder/aggregate. The results showed that the glass fibers have more pronounced effects on the flexural strength compared to compressive strength. The optimum volume fraction of glass fiber is reported at 2.5%. Furthermore, the effect of glass fiber on the water resistance of MPC is discussed, and a “reserving” method to resist the strength loss by water has been proposed. In addition, the paper provides a possible explanation of the fiber reinforcement mechanism which is in agreement with the experimental results.",

        "abstract": "To induce human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to differentiate into chondrocytes in three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments, we developed porous hydrogel scaffolds using the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) components of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and collagen (COL). The turbidity and viscosity experiments indicated hydrogel could form through pH-triggered co-precipitation when pH=2-3. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the hydrogel scaffolds could controllably release growth factors as envisaged. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) was released to stimulate hMSCs differentiation into chondrocytes; and then collagen binding domain-basic fibroblast growth factor (CBD-bFGF) was released to improve the differentiation and preserve the chondrocyte phenotype. In in vitro cell culture experiments, the differentiation processes were compared in different microenvironments: 2D culture in culture plate as control, 3D culture in the fabricated scaffolds without growth factors (CC), the samples with CBD-bFGF (CC-C), the samples with TGF-β (CC-T), the samples with CBD-bFGF/TGF-β (CC-CT). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed the hMSC marker genes of CD44 and CD105 decreased; at the same time the chondrocyte marker genes of collagen type II and aggrecan increased, especially in the CC-CT sample. Immunostaining results further confirmed the hMSC marker protein of CD 44 disappeared and the chondrocyte marker protein of collagen type II emerged over time in the CC-CT sample. These results imply the ECM-based hydrogel scaffolds with growth factors can supply suitable 3D cell niches for hMSCs differentiation into chondrocytes and the differentiation process can be regulated by the controllably released growth factors.",

Experimental results showed that incorporation of FA improved the mechanical properties, temperature resistance and water stability of MPC composites. TGA results exhibited that the mass loss of MPC composites was gradually reduced by increasing the percentage of FA. MIP analysis showed that cumulative pore volume, volume percentage of large pores and mean pore diameter of were decreased with the addition of FA. XRD and SEM-EDS analysis of MPC composites revealed the formation of secondary reaction products, that could be possibly responsible for the superior properties of FA/MPC composites. Importantly, the results of all characterization techniques corroborated with the mechanical results of MPC composites.",

        "abstract": "Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) transplantation is a promising or potential therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI). However, their clinical use is limited because of the availability. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have been identified as an alternative source of adult stem cells in recent years. ADSCs could be differentiated into various mesenchymal tissues cells such as chondrocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts, and myocytes and also could be differentiated into neural lineages. In this study, we examined the feasibility of using ADSCs as a source of stem cells for the differentiation of OECs by co-culture approach. When co-cultured with OECs, the ADSCs on three-dimensional collagen scaffolds were differentiated into OEC-like cells, with similar morphology and antigenic phenotypes (p75NTR+/Nestin+/GFAP-) of OECs. Co-cultured ADSCs were positive for several important functional markers of mature OECs such as neurotrophic factor GDNF, BDNF and myelin protein PLP and the conditioned medium of OEC-like cells could significantly promote DRG neuron growth and axon sprouting without NGF supporting in contrast to that of the ADSCs. Our results showed that ADSCs had the potential to differentiate into OEC-like cells on the three-dimensional collagen scaffolds in vitro.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance, strong side effects, and compliance problems in TB chemotherapy mandate new ways to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Here we show that deletion of the gene encoding homoserine transacetylase (metA) inactivates methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) biosynthesis in Mtb and renders this pathogen exquisitely sensitive to killing in immunocompetent or immunocompromised mice, leading to rapid clearance from host tissues. Mtb ΔmetA is unable to proliferate in primary human macrophages, and in vitro starvation leads to extraordinarily rapid killing with no appearance of suppressor mutants. Cell death of Mtb ΔmetA is faster than that of other auxotrophic mutants (i.e., tryptophan, pantothenate, leucine, biotin), suggesting a particularly potent mechanism of killing. Time-course metabolomics showed complete depletion of intracellular methionine and SAM. SAM depletion was consistent with a significant decrease in methylation at the DNA level (measured by single-molecule real-time sequencing) and with the induction of several essential methyltransferases involved in biotin and menaquinone biosynthesis, both of which are vital biological processes and validated targets of antimycobacterial drugs. Mtb ΔmetA could be partially rescued by biotin supplementation, confirming a multitarget cell death mechanism. The work presented here uncovers a previously unidentified vulnerability of Mtb—the incapacity to scavenge intermediates of SAM and methionine biosynthesis from the host. This vulnerability unveils an entirely new drug target space with the promise of rapid killing of the tubercle bacillus by a new mechanism of action.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been revealed to have important roles in carcinogenesis. Metastasis is the leading cause of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC) death. However, the contributions of circRNA to the metastasis of LUAC remain largely unknown. Based on circBase data and our biobank tissues, we identified circCRIM1 (a circRNA derived from exons 2, 3 and 4 of the CRIM1 gene, hsa_circ_0002346) as having a significantly decreased expression in LUAC samples compared with matched normal control samples. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that circCRIM1 suppresses the invasion and metastasis of LUAC. In vitro precipitation of circRNAs, luciferase reporter assay and biotin-coupled microRNA capture were conducted to investigate the AGO2-dependent interaction of circCRIM1 and miR-93/miR-182 dependent. Mechanistically, we found that circCRIM1 could promote the expression of LIFR, a well-known tumor suppressor, by sponging miR-93 and miR-182. In the clinical and pathological analyses, the downregulation of circCRIM1 in LUAC was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis and TNM stage, which served as an independent risk factor for the overall survival of patients with LUAC. Our study showed that circCRIM1 inhibits the invasion and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells, which makes it a potential therapeutic target. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: Speech recognition experiments were conducted to measure the tone recognition with standard assessment table and standard testing program. A total of 34 postlingual hearing-impaired adults who were native speakers of Mandarin undergoing operations from June to October, 2009 were tested and scored both preoperatively and postoperatively ( 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 months post-implantation) for speech recognition. Results: All patient scores of speech recognition (initials, finals, monosyllabic words &tones) decreased gradually during the postoperative follow-up period. Preoperative speech recognition scores were all 0. And after a 12-month training, their average scores were increased significantly [ (70±8)%±(82±8)% ]. Significant statistical differences existed between pre- and post-implantation in each test ( P >0.01). Conclusion: REZ-1 cochlear implantation may improve the tone recognition of adults with severe-to-profound postlingual hearing loss in a quiet environment.",

The thickness of the multi-layer stack for a 3D RRAM is a key factor for determining the storage density. A vertical RRAM cell with plane electrode thickness (tm) scaled down to 5 nm, aiming to minimize 3D stack height, is experimentally demonstrated. An improvement factor of 5 in device density can be achieved as compared to a previous demonstration using a 22 nm thick plane electrode. It is projected that 37 layers can be stacked for a lithographic half-pitch (F) = 26 nm and total thickness of one stack (T) = 21 nm, delivering a bit density of 72.8 nm(2)/cell.",

        "abstract": "Living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been considered an alternative method for treatment of patients with end-stage liver disease. However, the characteristics of pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in patients who underwent LDLT were not clear. This study was designed to compare the pharmacokinetics of MPA and its metabolites between LDLT patients and deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) patients after oral administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Thirteen patients who underwent LDLT and 14 patients who underwent DDLT were enrolled prospectively. All patients received oral MMF administration (1.0 g, twice daily) in combination with tacrolimus (TAC). The plasma concentrations of MPA, free MPA, glucuronide (MPAG), and acyl glucuronide (AcMPAG) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography method. There was a wide variation in various pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA and its metabolites in patients who underwent LDLT and DDLT after oral MMF administration. Although mean MPA area under the plasma concentration time curve for 0-12 hours (AUC(0-12h)) of MPA and MPAG in DDLT patients were higher than those in LDLT patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups. MPA concentration at 6 hours (C(6h)), C(10h), C(12h), and MPA AUC(6-12h) were significantly higher in DDLT group than those in LDLT group (P < 0.05). Inversely, higher free MPA AUC(0-12h) and significant free MPA fraction (P < 0.05) in LDLT patients were observed in DDLT patients when compared with DDLT group. AcMPAG concentrations at 4, 8, and 10 hours and AcMPAG AUC(0-12h) were significantly higher in the DDLT group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, after a fixed oral dose of MMF, DDLT patients had higher enterohepatic recycling contributing to total MPA exposure compared with LDLT patients. The function of glucuronide conjugation in LDLT patients was decreased compared with that in DDLT patients. Higher free MPA AUC(0-12h) and a significantly higher fraction of free MPA in LDLT patients suggested that a lower oral dose of MMF may be administered for patients who underwent LDLT.",

        "abstract": "Regeneration of damaged neurons and recovery of sensation and motor function after complete spinal cord injury (SCI) are challenging. We previously developed a collagen scaffold, NeuroRegen, to promote axonal growth along collagen fibers and inhibit glial scar formation after SCI. When functionalized with multiple biomolecules, this scaffold promoted neurological regeneration and functional recovery in animals with SCI. In this study, eight patients with chronic complete SCI were enrolled to examine the safety and efficacy of implanting NeuroRegen scaffold with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs). Using intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, we identified and surgically resected scar tissues to eliminate the inhibitory effect of glial scarring on nerve regeneration. We then implanted NeuroRegen scaffold loaded with hUCB-MSCs into the resection sites. No adverse events (infection, fever, headache, allergic reaction, shock, perioperative complications, aggravation of neurological status, or cancer) were observed during 1 year of follow-up. Primary efficacy outcomes, including expansion of sensation level and motor-evoked potential (MEP)-responsive area, increased finger activity, enhanced trunk stability, defecation sensation, and autonomic neural function recovery, were observed in some patients. Our findings suggest that combined application of NeuroRegen scaffold and hUCB-MSCs is safe and feasible for clinical therapy in patients with chronic SCI. Our study suggests that construction of a regenerative microenvironment using a scaffold-based strategy may be a possible future approach to SCI repair.",

        "abstract": "The resistive random access memory (RRAM) crossbar array has been extensively studied as one of the most promising candidates for future high-density nonvolatile memory technology. However, some problems caused by circuit and device interaction, such as sneak leakage paths, result in limited array size and large power consumption, which degrade the array performance significantly. Thus, the analysis on circuit and device interaction issue is imperative. In this paper, a simulation method is developed to investigate the critical issues correlated with the interaction between devices and the circuit. The simulations show that a large off/on ratio of resistance states of RRAM is beneficial for large readout margin (i.e., array size). The existence of the selector connected in series with an RRAM device can eliminate the need for high Ron resistance, which is critical for the array consisted of only RRAM cells. The readout margin is more sensitive to the variation of Ron and is determined by the nonlinearity of the I-V characteristics of RRAM, whereas the nonlinear characteristics of the selector device are beneficial for a larger readout margin. An optimal design scheme for turn-on voltage and conductance of the selector is proposed based on the simulation.",

        "abstract": "To explore the effective surgical approaches in treating subclavian artery occlusion.Between December 2005 and February 2010, 53 patients with subclavian artery occlusion were treated, including left subclavian artery occlusion (35 cases) and stenosis (5 cases), right subclavian artery occlusion (5 cases) and stenosis (4 cases), and bilateral subclavian artery occlusion (4 cases). There were 40 males and 13 females with an average age of 64 years (range, 22-77 years), including 49 cases of arteriosclerosis obliterans and 4 cases of aortic arteritis. The disease duration was 15 days to 20 months (6.5 months on average). In 49 patients with unilateral subclavian artery occlusion, 39 cases complicated by carotid or/ and cerebral artery lesion underwent axillo-axillary bypass grafting, and 10 cases without carotid or/and cerebral artery lesion underwent carotid-subclavian bypass grafting. Ascending aorta to bi-subclavian bypass grafting were performed on 4 cases with bilateral subclavian artery occlusion. After operation, patients received routine treatment with anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents.The operations were successfully performed in 52 cases with a successful rate of 98.11%. Thrombogenesis at anastomotic site occurred in 1 case of aortic arteritis after 48 hours. Two cases had brachial plexus crush injury and 4 had hematoma around the bilateral anastomosis after axillo-axillary bypass grafting, and all recovered with nonoperative therapy. A total of 52 patients were followed up 1-52 months (24.5 months on average). All patients survived and the symptoms of basilar and upper limb artery ischemia disappeared. Doppler ultrasonography showed that the blood flow was patent through anastomosis and polytetrafluoroethylene graft, and the vertebral artery flow was normal. Pseudoaneurysm at anastomosis was found in 1 case after 18 months and treated by interventional embolization. The postoperative graft patency rate was 100% at 1 year and at 2 years.Both thoracic and extrathoracic surgical approaches are effective for treating subclavian artery occlusion. The reasonable surgical approach should be selected according to the arteriopathy and the patient's condition. Perioperative treatment and strict intraoperative manipulation are important to guarantee the success of surgery.",

Specialized transduction was performed to create a null mutant in the pknI gene. The resulting mutant was used to determine the role of PknI in M. tuberculosis growth and infectivity. The pknI mutant grows better under acidic pH and limited oxygen availability. We observed a modest increased growth of pknI mutant within macrophages during an in vitro infection and a hypervirulence phenotype in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The internal signals used to activate PknI are most likely the host-associated signals such as low pH associated with limited oxygen availability. Thus, we have shown that PknI plays a role in sensing the host macrophage's environment and translating it to slow the growth of M. tuberculosis within the infected host.",

        "abstract": "Minimal residual disease detection in the bone marrow is usually performed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing one course of induction chemotherapy. To optimize the chemotherapy strategies, more practical and sensitive markers are needed to monitor the early treatment response during induction. For instance, peripheral blood (PB) blast clearance rate may be considered as such a monitoring marker.PB blasts were monitored through multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). Absolute counts were determined before treatment (D0) and at specified time points of induction chemotherapy (D3, D5, D7, and D9). The cut-off value of D5 peripheral blast clearance rate (D5-PBCR) was defined through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Prognostic effects were compared among different patient groups according to D5-PBCR cut-off value.D5-PBCR cut-off value was determined as 99.55%. Prognostic analysis showed that patients with D5-PBCR ≥99.55% more likely achieved complete remission (94.6% vs. 56.1%, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and maintained a relapse-free status than other patients (80.56% vs. 57.14%, P = 0.027). Survival analysis revealed that relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were longer in patients with D5-PBCR ≥99.55% than in other patients (two-year OS: 71.0% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.011; two-year RFS: 69.4% vs. 30.7%, P = 0.026). In cytogenetic-molecular intermediate-risk group, a subgroup with worse outcome could be distinguished on the basis of D5-PBCR (&amp;lt;99.55%; OS: P = 0.033, RFS: P = 0.086).An effective evaluation method of early treatment response was established by monitoring PB blasts through MFC. D5-PBCR cut-off value (99.55%) can be a reliable reference to predict treatment response and outcome in early stages of chemotherapy. The proposed marker may be used in induction regimen modification and help optimize cytogenetic-molecular prognostic risk stratification.",

The air cell and its abutting structures, including the facial nerve (FN), were reconstructed using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) data.In 68.3% (n = 205) of patients, the SF was observed in surgery. It is situated at the posterior wall of the facial recess of the retrotympanum. This air cell, usually the only one present on the surface of the pyramidal segment of the FN canal (FNC), is usually the largest if small air cells are found nearby. Its delineated location is as follows: pyramidal eminence and the pyramidal segment of the FNC medially, the deeper external acoustic meatus laterally, the aditus ad antrum superiorly, the posterior part of the tympanic annulus, and the chordal ridge anterior-inferiorly. Its configuration varies between rounded (11.7%, n = 35), curved-rod (52.7%, n = 158), and irregular (4%, n = 12). Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of HRCT in detecting the SF were 79.0% and 88.4%, respectively.Occurrence and configuration of the SF is not a rule; however, the positive positional relationship between the SF and the second genu of the FNC is a rule, if the SF is detected. Considering this, the SF may be an important anatomic landmark to identify the FN during otosurgery. However, HRCT has a limited diagnostic value when the SF is atypical.",

        "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis and risk of lymph node positivity (LN+) are reference points for reasonable treatments. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of age on LN+ and NSCLC death. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry were used to identify 82,253 patients with NSCLC diagnosed between 1988 and 2008. All the patients underwent standard lung cancer surgery with lymph node examination. Demographic and clinicopathological parameters were extracted and compared among each age group. Impact of age on LN+ and NSCLC death was evaluated by the Cochran-Armitage trend test and logistic univariate and multivariate analyses for all T stages. Overall, 22,711 (27.60%) patients of the entirety had lymph node metastasis and 28,968 (35.22%) patients died of NSCLC within 5 years. With the increase in age, LN+ rates decreased regardless of T stages (<0.001), whereas NSCLC-specific mortality increased in stages T1-T3 (<0.001). Controlling other covariates in multivariable logistic regression, age remained an independent risk factor for LN+ in all T stages (<0.05) and in stages T1-T3 (<0.05). Our SEER analysis demonstrated a higher rate of LN+ and lower mortality in younger patients with NSCLC, after accounting for other covariates.",

Various studies have demonstrated that Huaier could inhibit cancer progression and improve the prognosis of patients. In the present study, we comprehensively screened the expression profiles of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in Huaier-treated breast cancer cells. Using bioinformatic analysis, hub genes were identified and functionally annotated. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was applied to construct the molecular network influenced by Huaier. Linc00339 was then found to play a critical role in Huaier-mediated cancer suppression. To validate the effects of linc00339 and identify the downstream targets, we performed  and  experiments.

The merit of the suggested controller design scheme is that the number of online adapted parameters is independent of the number of nodes of the neural networks, which reduces the number of the online adaptive learning laws considerably. The proposed controller guarantees that all closed-loop signals remain bounded, while the output tracking error dynamics converges to a neighborhood of the origin. A simulation example is given to illustrate the design procedure and performance of the proposed method.",

BALB/c mices (n = 5) were intramuscularly injected with 100 microg psaA DNA vaccine for three times, and then boosted with 50 microg recombinant PsaA protein. The antibody response against PsaA was measured by ELISA.The psaA gene was amplified and subcloned successfully. The constructed psaA DNA vaccine was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the recombinant PsaA protein was purified by the one-step Ni(2+) affinity chromatography. Expression of the PsaA was observed in cells transfected with pVAX1-psaA. The animal experiment results showed that the anti-PsaA level of the DNA prime-protein boosting mice was higher significantly than the other groups (t = 87.518, P < 0.05).The psaA DNA vaccine was prepared successfully, and the immunogenicity of Streptococcus pneumoniae psaA DNA vaccine could be improved significantly by the DNA prime and protein boost strategy.",

However, significant challenges including long-term survival, directed neuronal differentiation, and functional integration of the transplanted NSCs and their progenies within the host spinal cord are yet to be solved. In this study, NSCs are trained on differently modified collagen scaffolds to increase their neuronal differentiation rate when cultured under the simulated SCI microenvironment. Then, a functional scaffold is screened out, on which the cultured NSCs show high neuronal differentiation rate and generate both sensory and motor mature neurons. Subsequently, that NSC seeded functional scaffold is transplanted into a rat severe SCI model. The results show that higher endogenous neurogenesis efficiency as well as in vivo survival and neuronal differentiation rate of the grafted NSCs are observed. Moreover, both sensory and motor neurons are found to be differentiated from the grafted NSCs in the lesion site and those newly generated neurons can functionally interact with each other and the host neurons. Taken together, the in vitro training systems for modulating the differentiation profiles of NSCs are instructive and exhibit strong potentials for SCI treatments.",

It's demonstrated that the compressive strength ranges from 0.7 to 2.5 MPa,which is higher than that of similar products.Furthermore,low elastic module and high residual to ultimate strength ratio ensure its excellent deformation and energy absorption capacity.At last,numerical analysis was performed to interpret the inherent variation of elastic modulus and failure mechanism of this material.The results show that EPS foamed concrete is a kind of super lightweight,easy to fabricate material with excellent compressive property and profound utilization potential.",

        "abstract": "Natural biological functional scaffolds, consisting of biological materials filled with promoting elements, provide a promising strategy for the regeneration of peripheral nerve defects. Collagen conduits have been used widely due to their excellent biological properties. Linear ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) fibers are good lumen fillers that can guide nerve regeneration in an ordered direction. In addition, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is important in the recovery of nerve injury. However, the traditional method for delivering bFGF to the lesion site has no long-term effect because of its short half-life and rapid diffusion. Therefore, we fused a specific collagen-binding domain (CBD) peptide to the N-terminal of native basic fibroblast growth factor (NAT-bFGF) to retain bFGF on the collagen scaffolds. In this study, a natural biological functional scaffold was constructed using collagen tubes filled with collagen-binding bFGF (CBD-bFGF)-loaded LOCS to promote regeneration in a 5-mm rat sciatic nerve transection model. Functional evaluation, histological investigation, and morphometric analysis indicated that the natural biological functional scaffold retained more bFGF at the injury site, guided axon growth, and promoted nerve regeneration as well as functional restoration.",

Methods Between January 2004 and December 2010, 36 patients(5 women and 30 men; mean age, 51.7 ± 12.9 years) with Stanford type B AD underwent endovascular repair. They were followed up by telephone calls at 1, 6, 12 months and then annually after discharge, moreover, regular computed tomography angiography(CTA) was performed. The effects of treatment and complications were analyzed. Results The technical success rate was 100%. Type I endoleak and neurological syndrome occurred in 4 and 1 case, respectively. Neither complication of paraplegia nor lower limb ischemia occured. 34 cases (94.4%) were followed up for a mean time of 25.7 ± 25.1 months. CTA demonstrated that false lumen enlarged insignificantly and thrombus formed in false lumen. Four patients (11.8%) died during the follow-up. Conclusions Stent-graft treatment of Stanford type B AD is effective. It can relieve symptoms and reduce in-hospital mortality significantly. However, long-term results remain to be further observed.",

Several functional regions including Nogo-66 were identified to mediate the inhibitory effect of Nogo-A. We have reported that Nogo-66 could promote neural progenitors to differentiate into glial cells. Here we exam three other regions of Nogo-A and show two of them also mediate the differentiation of neural progenitors. A 172-residues N-terminal region and a 37-residues C-terminal region of Nogo-A both could inhibit neuronal differentiation and promoted glial cell formation. This study illustrated that Nogo-A had multiple functional domains on the behavior of neuronal cells. The inhibitory effect of neural differentiation of Nogo-A may also contribute to its restraint of CNS repair.",

Based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a method for designing a reliable fuzzy controller is presented. The resulting fuzzy control systems are reliable in the sense that asymptotic stability is achieved not only when all control components are operating well, but also in the presence of some component failures. A reliable fuzzy control design scheme via state feedback is proposed in terms of LMIs. The result is extended to the case of observer-based reliable fuzzy control. Two illustrative examples are given to illustrate the validity of the proposed design procedures.",

        "abstract": "In this brief, we investigate the reliability issues of MOSFETs with bulk 28-nm technology for its possible application in resistive-type nonvolatile memory (RNVM). The impact of electrical stress on transistors when working in the 1T1R array cells is discussed. It is found that the high source–drain voltage bias during the 1T1R array operation is the main reason causing the MOSFET degradation. Furthermore, by comparing the electrical characteristics of MOSFETs with different channel lengths, it is confirmed that the degradation is caused by high-energy electrons drifting from the source side to the drain end under a high electric field. As a result, this issue will be more serious as the gate length continues to scale down. An ultralow operation voltage RNVM is required for a better lifetime if RNVM is embedded in sub-28-nm technologies.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To observe the effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on expressions of MCP-1 and CD68 in renal tubulointerstitial injury of diabetic rats and explore the mechanism of MMF's protective role. Methods: Diabetes was induced in uninephrectomized male Wistar rats by peritoneal injection of STZ (65 mg·kg-1). Rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group (NC), diabetic group (DM) and treated group (DM + MMF) with MMF (15 mg·kg-1·d-1). This study lasted for 8 weeks. 24 h urinary protein, blood glucose and the ratio of left kidney weight/body weight were determined after 8 weeks. The renal tubulointerstitial morphological change was observed, immunohistochemical method was used to analyze expressions of MCP-1 protein and CD68. Expression of MCP-1 mRNA in renal tissue was measured by quantitative Real-time PCR. Results: Compared with NC group, serum glucose level, 24 hour urinary protein and the ratio of left kidney weight/body weight were significantly increased (P < 0.01), and the relative area of interstitial fibrosis was also significantly enlarged in DM group (P < 0.01); Expressions of MCP-1 protein, CD 68 and MCP-1 mRNA were significantly upregulated in DM group (P < 0.01), but parameters mentioned above, except serum glucose and serum creatinine, were all significantly inhibited in MMF group (P < 0.05 or 0.01). Conclusions: MMF plays an apparent protection on renal tubulointerstitial injury, which is probably associated with down-regulation of MCP-1 expression.",

The sub-μA switching current and self-selection nonlinear I–V characteristics are attributed to the SiO 2  interfacial layer rather than the decrease of conductive filament (CF) size and oxygen vacancy (V O ) density, which can be verified by HRTEM and measured conduction behavior. Therefore, robust reliability property is also achieved.

It is known that heparin could be immobilized onto scaffolds to enhance their binding of growth factors with the heparin-binding domain. Here, we crosslinked heparin to DBM to increase its BMP-2 binding ability. To our surprise, the mechanical strength of DBM was also dramatically increased. The compression modulus of heparin crosslinked DBM (HC-DBM) have improved (seven-fold increased) under wet condition, which would allow the scaffolds to keep specific shapes in vivo. As expected, HC-DBM showed specific binding ability to BMP-2. Additional studies showed the bound BMP-2 exerted its function to induce cell differentiation on the scaffold. Subcutaneous implantation of HC-DBM carrying BMP-2 showed higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (2 weeks), more calcium deposition (4 and 8 weeks) and more bone formation than that of control groups. It is concluded that HC-DBM has increased mechanical intensity as well as specific BMP-2 binding ability; HC-DBM/BMP-2 enhances the osteogenesis and therefore could be an effective medical device for bone repair.",

        "abstract": "To analyze the clinical manifestations and the diagnosis of the facial nerve tumor according to the clinical information, and evaluate the different surgical approaches depending on tumor location.Twenty-seven cases of facial nerve tumors with general clinical informations available from 1999.9 to 2006.12 in the Shanghai EENT Hospital were reviewed retrospectively.Twenty (74.1%) schwannomas, 4 (14.8%) neurofibromas ,and 3 (11.1%) hemangiomas were identified with histopathology postoperatively. During the course of the disease, 23 patients (85.2%) suffered facial paralysis, both hearing loss and tinnitus affected 11 (40.7%) cases, 5 (18.5%) manifested infra-auricular mass and the others showed some of otalgia or vertigo or ear fullness or facial numbness/twitches. CT or/and MRI results in 24 cases indicated that the tumors originated from the facial nerve. Intra-operative findings showed that 24 (88.9%) cases involved no less than 2 segments of the facial nerve, of these 24 cases 87.5% (21/24) involved the mastoid portion, 70.8% (17/24) involved the tympanic portion, 62.5% (15/24) involved the geniculate ganglion, only 4.2% (1/24) involved the internal acoustic canal (IAC), and 3 cases (11.1%) had only one segments involved. In all of these 27 cases, the tumors were completely excised, of which 13 were resected followed by an immediate facial nerve reconstruction, including 11 sural nerve cable graft, 1 facial nerve end-to-end anastomosis and 1 hypoglossal-facial nerve end-to-end anastomosis. Tumors were removed with preservation of facial nerve continuity in 2 cases.Facial nerve tumor is a rare and benign lesion, and has numerous clinical manifestations. CT and MRI can help surgeons to make a right diagnosis preoperatively. When and how to give the patients an operation depends on the patients individually.",

In this study, a combinatorial approach combining the PLGA nerve conduits and the recombinant human neurotrophin-3 (rhNT3) was utilized in a spinal cord injury animal model. After complete transection of the thoracic cord in rats, rhNT3 was administered as a single dose to the host cord caudal to a 2-mm conduit. Axonal regrowth was enhanced, as indicated by immunostaining and neurofilament-positive area measurement. Neural regrowth was further demonstrated via the retrograde tracing across the lesion. The animals implanted with the PLGA scaffold and rhNT3 exhibited significantly improved performance in BBB rating scale and grid walk tests. These observations suggest that PLGA nerve conduits combined with exogenous NT3 may serve as an alternative therapeutic approach for spinal cord injury repair.",

Methods Thirty-one renal recipients receiving 1.0 g of mycophenolate mofetil twice daily were included in this study. The MPA AUC for time 0~12 h (MPA AUC_ 0-12 ) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule, including 10 timed MPA concentrations. Correlation analysis between MPA AUC_ 0-12 and each timed MPA concentration were performed to identify the predictable time points of MPA AUC_ 0-12 , multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine limited sampling approaches.Results The best correlations between MPA AUC_ 0-12 and concentrations at various time points were found at 0.5 h (C_ 0.5 ,γ=0.6004),1 h (C_1,γ=0.6044), 4 h (C_4,γ= 0.6121 ) and 10 h(C_ 10 ,γ=0.6371)(all P<0.001). The regression equation for AUC estimation was established as MPA AUC=12.61+ 0.37 C_ 0.5 + 0.49C_1+ 3.22C_4+8.17C_ 10 . There exists good agreement between predicted AUC and the full MPA AUC_ 0-12 , 26 of 31(84) prediction error were within 10,30 of 31(97) prediction error were within 20.Conclusion This limited sampling strategy provides an effective approach for estimation of full MPA AUC_ 0-12h in renal recipients.",

Methods: The deletion of the gene sequence encoding for the 11 amino acids at the carboxyl terminal of pneumolysin (PN) from its wild type gene (pn) by PCR resulted in a mutant pneumolysin gene (pnd). The wild type pn gene encoding PN and the mutant gene (pnd) encoding PND were cloned into pVAX1 vector respectively and then tested as Ppn and Ppnd DNA vaccines. The PN and PND proteins were purified from recombinant E. coli. Rhesus macaques were immunized by intramuscularly (i. m.) injection of Ppn or Ppnd DNA vaccine with electroporation (EP). Results: Because of the deletion of the gene sequence encoding for the eleven amino acids at the carboxyl terminal of the PN from pn gene, the recombinant PND antigen lost its hemolytic activity while its antigenicity was remained. The specific humoral immunity against pneumolysin was induced by injecting monkey with 500 μg DNA followed by EP. Boosting the Ppn or Ppnd DNA/EP primed animals with corresponding recombinant protein, PN or PND, evoked strong immune response at about 4 fold increase in the antibody titer. Conclusion: Specific antibody responses were induced in the monkeys by DNA vaccination and electroporation. The immunogenicity of the DNA vaccines were significantly enhanced when PN or PND protein boost was applied 10 d after third DNA vaccination.",

The delay and lost packets caused by the handoff process affect the network quality of service. Taking subway wireless communication system as an application scenario, the number of channels used is reduced, which decreases the scan delay effectively. An algorithm called Layer2-Buff is proposed to solve the problem of lost packets, which sets up buffers for STA, and used to save data that cannot be sent successfully. Test results show that Layer2-Buff reduces the packet loss rate to zero in an automatic train control system, and extra delay to the network is tolerable.

        "abstract": "We cultured bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells by a simple ex vivo expansion method and observed the expansion efficacy. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from five mongrel adult dogs were cultured with EGM-2MV medium in culture flasks coated with fibronectin. Morphology was observed with phase contrast microscopy, and a growth curve was constructed to evaluate the efficacy of expansion. Incorporation of Dil-ac-LDL was tested to evaluate the function. At different time points, immunocytochemical staining for flk-1, CD133, and factor VIII-related antigens was done and compared to staining of endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells and percentages of CD133, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), and the double-positive cells measured with flow cytometry to identify the quality and efficacy of expansion. Cluster-like attached cells grew to confluence at an average time of 10 days, and the mean number of cells harvested from 1 mL of bone marrow was (1.3 +/- 0.3) x 10(6). The cells presented a cobblestone-like appearance and took up Dil-ac-LDL. Immunocytochemistry showed that flk-1, CD133, and factor VIII-related antigens were positive. Flow cytometry showed that VEGFR-2 and CD133 double-positive cells augmented 242-fold at the tenth day. Ex vivo expansion can effectively proliferate endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow; the expansion efficacy could meet the requirements for tissue engineering of blood vessels.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of adaptive neural tracking control is considered for a class of single-input/single-output (SISO) strict-feedback stochastic nonlinear systems with input saturation. To deal with the non-smooth input saturation nonlinearity, a smooth nonaffine function of the control input signal is used to approximate the input saturation function. Classical adaptive technique and backstepping are used for control synthesis. Based on the mean-value theorem, a novel adaptive neural control scheme is systematically derived without requiring the prior knowledge of bound of input saturation. It is shown that under the action of the proposed adaptive controller all the signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood around the origin in the sense of mean quartic value. Two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented results.",

        "abstract": "Three new isomeric pyridine-containing diarylethenes with a benzofuran moiety were synthesized, and the structures of two diarylethenes were determined by single X-ray diffraction analysis. Their properties such as photochromism, acidchromism, fluorescence, as well as electrochemical properties, were investigated in detailed. The diarylethenes exhibited multi-addressable switching behavior by light and acid/base stimuli in solution and functioned as a remarkable fluorescent switch in both solution and poly(methyl methacrylate) films. Among these isomeric derivatives, the example with the nitrogen atom at the ortho-position of pyridine showed the largest absorption maxima, molar absorption coefficients, and cyclization quantum yield. The nitrogen atom position in the terminal pyridine unit could efficiently modulate the optical and electrochemical properties of the diarylethenes with a benzofuran moiety. The results suggested that the benzofuran moiety and the nitrogen atom position in the terminal pyridine unit played a vital role during the process of photoisomerization reaction for these isomeric diarylethenes. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The new pervious concrete (PC) were prepared using magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) as binding and waste steel slag as coarse aggregate. A series of laboratory experiments were carried out to study the influence of aggregate size and molding method on the compressive strength, flexural strength, porosity and water permeability coefficient of magnesium phosphate cement steel slag pervious concrete (MSPC). Experimental results showed that the influence of aggregate size on compressive strength is different when different molding methods were adopted. Through comparative analysis, the MSPC with medium particle size formed by vibration molding had the highest compressive strength, and the maximum can reach 41.5 MPa. Based on the excellent bonding strength of MPC, the MSPC has better flexural strength than traditional PC, and the maximum 28-day flexural strength can reach 8.0 MPa. The porosity increases with the increase of aggregate size, and which is in the range of 23.8–26.5% for all the MSPC mixtures. Similarly, the water permeability coefficient of MSPC increases as the increase of aggregate size, and with the range from 5.85 to 7.10 mm/s. The 28-day bend-press ratio of MSPC is close to 1/5. Unlike the traditional PC, the mechanical strength of MSPC increased first and then decreased with the porosity, while regardless of aggregate size and molding method, the water permeability coefficient increased linearly with the porosity. The test results indicate that the MSPC made of steel slag aggregates and MPC is a very promising eco-friendly PC.",

By constructing parameter-dependent Lyapunov functional, some sufficient conditions are developed to enable robust exponential mean square stability for the systems. New parameter-dependent robust stability criteria for MJLSs are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be solved efficiently by the interior-point algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide and tends to have drug resistance. Delicaflavone (DLF), a novel anticancer agent of biflavonoid from Selaginella doederleinii Hieron, showed strong anti-CRC activities, which has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the effects and possible anti-CRC mechanism of DLF in vitro and in vivo. It was shown that DLF significantly inhibited the cells viability and induced G2/M phase arrest, apoptosis, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), generation of ROS and increase of intracellular Ca in HT29 and HCT116 cells by MTT assay, TEM, flow cytometry and inverted fluorescence microscope. Western blot and qPCR assays results further confirmed DLF induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/MEK/Erk signaling pathways in CRC cells. Meanwhile, DLF significantly suppressed the tumor growth via activation of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 protein and decrease of ki67 and CD34 protein without apparent side effects in vivo. In summary, these results indicated DLF induced ROS-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through ER stress and mitochondrial pathway accompanying with the inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/MEK/Erk signaling cascade. Thus DLF could be a potential therapeutic agent for CRC.",

        "abstract": "NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To gain insight into its clinical significance, NOTCH1 mutation was investigated in 77 patients with T-ALL.Detection of NOTCH1 mutation was done using reverse transcription-PCR amplification and direct sequencing, and thereby compared according to the clinical/biological data of the patients.Thirty-two mutations were identified in 29 patients (with dual mutations in 3 cases), involving not only the heterodimerization and proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine domains as previously reported but also the transcription activation and ankyrin repeat domains revealed for the first time. These mutations were significantly associated with elevated WBC count at diagnosis and independently linked to short survival time. Interestingly, the statistically significant difference of survival according to NOTCH1 mutations was only observed in adult patients (>18 years) but not in pediatric patients (< or = 18 years), possibly due to the relatively good overall response of childhood T-ALL to the current chemotherapy. NOTCH1 mutations could coexist with HOX11, HOX11L2, or SIL-TAL1 expression. The negative effect of NOTCH1 mutation on prognosis was potentiated by HOX11L2 but was attenuated by HOX11.NOTCH1 mutation is an important prognostic marker in T-ALL and its predictive value could be even further increased if coevaluated with other T-cell-related regulatory genes. NOTCH pathway thus acts combinatorially with oncogenic transcriptional factors on T-ALL pathogenesis.",

We investigated a collagen based targeting system for bladder regeneration. A collagen binding domain was added to the native basic fibroblast growth factor N-terminal to allow it to bind to collagen.Sprague-Dawley rats underwent partial cystectomy. Collagen scaffolds loaded with collagen binding domain basic fibroblast growth factor, native basic fibroblast growth factor or phosphate buffered saline were grafted to the remaining host bladders, respectively. At days 30 and 90 reconstructed bladders were evaluated by histological analysis and urodynamics.This targeting basic fibroblast growth factor delivery system induced satisfying bladder histological structures. It promoted more vascularization and smooth muscle cell ingrowth. Urodynamics revealed well accommodated bladder tissue with volume capacity and compliance.Results show that the targeting delivery system consisting of collagen binding domain basic fibroblast growth factor and collagen membranes induced better bladder regeneration at the injury site. Thus, this targeting delivery system may be an effective strategy for bladder regeneration with potential clinical applications.",

The results showed that the nitrogen content increased with nitrogen level. The correlation between 14 kinds of selected parameters based on hyperspectral data of diffeled periods and plant nitrogen content was significantly different. The use of the soil nitrogen content model that established with spectral parameters P_Area 1100、Depth 980、Area 672、PPR (550,540) in four key developmental stages showed a higher prediction accuracy. It can be concluded that using spectra spectro-scopic methods to monitor soil nitrogen content are feasible.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the carrier transport characteristics of the ultrascaled Si FinFETs. Traditional dc characterization technique is compared with the ultrafast pulsed IV method. Due to the severe self-heating effect introduced in the characterization process, the ballistic transport parameters extracted using dc method would show essential discrepancies from those in the real high-speed IC circuits. Therefore, an ultrafast pulsed IV measurement technique is proposed for accurate ballistic transport characterization. Furthermore, since the series resistance (   ${R}_{{textbf {SD}}}$   ) of the Si FinFETs is temperature-dependent, a modified backscattering model is adopted to extract the ballistic transport parameters without the influence of the temperature-variant    ${R}_{{textbf {SD}}}$   . A ballisticity scaling model was established to predict the scalability of the ballistic transport parameters. It is found that very high ballisticity could be achieved for FinFETs with sub-10-nm technology nodes.",

        "abstract": "We report the involvement of an evolutionarily conserved set of mycobacterial genes, the esx-3 region, in evasion of bacterial killing by innate immunity. Whereas high-dose intravenous infections of mice with the rapidly growing mycobacterial species Mycobacterium smegmatis bearing an intact esx-3 locus were rapidly lethal, infection with an M. smegmatis Δesx-3 mutant (here designated as the IKE strain) was controlled and cleared by a MyD88-dependent bactericidal immune response. Introduction of the orthologous Mycobacterium tuberculosis esx-3 genes into the IKE strain resulted in a strain, designated IKEPLUS, that remained susceptible to innate immune killing and was highly attenuated in mice but had a marked ability to stimulate bactericidal immunity against challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis. Analysis of these adaptive immune responses indicated that the highly protective bactericidal immunity elicited by IKEPLUS was dependent on CD4+ memory T cells and involved a distinct shift in the pattern of cytokine responses by CD4+ cells. Our results establish a role for the esx-3 locus in promoting mycobacterial virulence and also identify the IKE strain as a potentially powerful candidate vaccine vector for eliciting protective immunity to M. tuberculosis.

BMSCs were efficiently seeded onto gelatin microspheres in a spinner flask to form BGMs with a high cell density. CBD-BMP2 was recombined and bound with collagen microfibers to form CCMs, in which BMP2 was controllably released. BGM and CCM were assembled as building blocks to fabricate macroscopic bone-like constructs in vitro and in vivo, where BMSCs were directly induced to differentiate into osteocytes. The osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was confirmed with increasing mineral deposition (alkaline phosphatase stain, alizarin red stain, calcium content and micro-CT), gene expression of osteogenic markers (alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and collagen type I) as well as alkaline phosphatase activity. The in vivo formed bone-like tissues had the compression modulus of 2.62 ± 1.41 MPa, similar to that in the in vivo bone tissues, much higher than those in BGM samples of 0.03 ± 0.012 MPa. Our results suggesting these proof-of-concept strategies, assembling cell-culture modules and function-control modules to modularly engineer clinical-relevant large tissue replacements, have great potential applications in tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of the adaptive neural control for a class of a perturbed pure-feedback nonlinear system. Based on radial basis function (RBF) neural networks' universal approximation capability, an adaptive neural controller is developed via the backstepping technique. The proposed controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the tracking error eventually converges to a small neighborhood around the origin. The main advantage of this note lies in that a control strategy is presented for a class of pure-feedback nonlinear systems with external disturbances being bounded by functions of all state variables. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

        "abstract": "The Tarim Desert Highway is 562 km in length, and it passes through the Taklimakan Desert, the second largest mobile desert in the world, in which a road section with a length of 442.5 km passes through the mobile desert. Along the Tarim Desert Highway, the conditions are characterized by the extremely severe ecological environment, little precipitation, violent evaporation, high annual and daily temperature ranges, long sunshine duration, and frequent occurrence of sand drift disasters. According to the meteorological data observed by Tazhong Meteorological Station, the days of occurring strong winds (≥17.2m/s), floating dusts and blowing sands are 6, 74 and 45 days respectively; the annual temperature, maximum temperature in August and minimum temperature in January are 12.7°C, 43.2°C and-19.3°C respectively; the annual precipitation and evaporation are 10.7 mm and 3 806.4 mm respectively; and the annual sunshine duration is 2 854.2 hours. In this paper, the physical and chemical properties of aeolian sandy soil under the different local conditions along the Tarim Desert Highway are preliminarily researched. The results show that the aeolian sandy soil along the highway is mainly composed of the extremely fine sand and fine sand; the pH value varies in a range of 8～9; the spatial difference of salt content is significantly; the contents of nutrients and organic matter are low and their spatial difference is not so obvious; the contents of microelements (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) are universally low.",

Although the faint magnitude limit of the\nSDSS allows us to detect RR Lyrae stars to large galactocentric distances\n(about 100 kpc, or r = 21), we find no candidates fainter than r = 20, i.e.\nfurther than about 65 kpc from the Galactic center. On the assumption that all\n148 candidates are indeed RR Lyrae stars (contamination by other species of\nvariable star is probably less than 10%), we find that their volume density has\nroughly a power-law dependence on galactocentric radius, 1/R^(2.7+-0.2),\nbetween 10 and 50 kpc, and drops abruptly at R = 50-60 kpc, possibly indicating\na sharp edge to the stellar halo as traced by RR Lyrae stars.\n  The Galactic distribution of stars in this sample is very inhomogeneous and\nshows a clump of over 70 stars at about 45 kpc from the Galactic center. This\nclump is also detected in the distribution of nonvariable objects with RR Lyrae\nstar colors. When sources in the clump are excluded, the best power-law fit\nbecomes consistent with the 1/R^3 distribution found from surveys of bright RR\nLyrae stars. These results imply that the halo contains clumpy overdensities\ninhomogeneously distributed within a smooth 1/R^3 background, with a possible\ncutoff at about 50 kpc.",

        "abstract": "OCT4 is one of the key transcription factors in maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Human OCT4 can generate two isoforms OCT4A and OCT4B by alternative splicing. OCT4B1 is a recently discovered novel OCT4 spliced variant, which has been considered as a putative marker of stemness. Compared with the OCT4B mRNA, OCT4B1 mRNA is generated by retaining intron 2 as a cryptic exon which contains a TGA stop codon in it. As a result, the protein product of OCT4B1 mRNA could be truncated. Interestingly, we present here that OCT4B1 can indirectly produce the same protein products as OCT4B. We have demonstrated that OCT4B1 mRNA can be spliced into OCT4B mRNA, and encode three protein isoforms. The splicing of OCT4B1 mRNA into OCT4B mRNA can be remarkably inhibited by the mutation of the classical splicing site. Our result suggests that OCT4B mRNA may originate from OCT4B1 mRNA by alternative splicing.",

When combined with growth factors, they could accelerate bone formation. Here, we explore a collagen containing mineralized bone-derived matrix (CCMBM) from bovine bone tissues, which not only maintains proper mechanical strength but also binds to the collagen-binding recombinant human collagen-binding bone morphogenetic protein-2 (CBD-BMP(2)). By analyzing its morphology and composition, we found that CCMBM was porous and mainly composed of calcium compounds. CCMBM could provide mechanical support for bone injury repair. It also showed good biocompatibility and proper degradation rate that would be helpful for bone regeneration. In addition, the intentionally preserved collagen allowed the specific binding of CBD-BMP(2) to CCMBM, and resulted in significantly increased osteogenesis in vivo. The results indicated that the combination of CCMBM with collagen-binding BMP(2) could be emerged into an effective medical device for bone repair.",

It was found that the relative notch depth significantly influenced AE characteristics. The occurrence of AE events decreased greatly with an increase of the relative notch depth. The influences of different fibers in concrete on AE characteristics were investigated as well. The experimental results indicated that the Weibull function can be used to describe quantitatively the influences of the relative notch depth and fibers on AE characteristics, fracture characteristics, and brittleness of concrete. The two parameters, θ and m , of the Weibull function depended on the geometry of the concrete specimens and the brittleness of concrete, respectively.",

Human OCT4 gene can generate three mRNA isoforms (OCT4A, OCT4B, and OCT4B1) by alternative splicing and four protein isoforms (OCT4A, OCT4B-265, OCT4B-190, and OCT4B-164) by alternative splicing or alternative translation initiation. OCT4A is a transcription factor responsible for the stemness of ESCs, while the function of OCT4B protein isoforms is still not clear. We have previously reported that OCT4B-190 functioned in cell stress response. Here, we present another product of OCT4 gene, OCT4B-265, which is upregulated under genotoxic stress in stem cells, and it may function in stress response through p53 signaling pathway. This work gives an insight into the novel function of OCT4B protein isoforms and helps us to understand the complex expression patterns and biological functions of OCT4 gene.",

To overcome the design difficulty from nondifferential saturation nonlinearity, a smooth nonlinear function of the control input signal is first introduced to approximate the saturation function; then, an adaptive fuzzy tracking controller based on the mean-value theorem is constructed by using backstepping technique. The proposed adaptive fuzzy controller guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability and the system output eventually converges to a small neighborhood of the desired reference signal in the sense of mean quartic value. Simulation results further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",

However, guiding bFGF to pulmonary vascular endothelial cells is a key determinant for the success of bFGF therapy. To improve the lung-targeting ability of bFGF, a lung endothelial cell-targeting peptide was fused to bFGF (LET-bFGF). An in vitro biological activity assay indicated that fusion of LET did not affect the bioactivity of bFGF. In addition, the fused protein showed superior lung-targeting ability following intravenous injection. Upon injecting LET-bFGF intravenously after thorax radiation, LET-bFGF could better protect against pulmonary vascular endothelial cell apoptosis as early as 4 h post-radiation. Compared with native bFGF, enhanced therapeutic effects of LET-bFGF were also observed in terms of decreased vascular abnormalities, disorganized lung structure, inflammatory cell migration, and lung density at 2 months post-radiation. Therefore, lung endothelial cell-targeted bFGF may represent a promising remedy for RILI.",

        "abstract": "Nerve conduit provides a promising strategy for nerve injury repair in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, simply bridging the transected nerve with an empty conduit is hard to satisfy functional recovery. The regenerated axons may disperse during regeneration in the empty lumen, limiting the functional recovery. Our previous work had reported that linear ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) could be used as a nerve guidance material. Here we cross-linked LOCS fibers with laminin which was a major component of the extracellular matrix in nervous system. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) plays a critical role in peripheral nerve regeneration. But the lack of efficient CNTF delivery approach limits its clinical applications. To retain CNTF on the scaffold, a laminin binding domain (LBD) was fused to the N-terminal of CNTF. Compared with NAT-CNTF, LBD-CNTF exhibited specific laminin-binding ability and comparable neurotrophic bioactivity. We combined LBD-CNTF with the laminin modified LOCS fibers to construct a double-functional bio-scaffold. The functional scaffold was filled in silicon conduit and tested in the rat sciatic nerve transection model. Results showed that this functional biomaterial could guide the axon growth, retain more CNTF on the scaffolds and enhance the nerve regeneration as well as functional recovery.",

        "abstract": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common heart valve disorder, yet its mechanism remains poorly understood. Valve interstitial cells (VICs) are the prevalent cells in aortic valve and their osteogenic differentiation may be responsible for calcific nodule formation in CAVD pathogenesis. Emerging evidence shows microRNA (miRNA, or miR) can function as important regulators of many pathological processes, including osteogenic differentiation. Here, we aimed to explore the function of miR-449c-5p in CAVD pathogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated the role of miR-449c-5p in VICs osteogenesis. MiRNA microarray assay and qRT-PCR results revealed miR-449c-5p was significantly down-regulated in calcified aortic valves compared with non-calcified valves. MiR-449c-5p overexpression inhibited VICs osteogenic differentiation in vitro, whereas down-regulation of miR-449c-5p enhanced the process. Target prediction analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed Smad4 was a direct target of miR-449c-5p. Furthermore, knockdown of Smad4 inhibited VICs osteogenic differentiation, similar to the effect observed in up-regulation miR-449c-5p. In addition, animal experiments proved indirectly miR-449c-5p could alleviate aortic valve calcification. Our data suggested miR-449c-5p could function as a new inhibitory regulator of VICs osteogenic differentiation, which may act by targeting Smad4. MiR-449c-5p may be a potential therapeutic target for CAVD.",

The main clinical presentations were dizziness, headache, vertigo, and visional dysfunction. Variated degree of artery stenoses in the 4 arteries (bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries) were revealed by color doppler ultrasonography and DSA. Eight patients underwent aorto-bi-subclavian arteries prosthetic graft bypass. Three patients underwent aorto-bi-subclavian artery prosthetic graft bypass and graft-unilateral carotid artery bypass with autologous great saphenous vein. Three patients underwent aorta-unilateral subclavian artery-unilateral carotid artery prosthetic graft bypass. Two patients underwent aorta carotid artery bypass with autologous great saphenous vein, of which one patient underwent aortocoronary artery bypass simultaneously. Cerebral blood supply was monitored in 14 patients with transcranial doppler. Unilateral subclavian carotid and femoral carotid artery shunt was used respectively to avoid cerebral ischemia during operation in 2 patients.Symptoms and signs of cerebral ischemia improved in all patients with effective rate of 100% apart from deflected tongue-protrusion in 3 patients which recovered in 2 weeks after operation. All patients survived and no symptoms recurred at the end of a 2.2 year's follow-up. Unfortunately, two patients developed aneurysm at the anastomosis within 4 years after operation.Arterial reconstruction is an effective method for Takayasu's disease with severe cerebral ischemia. TCD monitoring plays an important role during the bypass operation. It can help to determine the revision of blood pressure and prevent postoperative brain reperfusion injury.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence has indicated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a critical role in cancer development. However, only a small number of circRNAs have been experimentally validated and functionally annotated. In this study, using a high-throughput microarray assay, we identified a novel circRNA, circKDM4C, which was downregulated in breast cancer tissues with metastasis. Furthermore, we analyzed a cohort of breast cancer patients and found that circKDM4C expression was decreased in breast cancer tissues, and lower circKDM4C expression was associated with poor prognosis and metastasis in breast cancer. Functionally, we demonstrated that circKDM4C significantly repressed breast cancer proliferation, metastasis, and doxorubicin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, using a dual-luciferase activity assay and AGO2 RNA immunoprecipitation, circKDM4C was identified as a miR-548p sponge. We also found that PBLD was a direct target of miR-548p, which functioned as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Moreover, miR-548p overexpression was able to reverse the circKDM4C-induced attenuation of malignant phenotypes and elevated expression of PBLD in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our data indicate that circKDM4C might have considerable potential as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, and support the notion that therapeutic targeting of circKDM4C/miR-548p/PBLD axis may be a promising treatment approach for breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper evaluates the effect of silica fume (SF) and basalt fibers (BF) on the mechanical properties and microstructure of magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) mortar. Several MPC mortar mixtures with different contents of SF and BF were prepared. Experimental results revealed that the compressive strength and flexural strength of MPC mortar was increased by increasing the percentages of SF from 0% to 10%. Incorporation of BF improved the flexural strength and post-peak flexural behaviour of the load-deflection curve of MPC mortars, but its effect on the compressive strength was insignificant. MPC matrix with 10%SF and 0.5%BF demonstrated the highest compressive and flexural strength of 49.42 MPa and 5.31 MPa respectively at the 28 days. XRD and SEM analysis showed that control mixture without SF and BF contained more unreacted magnesia and struvite as compared to MPC mortars containing SF and BF. Moreover, SEM-EDS analysis of MPC mixtures incorporating SF and BF showed that SF and fly ash (FA) reacted within the MPC paste system to produce the secondary hydration products. It was postulated that magnesium silicate, aluminium or silicon phosphate phases were formed during the reaction of SF and FA in the MPC system. These secondary products tend to improve the bonding of solid phase and hence mechanical properties of MPC mortar. Finally, SEM-EDS analysis also confirmed the excellent interaction of BF with the MPC hydration products.",

The switched systems under consideration are composed of some subsystems in non-strict -feedback form. It is assumed that all the system state variables are unavailable, but the output variable is measurable. A switched nonlinear observer is set up to estimate those unmeasurable state variables. Convex combination method is utilized to determine the observer gain matrix so that the effect from those nonlinear terms can be well compensated for. By the feature of the basis vector functions of radial basis neural networks (RBF NN), a new observer-based adaptive neural backstepping control design scheme is presented for the switched nonlinear non-strict feedback systems. The multiple Lyapunov method is used to show the stability of the adaptive closed-loop systems. It is also proven that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood around the original point under the action of the suggested controllers. Finally, a simulation example is studied to test the efficacy of the suggested control strategies.",

        "abstract": "OCT4 and NANOG are two important transcription factors for maintaining the pluripotency and selfrenewal abilities of embryonic\n stem (ES) cells. Meanwhile they play key roles in the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. In this study, recombinant transcript\n factors TAT-NANOG and TAT-OCT4, which contained a fused powerful protein transduction domain (PTD) TAT from human immunodeficiency\n virus (HIV), were produced. Each fusion protein could be transported into human adult fibroblasts (HAF) successfully and activated\n the endogenous transcription of both nanog and oct4. Our study revealed the inter-regulation and autoregulation abilities of solo oct4 or nanog in the process of iPS cell reprogramming. Meanwhile the transduction of TAT-NANOG could accelerate the growth rate of HAF\n cells, and the key cell cycle regulator cdc25a was up-regulated. Thus cdc25a may be involved in the regulation of cell growth by NANOG. In addition, the TAT fusion protein technology provided a novel\n way to improve cell growth that is more controllable and safer.",

        "abstract": "Serum cystatin C (CysC) has been identified as a possible potential biomarker in a variety of diabetic complications, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy and peripheral artery disease. We aimed to examine the association between CysC and diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). 411 patients with T2D were enrolled in this cross-sectional study at a university hospital. Clinical manifestations and biochemical parameters were compared between DFU group and non-DFU group. The association between serum CysC and DFU was explored by binary logistic regression analysis. The cut point of CysC for DFU was also evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The prevalence of coronary artery disease, diabetic nephropathy (DN), and DFU dramatically increased with CysC ( < 0.01) in CysC quartiles. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the significant risk factors for DFU were serum CysC, coronary artery disease, hypertension, insulin use, the differences between supine and sitting TcPO, and hypertension. ROC curve analysis revealed that the cut point of CysC for DFU was 0.735 mg/L. Serum CysC levels correlated with DFU and severity of tissue loss. Our study results indicated that serum CysC was associated with a high prevalence of DFU in Chinese T2D subjects.",

        "abstract": "Mandibular defects, caused by congenital, pathological or iatrogenic insults, can significantly affect patient quality of life. The reconstruction of mandible has recently gained the interest of clinical and tissue engineering researchers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of three-dimensional (3-D) cultured autologous grafts prepared using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) combined with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) scaffolds for the restoration of mandibular defects. Cylindrical defects were created in the mandibular body of minipigs and filled with 3D-cultured BMSCs/DBM autografts, 2D-cultured BMSCs/DBM autografts, DBM material (without cells), or were left unfilled (blank). Using computed tomographic (CT) imaging and histological staining, we found that treatment of mandibular defects using 3-D cultured BMSCs/DBM autografts offered improvements in bone formation over both 2-D cultured autografts and cell-free DBM scaffolds. We found increased osteoid formation in 3D and 2D cultures, with more osteogenic cells present in the 3D constructs. We suggest that 3-D cultured homograft BMSCs combined with DBM scaffolds represents a new strategy for bone reconstruction, with potential future clinical applicability.",

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the uncertain nonlinearities and backstepping technique is utilized to construct an adaptive fuzzy controller.

For those with commonly seen localized lesions, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting is the first-line treatment. Treatment methods for severely ill patients in whom intervention has failed, or those in a poor general condition, are worth exploring. From February 2002 to July 2008, 31 patients were referred to us. Eighteen patients had a failed intervention, 4 had undergone surgery, and 10 had conservative therapy. All had intractable ascites or/and hematemesis. The procedures carried out in this series included mesocavoatrial shunt in 10 patients, radical correction in 9, mesocavojugular shunt in 7 (including 2 mesojugular shunts), mesocaval shunt in 2, cavoatrial shunt in 2 (including a revision of cavoatrial shunt), and cavojugular shunt in 1. Surgical mortality and postoperative complications were both 3.2%. Twenty-eight patients had a mean follow-up of 40 months. Outcome of follow-up was measured as excellent, good, fair, poor, and death (28.6%, 53.6%, 10.7%, 3.6%, and 3.6%, respectively). The total mortality of the group is 6.5%. After appropriate preoperative evaluation and preparation, active and cautious treatment individualized to the underlying disease may help severely ill patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome.",

        "abstract": "The behaviour of square concrete-fi lled steel tube columns under concentrical loading was studied. More than one hundred specimens were tested to investigate the effects of thickness of steel tube on the load carrying capacity of the concrete-fi lled tubular columns (CFTs). The effect of the grade of concrete and content of expansive agent were also investigated. The effect of these parameters on the confi nement of the concrete core was studied as well. From the experimental study it was found that for both CFTs with different strength grade concrete core, the ultimate load carrying capacity increases with the increase in percentage of expansive agent up to 20% but it again decreases at 25% of expansive agent content. It was also shown that the failure mode of CFTs depends on the strength grade of concrete core. © 2011 Wuhan University of Technology and Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Many studies have been focusing on the functional improvement after OEC implantation in spinal cord injury of animals. However, little is known about the mechanisms about how OECs respond to the proapoptotic microenvironment after transplantation. We use the hypoxia and serum deprivation (HSD) paradigm in OECs to evaluate the effects of the ischemic damage. OECs underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis during HSD and a pan-caspase inhibitor specifically blocked the cell death. In addition, HSD resulted in a time-dependent decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential DeltaPsi(m), triggering a transient increase in p53 content and activated p53 in a time-dependent manner. In summary, our data suggest that HSD trigger apoptotic OECs death, which may be related to mitochondria dysfunction and the dependence of p53.",

        "abstract": "It had been demonstrated that stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) could promote in situ tendon regeneration by recruiting endogenous cells. However, native SDF-1α diffuses too fast in vivo, reducing its local concentration and efficacy. In this study, we prepared a recombinant SDF-1α containing a collagen-binding domain (CBD-SDF-1α) and developed a functional collagen scaffold by tethering CBD-SDF-1α on the collagen scaffold for in situ tendon regeneration. CBD-SDF-1α could induce the migration of mesenchymal stem cells, dermal fibroblasts and Achilles tendon fibroblasts in vitro, and achieve controlled release from the collagen scaffold. In a rat Achilles tendon defect model, the functional scaffold could increase the recruitment of CXCR4 positive fibroblast-like cells and the deposition of Tenascin-C at 7 days after implantation. After 4 and 12 weeks, the functional collagen scaffold could promote the expression of type I collagen, increase the diameters of collagen fibrils and improve the mechanical properties of regenerated tendons. Hence, the functional scaffold increased the efficacy of tendon regeneration by controlling release of SDF-1α, enhancing the recruitment of fibroblast-like cells and providing instructive microenvironment and mechanical support for tendon regeneration. Therefore, CBD-SDF-1α-modified collagen scaffold could serve as a practical application for tendon regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Deficient vascularization is one of the prominent shortcomings of porous tissue-engineering scaffolds, which results in insufficient oxygen and nutrients transportation. Here, heparin cross-linked demineralized bone matrices (HC-DBM) pre-loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were designed to promote cells and new microvessels invasion into the matrices. After being chemical crosslinked with heparin by N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-(3-di-methylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide, the scaffold could bind more VEGF than the non-crosslinked one and achieve localized and sustained delivery. The biological activity of VEGF binding on heparinized collagen was demonstrated by promoting endothelial cells proliferation. Evaluation of the angiogenic potential of heparinized DBM loaded with VEGF was further investigated by subcutaneous implantation. Improved angiogenesis of heparinized DBM loaded with VEGF was observed from haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry examination. The results demonstrated that heparin cross-linked DBM binding VEGF could be a useful strategy to stimulate cells and blood vessels invasion into the scaffolds.",

The simulation results illustrate that all the state variables of the system can quickly converge to a small neighborhood of the origin under the action of an input signal,and the proposed fuzzy adaptive controller not only stabilizes the active isolator system but also keeps all of the adaptive signals to be bounded.The approach developed in this paper ensures that the active vibration isolation system has a good performance of vibration isolation.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the synchronization problems for an array of neural networks with hybrid coupling and interval time-varying delay. First, a novel augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) method is proposed to develop delay-dependent synchronization criteria for the networks, which makes use of more relaxed conditions by employing the new type of augmented matrices with Kronecker product operation. The proposed method can handle a multitude of Kronecker product operations in the LKF and alleviates the requirements of the positive definiteness of some conditional matrices which are usually considered in the existing methods for complex networks. This leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the synchronization criteria, i.e., less conservative synchronization results can be obtained. Meanwhile, the case of fast time-varying delay can also be handled by the proposed method. Furthermore, based on the derived criteria, a robust synchronization criterion is obtained for the system with uncertainties both in coefficient and coupling matrix terms. Since an expression based on linear matrix inequality is used, the proposed criteria can be easily checked in practice. Finally, numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of nitrate-mediated souring control highly depends on the interactions of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and nitrate reducing bacteria (NRB). Biosurfactants produced by natural NRB are promising bio-agents for enhancing NRB competence towards SRB. However, the function of NRB-produced biosurfactants in NRB-SRB interactions remains unexplored due to the rarely successful isolation of natural biosurfactant-producing NRB. Hereby, biosurfactant-aided inhibitory control of SRB strain Desulfomicrobium escambiense ATCC 51164 by biosurfactant-producing NRB strain Pseudomonas stutzeri CX3, reported in our previous work, was investigated. Under non-sour conditions, insufficient nitrate injection resulted in limited SRB inhibition. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers traced the overall bacterial responses. Compositional PLFA patterns revealed biosurfactant addition benefitted both SRB and NRB towards stressful conditions. Under sour conditions, nitrite oxidation of sulfide proved to be the primary mechanism for sulfide removal. The subsequent elevation of redox potential and pH inhibited SRB activities. NRB-produced biosurfactants significantly enhanced SRB inhibition by NRB through more efficient sulfide removal and effective duration of nitrate in the microcosms. Biosurfactants specially produced by the NRB strain are for the first time reported to significantly strengthen SRB inhibition by NRB via reduced nitrate usage and prolonged effective duration of nitrate, which has encouraging potential in nitrate-dependent souring control.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into endothelial cells. The effect of shear stress on MSC differentiation is incompletely understood, and most studies have been based on two-dimensional systems. We used a model of tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) to investigate the effects of shear stress on MSC differentiation.MSCs were isolated from canine bone marrow. The TEVG was constructed by seeding MSCs onto poly-epsilon-caprolactone and lactic acid (PCLA) scaffolds and subjecting them to shear stress provided by a pulsatile bioreactor for four days (two days at 1 dyne/cm(2) to 15 dyne/cm(2) and two days at 15 dyne/cm(2)).Shear stress significantly increased the expression of endothelial cell markers, such as platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), VE-cadherin, and CD34, at both the mRNA and protein levels as compared with static control cells. Protein levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and calponin were substantially reduced in shear stress-cultured cells. There was no significant change in the expression of alpha-SMA, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) or calponin at the mRNA level.Shear stress upregulated the expression of endothelial cell-related markers and downregulated smooth muscle-related markers in canine MSCs. This study may serve as a basis for further investigation of the effects of shear stress on MSC differentiation in TEVGs.",

All the patients had limb edema and pain, sixteen had limb cyanochroia(one had calf skin ulcer and foot gangrene), two had limb pallor, ten had weakened dorsalis pedis artery pulsation, eight had silent dorsalis pedis artery pulsation. Colour Doppler ultrasonography revealed DVT and superficial venous thrombosis in all diseased limbs. One patient underwent above knee amputation for limb gangrene. Seventeen underwent surgical thrombectomy, of which three were simple thrombectomy, five were supplemented with suprapubic saphenous vein bypass, six with suprapubic PTFE graft bypass, three with iliac vein lysis angioplasty.One patient died (5.6%) on the third day after surgery. Limb edema relieved in seven patients (41.2%), reduced in ten patients (58.8%). All diseased limbs regained normal artery pulsation and skin appearance except for one limb amputated. Sixteen patients (94.1%) were followed up by a mean of 34 months. Limb edema disappeared in five patients (31.3%), reduced in eight patients (50%), recurrent in three patients (18.7%). Among three recurrent patients, one died of malignant tumor 9 months after operation, two had their graft occluded resulting from intimal hyperplasia.Surgical thrombectomy is an effective method for treating severe acute DVT in lower extremity.",

        "abstract": "Recently, with the development of the space program there are growing concerns about the influence of spaceflight on tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was thus to determine the variations of neural stem cells (NSCs) during spaceflight. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) based transcriptomic profiling of NSCs identified many differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs between space and earth groups. Subsequently, those genes with differential expression were subjected to bioinformatic evaluation using gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) and miRNA-mRNA network analyses. The results showed that NSCs maintain greater stemness ability during spaceflight although the growth rate of NSCs was slowed down. Furthermore, the results indicated that NSCs tended to differentiate into neuron in outer space conditions. Detailed genomic analyses of NSCs during spaceflight will help us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind their differentiation and proliferation when they are in outer space.",

        "abstract": "Sciatic nerve injuries often cause partial or total loss of motor, sensory and autonomic functions due to the axon discontinuity, degeneration, and eventual death which finally result in substantial functional loss and decreased quality of life. Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a critical role in peripheral nerve regeneration. However, the lack of efficient NGF delivery approach limits its clinical applications. We reported here by fusing with the N-terminal domain of agrin (NtA), NGF-beta could target to nerve cells and improve nerve regeneration.Laminin-binding assay and sustained release assay of NGF-beta fused with NtA (LBD-NGF) from laminin in vitro were carried out. The bioactivity of LBD-NGF on laminin in vitro was also measured. Using the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model, the nerve repair and functional restoration by utilizing LBD-NGF were tested.LBD-NGF could specifically bind to laminin and maintain NGF activity both in vitro and in vivo. In the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model, we found that LBD-NGF could be retained and concentrated at the nerve injury sites to promote nerve repair and enhance functional restoration following nerve damages.Fused with NtA, NGF-beta could bind to laminin specifically. Since laminin is the major component of nerve extracellular matrix, laminin binding NGF could target to nerve cells and improve the repair of peripheral nerve injuries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This research is mainly concerned with the consensus tracking problem for a class of high-order non-strict feedback nonlinear multi-agent systems, in which the virtual and the actual control items of each follower dynamics are the power functions with positive odd integers rather than linear items. Due to this structural feature of the high-order systems, adding a power integrator technique is employed in controller design to overcome the obstacle caused by high power of virtual and real control items. Meanwhile, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks are used to approximate the uncertain nonlinearities. An adaptive tracking strategy is proposed for this type of multi-agent systems. It is shown that the suggested control scheme can guarantee the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals and ensure that all outputs of follower agents track the leader signal synchronously. Since high-order non-strict feedback nonlinear multi-agent systems include some existing nonlinear multi-agent systems as the special case, our result can be used to control more general nonlinear multi-agent systems. Finally, a numerical example is presented to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the biocompatibility of 3 kinds of artificial, biodegradable graft materials, including T20 [Poly (butylene terephthalate)-co-poly (cyclohexylene dimethanol terephthalate)-b-poly (ethylene glycol)], PHBV (Poly3-hydroxybutyrate-Poly3-hydroxyvalerate) and PEGT/PBT [Poly (butylene terephthalate)/poly (ethylene glycol) terephthalate], and to study their effects on canine smooth muscle cells(SMCs) growth after surface modification. Methods: The contact angles were measured to compare the hydrophilicity of T20, PHBV, and PEGT/PBT scaffolds. Then SMCs were cultivated on these biodegradable scaffolds; their proliferation and growth were assayed by MTT assay, FITC and electron microscopic observation for evaluation of their in vitro biocompatibility. The growth of SMCs was also assayed on the 3 scaffolds after they were pretreated with gelatin or Poly-1-lysine. Results: The contact angles of 3 scaffolds were all less than 90°(PEGT/PBT>T20>PHBV). MTT assay showed that SMCs adhered to and grew well on T20, PHBV, and PEGT/PBT scaffolds. The cell viability began to increase 24 h after cultivation (PEGT/PBT>T20>PHBV, P<0.01), followed by a decrease, but increased again 72 h after cultivation (T20>PEGT/PBT>PHBV, P<0.01). FITC observation showed that SMCs grew well and electron microscopic observation showed a confluent growth of SMCs with abundant extracellular matrix. The viability of SMCs was significantly higher on scaffolds pretreated with gelatin or Poly-1-lysine than on those without pretreatment(P<0.01). Conclusion: T20, PHBV, PEGT/PBT have good in vitro biocompatibility; the scaffolds made of these materials can obviously improve cell attachment after surface modification.",

        "abstract": "Although in situ restoration of blood supply to the infarction region and attenuating pre-existing extracellular matrix degradation remain potential therapeutic approaches for myocardial infarction (MI), local delivery of therapeutics has been limited by low accumulation (inefficacy) and unnecessary diffusion (toxicity). Here, a dual functional MI-responsive hydrogel is fabricated for on-demand drug delivery to promote angiogenesis and inhibit cardiac remodeling by targeting upregulated matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 (MMP-2/9) after MI. A glutathione (GSH)-modified collagen hydrogel (collagen-GSH) is prepared by conjugating collagen amine groups with GSH sulfhydryl groups and the recombinant protein GST-TIMP-bFGF (bFGF: basic fibroblast growth factor) by fusing bFGF with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and MMP-2/9 cleavable peptide PLGLAG (TIMP). Specific binding between GST and GSH significantly improves the amount of GST-TIMP-bFGF loaded in collagen-GSH hydrogel. The TIMP peptide enclosed between GST and bFGF responds to MMPs for on-demand release during MI. Additionally, the TIMP peptide is a competitive substrate of MMPs that inhibits the excessive degradation of cardiac matrix by MMPs after MI. GST-TIMP-bFGF/collagen-GSH hydrogels promote the recovery of MI rats by enhancing vascularization and ameliorating myocardium remodeling. The results suggest that on-demand growth factor delivery by synchronously controlling binding and responsive release to promote angiogenesis and attenuate cardiac remodeling might be promising for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of delay-dependent robust stochastic stability analysis and controller synthesis for Markovian jump systems with state and input delays. It is assumed that the delays are constant and unknown, but their upper bounds are known. By constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and introducing some appropriate slack matrices, new delay-dependent stochastic stability and stabilization conditions are proposed by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An important feature of the results proposed here is that all the robust stability and stabilization conditions are dependent on the upper bound of the delays. Memoryless state feedback controllers are designed such that the closed-loop system is robustly stochastically stable. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the effect of hot carrier injection (HCI) on the ballistic transport characteristics of SOI MOSFETs for the first time. Ballistic efficiency is an important indicator of device performance for nanoscale transistors. In the process of HCI stress, the traps and defects generated in the transistor channel would increase the carrier scattering and therefore degrade the ballistic efficiency. The effect of this degradation changes with gate length. In addition, due to low thermal conductivity of the oxide layer and high on-state current for nanoscale transistors, the SOI MOSFETs suffer from severe self-heating effect (SHE) which would affect the accurate evaluation of HCI effects on the ballistic carrier transport. Ultrafast pulse measurement were employed in this study to exempt the SHE from the characterization process, yielding more realistic results for the reliability estimation on device ballisticity.",

Based on the Mamdani-type fuzzy logic system online approximation capability, a direct adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is developed by using the backstepping approach. The proposed design scheme guarantees that all the signals in the resulting closed-loop system are uniform ultimate bounded, and the tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin. In addition, the number of the online adaptive parameters is not more than the order of the considered system and the possible controller singularity problem is removed by introducing the modified integral Lyapunov functions. Finally, two simulation examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",

In this paper, the phytochemical components of the total biflavonoids extract from  were studied by using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-QTOF MS/MS) in negative ion mode, and their in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects were evaluated. Four types of biflavonoids from , including IC3'-IIC8'', IC3'-IIC6'', IC3'-IIC3''', and C-O linked biflavonoids were examined originally using QTOF MS/MS. The fragmentation behavior of IC3'-IIC3''' linked biflavonoids was reported for the first time. A total of twenty biflavonoids were identified or tentatively characterized and eight biflavonoids were found from  for the first time. Furthermore, the 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thizolyl)-2,5-diphenyltertazolium bromide (MTT) assay and xenograft model of mouse lewis lung cancer(LLC) in male C57BL/6 mice revealed favorable anticancer properties of the total biflavonoids extracts from . The results of this work could provide useful knowledge for the identification of biflavonoids in herbal samples and further insights into the chemopreventive function of this plant.",

By the condition of variable partition, a new fuzzy adaptive backstepping is proposed for such a class of nonlinear MIMO systems. The suggested fuzzy adaptive controller guarantees that the proposed control scheme can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking errors eventually converge to a small neighborhood around the origin. The main advantage of this paper is that a control approach is systematically derived for nonlinear systems with strong interconnected terms which are the functions of all states of the whole system. Simulation results further illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach.",

The original systems can be generalized to augmented systems, then some admissible conditions for fuzzy descriptor systems are obtained based on a new fuzzy Lyapunov function and new fuzzy controller. For the admissible conditions of open-loop systems, the subsystems are not required to be admissible, nor the multiplied term of input control matrix by control gain matrix has to be considered in the admissible conditions of closed-loop systems. By virtue of the property of membership function, the H∞ control conditions are improved. Furthermore, some strict linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained. At last, some examples are given to illustrate that the obtained sufficient conditions are less conservative than the results given by previous literature.",

To improve blood compatibility, a shear-resistant confluent monolayer endothelium was formed on the luminal surface of the conduit. Under mechanical stimulation induced by pulsatile flow in a bioreactor, abrupt high-flow shear stress of 15.3 +/- 4.6 dynes/cm2 was applied to endothelial cells (ECs) seeded onto the lumen of a living-tissue conduit after 2 days of static culture. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that most of the ECs were washed off after 3 days of dynamic culture. When shear stress was increased stepwise from 1.5 +/- 0.8 to 15.3 +/- 4.6 dynes/cm2 and applied to the ECs, scanning electron microscopy images of the luminal surface revealed that the confluent monolayer ECs were highly elongated and oriented to the flow direction, similar to findings in natural arteries in vivo. The results indicated that in vitro flow conditions played a key role in determining the durability of the EC layer. Careful design of the bioreactor and careful selection of the culture conditions will greatly improve the chances of producing a useful anti-thrombogenic surface for tissue-engineered small-diameter vessels.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we systematically study the mass spectra and strong decays of 1P and 2S charmed and charmed-strange baryons in the framework of non-relativistic constituent quark models. With the light quark cluster–heavy quark picture, the masses are simply calculated by a potential model. The strong decays are studied by the Eichten–Hill–Quigg decay formula. Masses and decay properties of the well-established 1S and 1P states can be reproduced by our method. (Sigma _c(2800)^{0,+,++}) can be assigned as a (Sigma _{c2}(3/2^-)) or (Sigma _{c2}(5/2^-)) state. We prefer to interpret the signal (Sigma _c(2850)^0) as a (2S(1/2^+)) state although at present we cannot thoroughly exclude the possibility that this is the same state as (Sigma _c(2800)^0). (Lambda _c(2765)^+) or (Sigma _c(2765)^+) could be explained as the (Lambda _c^+(2S)) state or (Sigma ^+_{c1}(1/2^-)) state, respectively. We propose to measure the branching ratio of (mathcal {B}(Sigma _c(2455)pi )/mathcal {B}(Sigma _c(2520)pi )) in the future, which may disentangle the puzzle of this state. Our results support (Xi _c(2980)^{0,+}) as the first radial excited state of (Xi _c(2470)^{0,+}) with (J^P=1/2^+). The assignment of (Xi _c(2930)^0) is analogous to (Sigma _c(2800)^{0,+,++}), i.e., a (Xi ^prime _{c2}(3/2^-)) or (Xi ^prime _{c2}(5/2^-)) state. In addition, we predict some typical ratios among partial decay widths, which are valuable for experimental search for these missing charmed and charmed-strange baryons.",

Whole-genome sequencing was performed in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from eight cases of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), the high-risk subtype of MDS. The nucleotide substitution patterns were found similar to those reported in AML, and mutations of 96 protein-coding genes were identified. Clonal architecture analysis revealed the presence of subclones in six of eight cases, whereas mutation detection of CD34(+) versus CD34(-) cells revealed heterogeneity of HSPC expansion status. With 39 marker genes belonging to eight functional categories, mutations were analyzed in 196 MDS cases including mostly RAEB (n = 89) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) (n = 95). At least one gene mutation was detected in 91.0% of RAEB, contrary to that in RCMD (55.8%), suggesting a higher mutational burden in the former group. Gene abnormality patterns differed between MDS and AML, with mutations of activated signaling molecules and NPM1 being rare, whereas those of spliceosome more common, in MDS. Finally, gene mutation profiles also bore prognostic value in terms of overall survival and progression free survival.",

The basic physical property was studied, the dynamic 3 mm wave attenuation capability was tested for the chip. Based on the radar scatter cross section theory of millimeter wave interference materials, the analysis and estimation result for skin depth, surface resistivity, heat wastage resistance of the chip shows that the absorption attenuation makes up about 35.6% of the total attenuation and is obviously superior to that of chaff. The calculation results of extinction parameters of the chip in 3 mm waveband by the Mie theory show that the absorption is leading factor at smaller partial size parameter k; the scattering is leading factor at bigger k; the absorption makes up 42% of the total attenuation at half wavelength (particle size 2r = 1.5 mm).",

Their pre-and post-implantation audiometry data including pure-tone audiometry (PTA), auditory steady-state responses (ASSR), auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were retrospectively analyzed, in order to compare the change between pre- and post-implantation residual hearing.Among the 12 recipients who had some measurable residual hearing before implantation, 5 (41.6%) patients had conserved some measurable hearing but the other 7 (58.4%) recipients had lost all measurable hearing after implantation on the implanted side. The implanted ears had an average PTA threshold drop of 9.5 dB HL and a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-implantation (P < 0.05) PTA thresholds in the frequencies of 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz. Compared to non-implanted ears, the drop in 500 Hz and 1kHz had a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-implantation PTA thresholds (P < 0.05). The ASSR residual hearing threshold elevation were statistically significant (P < 0.05) between pre- and post-implantation ASSR at 250 Hz and 500 Hz on the implanted side, while the The ASSR residual hearing threshold elevation were statistically significant (P < 0.05) at 500 Hz when compared to non-implanted side. The difference of residual hearing between pre- and post-implantation was not statistically significant for both DPOAE and ABR.There will be a certain degree of damage to residual hearing of the implanted side following REZ-I cochlear implantation.",

Anyway the stability of mixed production line is the most important problem for capacity planning. Therefore the whole status and the key vertices should be obtained by means of topological characteristics of network architecture. And then the capacity redundancy and resources configuration will be planned in order to avoid the catastrophic failure of the whole production line due to accidental disable of vertices. Finally, an actual production was introduced as an example.

        "abstract": "To develop a collagen-based wound targeting repair system, we introduced two collagen-binding domains (CBDs) into the human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Three expression vectors were constructed: the first one (named V-bFGF) contained bFGF and the CBD WREPSFCALS derived from von Willeband's factor (vWF); the second (named C-bFGF) contained bFGF and the CBD TKKTLRT derived from collagenase; the third (named bFGF) was bFGF as a control. The recombinant proteins of V-bFGF and C-bFGF were demonstrated to retain both growth factor activity and collagen-binding activity. We found that C-bFGF possessed higher collagen-binding ability than V-bFGF. The targeted repair systems consisting of collagen scaffolds and CBD-bFGFs were assembled in vitro and then implanted subcutaneously. Results showed that C-bFGF promoted vascularization at the implanted sites more effectively than V-bFGF. Histological analysis showed more cells migrated into collagen scaffolds incorporated with C-bFGF than those with V-bFGF. These data suggested that the higher collagen-binding ability the CBD-bFGF possessed, the more significant vascularization, and cellularization were observed. In summary, CBD-bFGF/collagen system could be used as a targeted repair system with beneficial effects of the restriction of bFGF diffusion, the prolonging of bFGF activity, and the targeted promotion of vascularization and cellularization.",

The porous scaffolds not only induced the diversification of cell morphologies but also extended cell proliferation. The expression of pro-angiogenic growth factors and the transcriptions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were significantly increased in cells cultured in 3D collagen scaffolds. In addition, 3D collagen scaffolds could generate a cell population with the properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The upregulation of EMT markers and the downregulation of the epithelial cell marker were observed in cells cultured in collagen scaffolds. The expression of stem cell markers, including OCT4A and SOX2, and breast cancer stem cell signatures, including SOX4, JAG1 and CD49F, was significantly unregulated in 3D collagen scaffolds. The proportion of cells with CSC-like CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) phenotype was notably increased. High-level expression of CSC-associated properties of MCF-7 cells cultured in 3D was further confirmed by high tumorigenicity in vivo. Moreover, xenografts with 3D cells formed larger tumors. The properties of MCF-7 cells in 3D may have partially simulated their in vivo behaviors. Thus, 3D collagen scaffolds might provide a useful platform for anti-cancer therapeutics and CSC research.",

        "abstract": "Stem cells and biomaterials transplantation hold a promising treatment for functional recovery in spinal cord injury (SCI) animal models. However, the functional recovery of complete SCI patients was still a huge challenge in clinic. Additionally, there is no clinical standard procedure available to diagnose precisely an acute patient as complete SCI. Here, two acute SCI patients, with injury at thoracic 11 (T11) and cervical 4 (C4) level respectively, were judged as complete injury by a stricter method combined with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nerve electrophysiology. Collagen scaffolds, named NeuroRegen scaffolds, with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were transplanted into the injury site. During 1 year follow up, no obvious adverse symptoms related to the functional scaffolds implantation were found after treatment. The recovery of the sensory and motor functions was observed in the two patients. The sensory level expanded below the injury level, and the patients regained the sense function in bowel and bladder. The thoracic SCI patient could walk voluntary with the hip under the help of brace. The cervical SCI patient could raise his lower legs against the gravity in the wheelchair and shake his toes under control. The injury status of the two patients was improved from ASIA A complete injury to ASIA C incomplete injury. Furthermore, the improvement of sensory and motor functions was accompanied with the recovery of the interrupted neural conduction. These results showed that the supraspinal control of movements below the injury was regained by functional scaffolds implantation in the two patients who were judged as the complete injury with combined criteria, it suggested that functional scaffolds transplantation could serve as an effective treatment for acute complete SCI patients.",

The specimens were analyzed by mechanical tests, histological observation and superficial study. The intra-abdominal implantation of the silicone tubes readily stimulated the development of the biotubes. The biotubes consisted of collagen-rich extracellular matrices. Myofibroblasts appeared as elongated cells with circumferential or longitudinal orientations. Subsequent to one month of embedding, the thickness of the tube wall was 70-250 μm. The burst strength was 1100±187 mmHg and the suturability was excellent. Biotubes that have the ability to be widely variable in their shapes are composed of autologous cells and glomerular extracellular matrices. Biotubes are ideal grafts for tissue engineering as they are able to avoid immunological rejection and are of sufficient mechanical strength.",

        "abstract": "In acute promyelocytic leukemia, granulocytic differentiation is arrested at the promyelocyte stage. The variant t(11;17) translocation produces two fusion proteins, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-retinoic acid receptor α (PLZF-RARα) and RARα-PLZF, both of which participate in leukemia development. Here we provide evidence that the activity of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), a master regulator of granulocytic differentiation, is severely impaired in leukemic promyelocytes with the t(11;17) translocation compared with those associated with the t(15;17) translocation. We show that RARα-PLZF inhibits myeloid cell differentiation through interactions with C/EBPα tethered to DNA, using ChIP and DNA capture assays. Furthermore, RARα-PLZF recruits HDAC1 and causes histone H3 deacetylation at C/EBPα target loci, thereby decreasing the expression of C/EBPα target genes. In line with these results, HDAC inhibitors restore in part C/EBPα target gene expression. These findings provide molecular evidence for a mechanism through which RARα-PLZF acts as a modifier oncogene that subverts differentiation in the granulocytic lineage by associating with C/EBPα and inhibiting its activity.",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in UGT1A9-118(dT)(9)/(10), UGT1A9 T-440C/C-331T, UGT1A8*3, UGT2B7 G211T, UGT2B7 C802T, ABCC2 C-24T, and ABCC2 G1249A were detected. A total of 46 recipients were enrolled in the pharmacokinetics study at day 30 after kidney transplantation. Differences in the MPA pharmacokinetic profiles confirmed large inter-patient variation of MPA exposure. A statistical significant increase in the dose-adjusted AUC(6-12) level of MPA was found in patients bearing the -118(dT)(10) allele of the UGT1A9 gene (T(9) = 7.34 +/- 4.11 mg h ml(-1) g(-1); T(9)/T(10) = 11.54 +/- 7.62 mg h ml(-1) g(-1); and T(10) = 11.89 +/-8.76 mg h ml(-1) g(-1), p = 0.041). A similar trend was also observed for the dose-adjusted AUC(0-12) and AUC(6-12) of MPAG. Patients carrying the heterozygous mutant alleles of ABCC2 G1249A exhibited higher AUC(6-12)/D of AcMPAG than those with wild-type genotype (p = 0.016). The other SNPs that were genotyped did not cause any significant variation in MPA and MPAG pharmacokinetic parameters. In conclusion, the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA in the patients seems to be more extensive in UGT1A9-118(dT)(10) allele carriers, and the exposure of AcMPAG is higher in patients carrying ABCC2 G1249A genotype than those with wild-type genotype.",

Part process information was stored by feature-based description method. Based on this, a process association searching algorithms was designed to extract association between processes. An analysis and forecasting model for multistage manufacturing quality was constructed based on partial least square regression. Some principal components which were major influencing factors on multistage manufacturing quality were extracted by partial least square regression. Then, the multi-collinearity among processes could be solved and the forecasting precision of multistage manufacturing quality model could be improved greatly. Finally, a case study on bush machining was given to demonstrate the above-mentioned ideas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The number of patients with knee impairments caused by a stroke, spinal cord injury, post-polio, injury, osteoarthritis, or other related diseases is increasing worldwide. Robotic devices such as knee exoskeletons have been studied and adopted in gait rehabilitation, as they can provide effective gait training for the patients and release the physical therapists from the intensive labor required by the traditional physical therapy. In addition, knee exoskeletons can augment human performance in normal walking, loaded walking, and even running by enhancing the strength of the wearers’ knee joints. A systematic review of knee exoskeletons is presented in this paper. The biomechanics of the human knee joint is firstly presented. Then, the design concepts of knee exoskeletons, including the actuators and sensors, are provided, followed by the introduction of the corresponding control strategies. Finally, the limitations of the available devices and the research and development directions in the field of knee exoskeletons are discussed, thus providing useful information to the researchers developing knee exoskeletons that are suitable for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis claims more human lives each year than any other bacterial pathogen. Infection is maintained in spite of acquired immunity and resists eradication by antimicrobials. Despite an urgent need for new therapies targeting persistent bacteria, our knowledge of bacterial metabolism throughout the course of infection remains rudimentary. Here we report that persistence of M. tuberculosis in mice is facilitated by isocitrate lyase (ICL), an enzyme essential for the metabolism of fatty acids. Disruption of the icl gene attenuated bacterial persistence and virulence in immune-competent mice without affecting bacterial growth during the acute phase of infection. A link between the requirement for ICL and the immune status of the host was established by the restored virulence of delta icl bacteria in interferon-gamma knockout mice. This link was apparent at the level of the infected macrophage: Activation of infected macrophages increased expression of ICL, and the delta icl mutant was markedly attenuated for survival in activated but not resting macrophages. These data suggest that the metabolism of M. tuberculosis in vivo is profoundly influenced by the host response to infection, an observation with important implications for the treatment of chronic tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "To compare the efficacy, cost and safety of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) versus open surgery in the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms.Retrospective analyses were conducted for the clinical data and follow-up information of 218 cases from January 2002 to December 2011 at our hospital. Open surgery group included 86 patients with an mean age of 65.5 years and a mean aneurysm diameter of 5.4 cm. In EVAR group, there were 132 cases with an average age of 76.8 years and a mean aneurysm diameter of 5.6 cm.Among 86 open cases, there were inverted \"Y\" type artificial graft (n = 83) and straight artificial graft (n = 3). The surgical success rate was 98.8%, perioperative period mortality rate was 2.3%, a mean volume of blood loss 450 ml and a mean transfusion volume 320 ml. The mean operative duration was 230 min, a mean hospitalization time (30 ± 3) days and a mean hospitalization cost RMB yuan 58 000. In EVAR group, the surgical success rate was 100% and perioperative period mortality rate 0.8%. Separating stent graft (n = 121, 91.7%), straight stent graft (n = 4, 3%) and one-stent-graft (n = 7, 5.3%). The mean operative duration was 150 min, a mean volume of blood loss 140 ml, a mean hospitalization time 15.5 days and a mean hospitalization cost RMB yuan 104 800. The operative duration, volume of blood loss and length of hospital stay of EVAR group were superior to those of open surgery group (P < 0.05). But the cost of group EVAR was significantly higher than that of group open surgery (P < 0.05). In group open surgery, 80 cases (94.1%) received a mean follow-up period of 46 months. And 79 artificial grafts maintained patency (98.8%) and 8 cases died (10%). There were 125 cases in group EVAR (94.7%) with a mean time of 32.5 months; stent graft patency in 120 cases (96%), 10 death; 8 complication cases (5.6%) involved stent migration (n = 2) and iliac artery branch occlusion (n = 6). Long-term effects had no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). In terms of the incidence of complications, group EVAR was significantly more than group open surgery (P < 0.05).In terms of operative duration, volume of blood loss and length of hospital stay, EVAR and open surgery treatment for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms group EVAR is significantly better than group open surgery. As far hospitalization cost, group EVAR is significantly higher than group open surgery. But, in terms of incidence of long-term complications, group EVAR is significantly higher than group open surgery while the latter often requires further interventions.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) promotes angiogenesis after myocardial infarction (MI), but its biological functions decrease in the event of diffusion, enzymolysis, and weak binding with co-receptors in vivo. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are a major component of extracellular matrices and have been shown to regulate a wide range of cellular functions and bioprocesses by acting as a co-receptor for bFGF and affecting its bioactivities. However, the influence of HSPG on the function of bFGF after myocardial infarction is unknown. Here, exogenous HSPG along with bFGF was injected into the hearts of rats to deliver the angiogenic growth factor for ischemic heart repair following induced MI. The specific binding of HSPG with bFGF protein was demonstrated, which was about 6-fold stronger than the binding of bFGF with heparin. The biological mechanisms of HSPG binding with bFGF were further studied by cell adhesion assay, and assays of bFGF and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activities demonstrated that HSPG enhances cell adhesion, promotes the bioactivity of bFGF in angiogenesis, and protects bFGF from enzymolysis. Our results indicate that HSPG has potential clinical utility as a delivery agent for heparin-binding growth factors. Additionally, HSPG shows high binding affinities with different ECM proteins which also help to anchor bFGF to heart tissue. Therefore, extracellular proteins that mimic the bio-scaffold of the extracellular matrix could promote the activities of bFGF to facilitate ischemic heart repair.",

        "abstract": "Many Liriomyza species are pests of agricultural and ornamental plants. In the past two decades, the occurrence and distribution of certain Liriomyza species have changed dramatically, leading to an extensive body of research papers. First, we review the association of thermal tolerance with population dynamics, geographic distribution, and species displacement. Differences in thermal tolerances between species result in their differential geographic locations and overwintering ranges. Displacements among Liriomyza species are associated with their temperature adaptation. We examine the chemical linkage of plants, Liriomyza, and their parasitoids. Chemical compounds from host and nonhost plants mediate the behavior of Liriomyza and their parasitoids. Liriomyza and their parasitoids use chemical cues to locate their hosts. Induced compounds can be used as attractants of parasitoids or repellents of Liriomyza. Thus, understanding the thermal tolerances and chemical ecology of Liriomyza may enable researchers to predict geographic distribution and to develop novel control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Five unsymmetrical diarylethenes with a naphthalene moiety were synthesized, and the structures of four diarylethenes were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The naphthalene was connected directly to the central perfluorocyclopentene ring as an aryl moiety and available to participate in photoisomerization reaction. Their properties, such as photochromism, thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and fluorescence, were investigated systematically. All five diarylethenes, which are thermally stable, exhibit favorable photochromism, and function as notable fluorescence switches in both solution and solid media. The electron-donating substituents effectively suppressed the cycloreversion quantum yield, whereas the electron-withdrawing substituents evidently enhanced the fluorescence quantum yield of diarylethenes with a naphthalene moiety. The results indicated that the naphthalene moiety and the substituent effects played an important role during the process of photoisomerization reaction for these diarylethene derivatives. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

But the diffuse of BMPs into muscle tissues around bone injury sites often leads to heterotopic ossification, which has been regarded as one of major side-effects of BMP implementation in bone defect patients. It raises great demands for exploring effective methods that preventing BMP-induced heterotopic ossification while not interrupting the osteoinductive activity of BMPs for in situ bone defect repair. Here we found insulin, a positive regulator for bone regeneration, inhibited BMP2-induced muscle heterotopic ossification by suppressing the expression of bone transcription factor Osterix. By analyzing downstream molecules of insulin pathway, we found AKT/mTOR/GSK3 signaling was responsible for the inhibition of insulin on BMP2-induced ossification, and GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 attenuated BMP2-induced muscle heterotopic ossification. The data might shed light on developing effective clinical therapy for inhibiting muscle heterotopic ossification when BMPs were used bone defect repair.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper is concerned with the problem of the stability and stabilization for continuous-time Takagi–Sugeno(T–S) fuzzy systems with time delay. A novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional which includes fuzzy line-integral Lyapunov functional and membership-function-dependent Lyapunov functional is proposed to investigate stability and stabilization of T–S fuzzy systems with time delay. In addition, switching idea which can avoid time derivative of membership functions is introduced to deal with derivative term. Relaxed Wirtinger inequality is employed to estimate integral cross term. Sufficient stability and stabilization criteria are derived in the form of matrix inequalities which can be solved using the switching idea and LMI method. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with some recent works.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the potential role and the mechanism of PLZF-RARalpha/RARalpha-PLZF double fusion gene in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in vivo at systematic biological level, PLZF-RARalpha/RARalpha-PLZF double transgenic mouse model was established by intercross; the integration and expression of fusion genes were analyzed by PCR and RT-PCR; the disease phenotype was detected by morphological and pathological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells, as well as flow cytometry assays; the effects of ATRA with or without tricostatin A on bone marrow blast cells from PLZF-RARalpha/RARalpha-PLZF double TM were observed. The results showed that leukemia occurred in 5 PLZF-RARalpha/RARalpha-PLZF double TM 7, 7, 9, 11 and 11 months respectively, out of them two (40%) with classic APL features, the others (60%) with chronic myeloid leukemia through an observation period of 18 months. The leukemia occurrence of PLZF-RARalpha/RARalpha-PLZF TM was about 10%, which was similar to PLZF-RARalpha TM as that reported before. The latency was over 6 months, not earlier than PLZF-RARalpha TM only. No morphologic changes of PLZF-RARalpha/RARalpha-PLZF double TM blast cells to ATRA were observed, but increased cytoplasmic-nuclear ratio and nuclear condensation in bone marrow blast cells were found in combination of ATRA with tricostatin A. It is concluded that PLZF-RARalpha/RARalpha-PLZF double fusion gene transgenic mice have heterogeneity of pathogenesis. HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A, in combination with ATRA, induce differentiation of the blast/promyelocytic cells from PLZF-RARa/RARa-PLZF double TM, but not ATRA alone.",

The delay caused by handoff process affects the quality of service (QoS), such as real-time applications like VoIP. In order to resolve this problem, an improved fast handoff algorithm is proposed to confirm, authorize and connect the next AP. According to the moving speed and excursion angle, a threshold value of distance and received signal strength (RSS) is determined between mobile nodes (MNs) and the connecting AP. This algorithm has been used in a signal system of subway. The test results show that the delay caused by handoff process is reduced and the probability of success handoff is increased.",

Upon irradiation with 254 nm UV light, their color changed from colorless to blue, in which absorption maxima were observed at 590 nm and 592 nm in CH 2Cl2. DTE-1 and DTE-2 also showed relatively strong fluorescence in different solvents when excited at 295 nm. While, their fluorescence spectra showed remarkable concentration dependence.

Based on this new method,a stable path based MAODV (SP-MAODV) multicast routing protocol was given with a stable path selection and less hops. The simulation results on data packet transmission rate,routing overhead,average end-to-end delay and delay jitter show that the new protocol reduces interruption probability of the path and improves performance of the protocol.",

        "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to substantial disability due to loss of motor function and sensation below the lesion. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are a promising strategy for SCI repair. However, NSCs rarely differentiate into neurons; they mostly differentiate into astrocytes because of the adverse microenvironment present after SCI. We have shown that myelin-associated inhibitors (MAIs) inhibited neuronal differentiation of NSCs. Given that MAIs activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, we used a collagen scaffold-tethered anti-EGFR antibody to attenuate the inhibitory effects of MAIs and create a neuronal differentiation microenvironment for SCI repair. The collagen scaffold modified with anti-EGFR antibody prevented the inhibition of NSC neuronal differentiation by myelin. After transplantation into completely transected SCI animals, the scaffold-linked antibodies induced production of nascent neurons from endogenous and transplanted NSCs, which rebuilt the neuronal relay by forming connections with each other or host neurons to transmit electrophysiological signals and promote functional recovery. Thus, a scaffold-based strategy for rebuilding the neuronal differentiation microenvironment could be useful for SCI repair.",

        "abstract": "Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation is a promising or potential therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effects of injecting OECs directly into SCI site have been limited and unsatisfied due to the complexity of SCI. To improve the outcome, proper biomaterials are thought to be helpful since these materials would allow the cells to grow three-dimensionally and guide cell migration. In this paper, we have studied the behavior of OECs in two-dimensional (2-D) condition as well as on three-dimensional (3-D) collagen scaffolds by analyzing their phenotypes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, morphology, and gene activities of some neurotrophic factors and myelin proteins. OECs proliferation rate was increased on 3-D collagen scaffolds compared to the 2-D culture condition. OECs on 3-D collagen scaffolds also showed less apoptosis. In addition, OECs on 3-D collagen scaffolds maintained the original spindle-shape morphology and P75NTR gene activity. NGF, BDNF, and PLP were found to be upregulated in OECs cultured on 3-D collagen scaffolds by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach. The results suggested that 3-D collagen scaffolds provide suitable environments for the OECs to maintain their morphology as well as several important functional phenotypes and all these could be helpful for the effective treatment of SCI.",

Then it was entrapped with CNP prepared in our laboratory by the method of ionic cross linkage, and immunized Kunming mice were co-inoculated with paratyphoid vaccine. The peripheral blood was collected weekly from the tail vein of inoculated mice to detect the contents of IgG, IgA, IgM, and specific antibody against salmonella as well as the levels of interleukin-2 (IL2), IL-4, and IL-6 by SABC-ELISA assay. The numbers of leucocytes, monocytes, granuloytes, and lymphocytes were calculated separately using the routine method. The experimental mice were orally challenged with virulent salmonella 35 days after inoculation.This CpG ODN could remarkably provoke the proliferation of lymphocytes of pig in vitro in contrast with the control (P < 0.05). Compared with those of the control, immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgA, IgM, and specific antibodies to paratyphoid vaccine, increased significantly in sera from the CpG or CpG-CNP-vaccinated mice (P < 0.05). IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 increased remarkably in sera from immunized mice (P < 0.05). The leucocytes, monocytes, granuloytes, and lymphocytes of the mice immunized with CpG or CpG-CNP were also increased in number (P < 0.05). After the challenge, these immunity values were elevated in the mice vaccinated with CpG or CpG-CNP. The immunized mice all survived, while the control mice fell ill with evident lesions with diffuse hemorrhage in stomach, small intestine, and peritoneum.CpG ODN entrapped with CNP is a promising effective immunoadjuvant for vaccination, which promotes humoral and cellular immune responses, enhances immunity and resistance against salmonella by co-administration with paratyphoid vaccine.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To clarify whether Mycophenolic acid(MPA) or its metabolite AcMPAG can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, and to explore the effect of UGT2B7 SNP 211G>T on the pharmacokinetic of AcMPAG. METHODS: Twenty-four renal transplant patients were enrolled in this study. Pharmacokinetic study was performed on day 14 after transplantation and symptoms were recorded on the same day. Multiple blood samples were collected before dosing and 0.5,1,1.5,2,4,6,8,10 and 12 hours after morning dosing. Plasma concentrations of MPA, MPAG and AcMPAG were detected by HPLC. Genotype of UGT2B7 211G>T was determined using PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between patients with and without side effects for AUC(0-12) of MPA and MPAG. The values of AUC(0-12)/dose of MPA, MPAG and AcMPAG were (39.7±12.3), (1063.7±646.5) and (10.2±3.0) ng·h·mL-1·mg-1 in TT genotype group and (42.0±20.0),(1466.5±683.3) and (20.7±5.6) ng·h·mL-1·mg-1 in GG genotype group, respectively. The ratio of AUCAcMPAG(0-12)/AUCCMPA(0-12), which was used to describe the change of UGT2B7 enzyme activity, was 0.49±0.20,0.34±0.26 and 0.28±0.14 in recipients with 211GG, GT and TT genotype, respectively(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no significant differences in pharmacokinetics of MPA and its metabolites between side effect group and non-side effect group. It seems that the polymorphism 211G>T in the UGT2B7 gene results in the reduction of enzyme acitivity.",

Based on the radial basis function neural networks' online approximation capability, a novel adaptive neural controller is presented via backstepping technique. It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally, uniformly bounded in probability, and the tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood around the origin in the sense of mean quartic value. Simulation results further illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested control scheme. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Nanog is a transcription factor that plays key roles in the self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. Among Nanog's 11 pseudogenes, NANOGP8 theoretically could be a retrogene, but was considered unlikely as it has not been identified in any expressed sequence tags (ESTs). In this study, we found that NANOGP8 was expressed in several cancer cell lines and in all cancer tissues tested. The complete coding sequence was cloned and the sequence is highly homologous to that of Nanog. We were also able to detect its protein expression using anti-Nanog antibody in recombinant Escherichia coli and some cancer cell lines tested. In addition, expression of NANOGP8 in NIH3T3 cells can promote cell proliferation. The expression of NANOGP8 in cancer cell lines and cancer tissues suggests that NANOGP8 may play important roles in tumorigenesis. This work not only has potential significance in stem cell and cancer research, but it also raises the possibility that some of the human pseudogenes may have regulatory functions.",

        "abstract": "This note considers the problem of direct adaptive neural control for a class of nonlinear single-input/single-output (SISO) strict-feedback stochastic systems. The variable separation technique is introduced to decompose the coefficient functions of the diffusion term. Radical basis function (RBF) neural networks are used to approximate unknown and desired control signals, then a novel direct adaptive neural controller is constructed via backstepping. The proposed adaptive neural controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability. A main advantage of the proposed controller is that it contains only one adaptive parameter needed to be updated online. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

Mixed NiOx/NiOy films were prepared by two-step film deposition followed by furnace annealing. Mixed phases of Ni2O3 and NiO coexist across the mixed NiOx/NiOy films. Compared with a single-NiOy-film-based memory device, the mixed-NiOx/NiOy-film-based memory device shows improved unipolar resistive switching performances, including high ON/OFF ratio, sufficient operation voltage window, and good endurance characteristics. The improved memory performance could be attributed to the effect of oxygen-rich NiOx with more oxygen-rich Ni2O3, which can supply sufficient oxygen ions (O2−) for resistive switching in mixed-NiOx/NiOy-film-based resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive physical model on the resistive switching (RS) behaviors of bilayered TaO  x  -based RS access memory [resistive random access memory (RRAM)] is presented. In the model, the effects of the generation and recombination (G-R) of oxygen vacancies (   $V_{{rm{O}}}$   ), phase transition (P-T) between Ta 2 O 5  and TaO 2 , and the interaction (I-A) between Ta 2 O 5  and TaO  x   layers are involved to explain the RS behaviors based on  ab initio  calculations. An atomistic Monte Carlo simulation method based on the model is developed to investigate the dynamic physical processes and reproduce the experimental phenomena. The impacts of G-R and P-T as well as the I-A effects on the RS behaviors of a bilayered Ta 2 O 5 /TaO  x   structure and the device performances are identified. This paper indicates that the G-R effect dominates the RS behaviors, and self-compliance is due to the I-A effect. Based on the simulations, the optimization guidance of a bilayered TaO  x  -based RRAM is presented.",

        "abstract": "In the treatment of spinal cord injury, implantation of scaffolding biomaterials and the addition of neuroprotective factors will promote neural regeneration. It has been demonstrated in our previous work that linear ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) will bridge neural regeneration after the injury of spinal cord hemisection, and BDNF fused with a collagen binding domain (CBD-BDNF) can bind to collagen specifically to exert the neuroprotective effect. Besides neuroprotective factors, the lack of axon regeneration of the injured spinal cord has been attributed partially to regeneration inhibitors such as myelin associated proteins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation is downstream of the signaling pathways of these inhibitors. Here, the monoclonal antibody, 151IgG that inhibits signaling of EGFR was used to neutralize EGFR. 151IgG was cross-linked to LOCS and CBD-BDNF bound to LOCS to make a triple-functional biomaterial for neural regeneration (bridging, prompting growth and neutralizing growth inhibitors). This triple-functional device was tested in a 6 mm transected SCI model. Results showed that this collagen scaffold with the addition of 151IgG and CBD-BDNF provided effective bridging and stimulation effects for neural regeneration, recovery of electrical transmission of synapses and preventing the formation of glial scars in the extreme transected rat SCI model.",

        "abstract": "Early data taken during commissioning of the SDSS have resulted in the\ndiscovery of a very cool white dwarf. It appears to have stronger collision\ninduced absorption from molecular hydrogen than any other known white dwarf,\nsuggesting it has a cooler temperature than any other. While its distance is\npresently unknown, it has a surprisingly small proper motion, making it\nunlikely to be a halo star. An analysis of white dwarf cooling times suggests\nthat this object may be a low-mass star with a helium core. The SDSS imaging\nand spectroscopy also recovered LHS 3250, the coolest previously known white\ndwarf, indicating that the SDSS will be an effective tool for identifying these\nextreme objects.",

        "abstract": "L'ischémie cérébrale résultant de l'occlusion des quatre artères cervicales à destinée cérébrale est une pathologie rare. Le pontage entre l'aorte ascendante et une ou deux des artères carotides internes constitue une modalité thérapeutique. Cependant, le syndrome de reperfusion postopératoire reste une complication redoutable de ce type de procédure, potentiellement fatale. Le cas présenté ici est original. Une patiente présentait un infarctus cérébral massif hémisphérique gauche, des lésions des quatre artères cervicales, ainsi qu'un syndrome de vol sous-clavier bilatéral. Un pontage entre l'aorte ascendante et les deux artères axillaires permettait la restauration d'un flux vertébral, avec pour conséquence une amélioration clinique majeure. Au contraire des pontages entre l'aorte ascendante et le système carotidien qui augmentent directement la perfusion cérébrale, notre procédure permettait une amélioration du flux cérébral via les artères axillaires. C'est pourquoi, nous recommandons l'usage du pontage entre l'aorte ascendante et les deux artères axillaires chez les patients présentant une ischémie cérébrale consécutive à des lésions des quatre artères cervicales associées à un vol sous-clavier bilatéral inversant le flux des deux artères vertébrales.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To establish a population pharmacokinetics(PPK) model of vacomycin based on the therapeutic drug monitoring(TDM) data. The individualized pharmacokinetic parameters of vancomycin can be estimated through the model. Methods: The adult patients treated with vacomycin were recruited. Data of dosage regimen,plasma concentration,physiological and pathological condition were collected. The Nonlinear Mixed Effect Model(NONMEM) was used to establish the vancomycin PPK model. Results: Data of 169 patients from 9 departments including hematology and intensive care unit were collected,385 samples of vancomycin plasma concentrations including 39 peak and 346 trough concentrations were obtained. A twocompartment model was established based on the data from references and TDM data. The clearence(CL),volume distribuation of cetranl(V1) and peripheral compartment(V2),intercompartmental clearence(Q) of base model were estimated as 4.28 L·h-1,1.25 L,39.9 L and 9.78 L·h-1,respectively. The clearance of creatinine(CLcr) and body weight were found to have significant impact on CL and V2,respectively. According to the PPK model established,the AUC0-24 of 169 patients were(450.01±231.8) mg·L-1·h. Conclusion: The PPK model we established can be used to estimate the individualized vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters in Chinese adult patients.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an adaptive fuzzy output feedback control approach is investigated for a class of stochastic nonlinear strict-feedback systems without the requirement of states measurement. The stochastic nonlinear system addressed in this paper is assumed to possess unstructured uncertainties (unknown nonlinear functions) and, in the presence of unmodeled dynamics, dynamics disturbances. Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unstructured uncertainties, and a fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states. By combining the backstepping design technique with the stochastic small-gain approach, a new adaptive fuzzy output feedback control approach is developed. It is proved that the proposed control approach can guarantee that the closed-loop system is input-state-practically stability (ISpS) in probability, and the observer errors and the output of the system converge to a small neighborhood of the origin by appropriate choice of the design parameters. Simulation results are included to indicate that the proposed adaptive fuzzy control approach has a satisfactory control performance. In addition, the simulation comparisons with the previous methods show that the proposed adaptive fuzzy control approach has robustness to the dynamical uncertainties.",

        "abstract": "People recently realized that it is important for artificial vascular biodegradable graft to bionically mimic the functions of the native vessel. In order to overcome the high risk of thrombosis and keep the patency in the clinical small-diameter vascular graft (SDVG) transplantation, a double-layer bionic scaffold, which can offer anticoagulation and mechanical strength simultaneously, was designed and fabricated via electrospinning technique.Heparin-conjugated polycaprolactone (hPCL) and polyurethane (PU)-collagen type I composite was used as the inner and outer layers, respectively. The porosity and the burst pressure of SDVG were evaluated. Its biocompatibility was demonstrated by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol)-2,5-diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test in vitro and subcutaneous implants in vivo respectively. The grafts of diameter 2.5 mm and length 4.0 cm were implanted to replace the femoral artery in Beagle dog model. Then, angiography was performed in the Beagle dogs to investigate the patency and aneurysm of grafts at 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-transplantation. After angiography, the patent grafts were explanted for histological analysis.The double-layer bionic SDVG meet the clinical mechanical demand. Its good biocompatibility was proven by cytotoxicity experiment (the cell's relative growth rates (RGR) of PU-collagen outer layer were 102.8%, 109.2% and 103.5%, while the RGR of hPCL inner layer were 99.0%, 100.0% and 98.0%, on days 1, 3, and 5, respectively) and the subdermal implants experiment in the Beagle dog. Arteriography showed that all the implanted SDVGs were patent without any aneurismal dilatation or obvious anastomotic stenosis at the 2nd, 4th, and 8th week after the operation, except one SDVG that failed at the 2nd week. Histological analysis and SEM showed that the inner layer was covered by new endothelial-like cells.The double-layer bionic SDVG is a promising candidate as a replacement of native small-diameter vascular graft.",

Human OCT4 can generate two isoforms by alternative splicing, termed OCT4A and OCT4B. OCT4A confers the stemness properties of ES cells, whereas the function of OCT4B is unknown. We present here the diverse protein products and a novel function of OCT4 gene. A single OCT4B mRNA can encode three isoforms by alternative translation initiation at AUG and CUG start codons, respectively. A putative internal ribosome entry site (IRES) has been identified in OCT4B mRNA accounting for the translation mechanism. The OCT4B-190 is upregulated under stress conditions and it may protect cell against apoptosis under stress. This work evokes the significance to distinguish the biological function of the protein products of OCT4. The OCT4 gene, by the regulation of alternative splicing and alternative translation initiation, may carry out more crucial roles in many biological events.",

A delay-range-dependent sufficient condition is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which guarantees the existence of a linear filter. The proposed filter ensures that the filtering error system is stochastically asymptotically stable and that its L 2–L ∞ performance satisfies a prescribed level. The corresponding filter design is cast into a convex optimization problem which can be efficiently handled by using standard numerical algorithms. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage have recently been recognized as contributing to the efficacy of most bactericidal antibiotics, irrespective of their primary macromolecular targets. Inhibitors of targets involved in both combating oxidative stress as well as being required for in vivo survival may exhibit powerful synergistic action. This study demonstrates that the de novo arginine biosynthetic pathway in  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  ( Mtb ) is up-regulated in the early response to the oxidative stress-elevating agent isoniazid or vitamin C. Arginine deprivation rapidly sterilizes the  Mtb  de novo arginine biosynthesis pathway mutants Δ argB  and Δ argF  without the emergence of suppressor mutants in vitro as well as in vivo. Transcriptomic and flow cytometry studies of arginine-deprived  Mtb  have indicated accumulation of ROS and extensive DNA damage. Metabolomics studies following arginine deprivation have revealed that these cells experienced depletion of antioxidant thiols and accumulation of the upstream metabolite substrate of ArgB or ArgF enzymes. Δ argB  and Δ argF  were unable to scavenge host arginine and were quickly cleared from both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. In summary, our investigation revealed in vivo essentiality of the de novo arginine biosynthesis pathway for  Mtb  and a promising drug target space for combating tuberculosis.",

After labeled with a red fluorescent dye PKH26-GL, the cells were seeded onto the luminal surface of decellularized porcine scaffolds with single, rotative method for 4 h. Following static culture for 24 - 72 h, the hybrids were implanted to replace autologous canine inferior vena cava about 4 cm long. Meantime one femoral artery-venous shunt about 1 cm long was performed. The non-seeded decellularized scaffolds (n = 4) were performed the same as control. Angiography was performed and the hybrids were explanted for morphology and labeled cells' immuno-fluorescence examinations at postoperative 10 d, 4 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively.The patent number of experiment (control) group were 7/7 (2/4), 6/6 (2/2) and 4/4 (1/2) at postoperative 10 d, 4 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. At 12 weeks, tightly confluence endothelial cells which covered the whole inner luminal surface of the explants were detected by immunohistochemistry of factor VIII and scanning electron microscopy, while fibrin-based pseudo-intima was detected on the inner luminal surface of matrix in the solo patent dog from the control group. Meanwhile, fibroblasts and alpha-actin positive cells in the matrices were found by transmission electron microscopy and alpha-actin immunohistochemistry. PKH26-GL labeled EPCs sustained on the luminal surface at a rather proportion accompanied by newly formed endothelial cells. However, the explants in both groups showed partial stenosis.Such constructed tissue engineered venous graft based on canine autologous bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells and porcine decellularized aortic matrices is promising and deserve to further improvement and testing.",

There is lack of effective treatments due to the limitation of native materials available and complexity of the function and internal environment of uterus. In the present study, a collagen targeting basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) delivery system was constructed by a collagen membrane loaded with bFGF fused a collagen-binding domain (CBD) to the N-terminal which limits the diffusion of bFGF from collagen. We tested the bFGF delivery system in rats under the severe uterine damage model (partial rat uterine horn excision/reconstruction), and found this delivery system improved regeneration abilities of uterine endometrium and muscular cells, improved vascularization, as well as better pregnancy outcomes in rats. Therefore, this targeting delivery system may be an effective strategy for uterine tissue regeneration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The treatment of portal hypertension caused by an occlusive lesion in the retrohepatic inferior vena cava and terminal portal venules is complicated because both portal and system venous flow are compromised.A 47-year-old woman presented with this issue, and we reasoned that the only way to achieve successful management was to create a meso-cavo-jugular shunt. This patient was referred to us after undergoing a splenectomy for hypersplenism, which made her ascites intractable. She had a retrohepatic vena caval stenosis and noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the inferior vena cava stenosis failed. She underwent substernal placement of a 14-mm ringed GoreTex graft (WL Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) with end-to-side connections to the superior mesenteric vein, internal jugular vein, and vena cava.Her ascites resolved, and at follow-up 8 years later her graft was patent.The meso-cavo-jugular shunt can simultaneously decompress both portal and systemic venous systems and is worth considering in the rare circumstance of suprahepatic vena caval obstruction coupled with occlusion of the portal venules.",

The aim of the present work was to develop a direct chemical approach to immobilize the platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) on DBM with cross-linking reagents. The amount of PDGF-BB covalently immobilized on DBM was significantly increased. The increased proliferation of fibroblasts demonstrated that the biological activity of PDGF-BB was not significantly reduced by cross-linking. Compared with control groups, there was a statistically significant increase in blood vessel density in the PDGF-C-DBM group after having been subcutaneously implanted into the dorsal side of the rats. The surface bioactivity of scaffolds on stimulation cell and new blood vessel invasion was improved. Therefore, the direct chemical cross-linking approach could be used to retain growth factors on collagen scaffolds effectively to develop functional biomaterials.",

Inhibitors of targets involved in both combating oxidative stress as well as being required for in vivo survival may exhibit powerful synergistic action. This study demonstrates that the de novo arginine biosynthetic pathway in  () is up-regulated in the early response to the oxidative stress-elevating agent isoniazid or vitamin C. Arginine deprivation rapidly sterilizes the  de novo arginine biosynthesis pathway mutants Δ and Δ without the emergence of suppressor mutants in vitro as well as in vivo. Transcriptomic and flow cytometry studies of arginine-deprived  have indicated accumulation of ROS and extensive DNA damage. Metabolomics studies following arginine deprivation have revealed that these cells experienced depletion of antioxidant thiols and accumulation of the upstream metabolite substrate of ArgB or ArgF enzymes. Δ and Δ were unable to scavenge host arginine and were quickly cleared from both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. In summary, our investigation revealed in vivo essentiality of the de novo arginine biosynthesis pathway for  and a promising drug target space for combating tuberculosis.",

Its fiber is similar to the collagenous fiber of bone. To explore if BC could be utilized as a localized delivery system to increase the local concentration of cytokines for tissue engineering, we prepared the BC scaffold from Acetobacter xylinum X-2 (A. xylinum X-2) and investigated the osteogenic potential of the BC scaffold coated with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). The data showed that BC had a good biocompatibility and induced differentiation of mouse fibroblast-like C2C12 cells into osteoblasts in the presence of BMP-2 in vitro, as demonstrated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assays. Within a certain range (0 ∼ 3 μg/scaffold), the osteogenic activity of induced osteoblasts was positively correlated to the concentrations of BMP-2. In in vivo subcutaneous implantation studies, BC scaffolds carrying BMP-2 showed more bone formation and higher calcium concentration than the BC scaffolds alone at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. The ALP activity assay and the measurement of calcium concentration of BC scaffolds also showed that more new bone was developed in the BC scaffolds carrying BMP-2 than in the BC scaffolds alone. Our studies suggest that BC is a good localized delivery system for BMPs and would be a potential candidate in bone tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) serves an important role in promoting angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. However, the lack of an effective delivery system that can target this growth factor to the injured site reduces its therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, in the current study, collagen‑binding VEGF was constructed by fusing a collagen‑binding domain (CBD) to the N‑terminal of native VEGF. The CBD‑VEGF can specifically bind to collagen which is the major component of the extracellular matrix in fibrotic liver. The anti‑fibrotic effects of this novel material were investigated by the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)‑induced liver fibrotic mouse model. Mice were injected with CCl4 intraperitoneally to induce liver fibrosis. CBD‑VEGF was injected directly into the liver tissue of mice. The liver tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for general observation or with Masson's trichrome staining for detection of collagen deposition. The hepatic stellate cell activation, blood vessel formation and hepatocyte proliferation were measured by immunohistochemical staining for α‑smooth muscle actin, CD31 and Ki67 in the liver tissue. The fluorescent TUNEL assay was performed to evaluate the hepatocyte apoptosis. The present study identified that the CBD‑VEGF injection could significantly promote vascularization of the liver tissue of fibrotic mice and attenuate liver fibrosis. Furthermore, hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic stellate cell activation were attenuated by CBD‑VEGF treatment. CBD‑VEGF treatment could additionally promote hepatocyte regeneration in the liver tissue of fibrotic mice. Thus, it was suggested that CBD‑VEGF may be used as a novel therapeutic intervention for liver fibrosis.",

Methods: The clinical data of 64 patients with arteriosclerotic subclavian steal syndrome undergoing axillo-axillary prosthetic bypass grafting over the past 7 years were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The success rate for bypass surgery was 100%,and no perioperative death occurred in the entire group.Five patients developed wound hematoma,8 patients had symptoms of nerve injury,and no case of wound or graft infection was noted after surgery.Among the 55 patients followed up,the symptoms in 49 cases were improved,and vertebral blood flow improvement was seen in 94.87%(37/39) of the patients with stage IV retrograde vertebral flow and in 62.50%(5/8) of the patients with stage III retrograde vertebral flow,but no improvement was found in the two patients with stage II retrograde vertebral flow.No symptomatic improvement was observed after surgery in two patients,and 4 patients developed dizziness or limb numbness again during 3 to 25 months following surgery,and 5 of these 6 cases had improvement of vertebral blood flow.After surgery,the mean pressure gradient between upper limbs reverted to 10.22 mmHg,prosthetic thrombosis occurred in 4 cases and new cerebral infarction developed in 4 cases. Conclusion: Axillo-axillary crossover bypass grafting is a safe and effective procedure for patients with subclavian steal.This procedure can effectively improve blood flow in the vertebral artery,but the vertebral flow improvement is not always associated with symptomatic improvement.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, fast trap behaviors in Ge pMOSFETs with Al 2 O 3 /GeO  x  /Ge gate-stack are evaluated and quantitatively characterized using a novel sub-1-ns ultrafast measurement (UFM) system. By changing the operation temperature and the rising time of the applied gate voltage (   ${V}_{text {g}}$   ), it is found that the fast trap filling process could be observed within the first 10 ns after the gate voltage was applied, and the process would be more clearly characterized at a raised operation temperature. In addition, the trap density distribution and the time constant of the fast traps inside the valence band edge are experimentally extracted based on the UFMs. It is found that the trap densities inside the valence band edge are within the range of 10 13  to 10 14  cm   $^{-2}cdot text {eV}^{-1}$   , which are consistent with the reported values from the Hall measurements. It is experimentally confirmed that the time constants of the fast traps in Ge pMOSFETs with Al 2 O 3 /GeO  x  /Ge gate-stack are about 10 ns, and deeper energy level corresponds to smaller time constant.",

The method of first derivative spectrum was used to estimate accurately the disease of cotton single leaves infected by compared with the reflectance spectrum of different single leaves infected by verticillium wilt. 【Result】 The results indicated that spectrum characteristics of cotton leaf infected by verticillium wilt had better regularity with the increase of SL in different periods and varieties. Spectrum reflectance increased significantly in visible light region (400-700 nm) and near-infrared region (700-1 300 nm) with the increase of the SL, and especially significant in visible light regions (525-680 nm). When SL attained b2 (25%), cotton leaf infected by verticillium wilt could be used as a threshold and diagnose index in early period. There were evident different characteristics of first derivative spectra in these diseased leaves, it changed significantly in red edge ranges (680-780 nm) in different SL, red edge of first derivative spectrum swing decreased, and red edge position equal moved to the blue. The results indicated that 434-724 nm and 909-1 600 nm should be selected out as sensitive bands region to SLof single leaf. Some inversion models for estimating cotton leaf SL of verticillium wilt all reached the best significant level. 【Conclusion】The results suggested that different spectrum characteristics of cotton leaf infected by verticillium wilt were marked. The model in which the first derivative spectra at 723 nm could invert accurately the cotton leaf SL, and it may be used to forecast the position of cotton leaf infected by verticillium wilt quantitatively.",

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 45 kidney cancer patients with bone metastases who were treated in our hospital between Jan 1997 and Jan 2007. Multiple prognostic factors were analyzed such as age, gender, tumor size, resection of primary lesions, radiation of primary lesions, number of bone lesions, serum alkahne phosphatase (ALP) level, parenchyma metastases, lymph node metastases, and normal organ metastases. Survival time was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed using log-rank method and multivariate analysis was conducted using COX regression model. Results: The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 54.0%, 26.0% and 17.3% respectively for kidney cancer patients with bone metastasis and the median survival time was (14.0±1.8) months. Univariate analysis showed that there was significant difference in the survival rate between serum ALP level ≤ 150 u/L and > 150 u/L group (P = 0. 001). Other parameters had no prognostic value. COX multivariate analysis showed that serum ALP levels at the time of bone metastasis, normal organ or lymph node metastases were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: The kidney cancer patients with bone metastases has poor prognosis. The serum ALP level, normal organ metastases or lymph node metastases were independent prognostic factors. These prognostic factors will help to determine the appropriate plan and dose of fractionated radiotherapy.",

The survivors complicated with associated serious injuries are even rare and definitive treatment is required. A 37-year-old male patient had both aortic blunt injury and coronary artery injury after a frontal car collision. After failed coronary artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and deteriorated aortic lesion, the ruptured aorta was subsequently successfully treated by us with a self-made individualized endograft. The endograft was well in position and the patient functioned well in 11-year followup. With the development of endograft and technique, the endovascular treatment may be an option for patients with complicated aortic blunt injury. Yet careful patient selection and the long-term followup are essential.",

Simple modeling of the X-ray spectra,\nand consideration of the details of the X-ray and optical lightcurves\ncorroborate the polar nature of these three systems and provide further\ninsights into their accretion characteristics. During the XMM-Newton\nobservation of SDSS J072910.68+365838.3, X-rays are undetected apart from a\nprobable flare event, during which we find both the typical hard X-ray\nbremsstrahlung component and a very strong line O VII (E=0.57 keV), but no\nevidence of a soft blackbody contribution. In SDSS J075240.45+362823.2 we\nidentify an X-ray eclipse at the beginning of the observation, roughly in phase\nwith the primary minimum of the optical broad band curve. The X-ray spectra\nrequire the presence of both hard and soft X-ray components, with their\nluminosity ratio consistent with that found in other recent XMM-Newton results\non polars. Lastly, SDSS J170053.30+400357.6 appears optically as a very typical\npolar, however its large amplitude optical modulation is 180 degrees out of\nphase with the variation in our short X-ray lightcurve.",

The aim of the present study was to combine a collagen-binding domain (CBD) with native EGF (NAT-EGF) to form a fusion protein, aiming at that it could bind to collagen scaffolds specifically. This approach could restrict the diffusion of EGF despite of extracellular fluids and limit the release of EGF to surrounding tissues. Thus, the retained CBD-EGF would render a continual function during the tissue regeneration. In our study, in vitro bioactivity assay showed that there was no significant difference between CBD-EGF and NAT-EGF to stimulate human fibroblasts to proliferate. In the collagen-binding assay, CBD-EGF exhibited a specific binding ability to collagen compared to NAT-EGF. Finally, in vivo experiment demonstrated that CBD-EGF-loaded collagen membranes uniformly possess a high capability to promote cellularization of scaffolds as compared with that of NAT-EGF. All results aforementioned suggested that collagen loaded with CBD-EGF is a functional biomaterial with potential clinical applications.",

An IgG3 mAb (9d8) specific for arabinomannan and reactive with purified antigen from a clinical isolate of M. tuberculosis conferred partial protection on mice after respiratory challenge (30-60% survival >75 days; P </= 0.05). Control mice pretreated with an irrelevant mAb of the same isotype succumbed to tuberculosis within 30 days. Mice with gene disruptions in interferon gamma and major histocompatibility complex Class II also were partially protected from challenge. The protective mAb was neither bactericidal nor inhibitory of infection or bacterial replication. Nevertheless, it profoundly altered the nature of the granulomas in the infected lungs. Mice treated with mAb 9d8 and challenged with M. tuberculosis localized the pathogen within granuloma centers, suggesting that the mAb conferred protection by enhancing a cellular immune response.",

Via-points are assigned at different postures, and angles of each via-point are solved analytically. Then these angles are interpolated by a third order spline for generating joint trajectories, and they can be adjusted by given step length and foot clearance. Exoskeletons for paraplegics usually have passive ankle to reduce system weight, but passive ankle drops down the foot in swing phase, thus hip and knee joints need larger flexion to lift the swing toe compared with healthy individuals. This work proposes a design that drives the ankle joint with a cable for dorsiflexion in swing phase. Simulation results show that the swing toe can be lifted higher with this design, and it is promising that the maximum hip and knee flexion can be reduced so as to achieve better energy efficiency.",

BCG has limitations as a TB vaccine so we have focused on live attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants as vaccine candidates. Prior to human studies, however, it is necessary to demonstrate safety in non-human primates (NHP). In this study, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of two live attenuated M. tuberculosis double deletion vaccine strains mc(2)6020 (DeltalysA DeltapanCD) and mc(2)6030 (DeltaRD1 DeltapanCD) in cynomolgus macaques. In murine models, mc(2)6020 is rapidly cleared while mc(2)6030 persists. Both mc(2)6020 and mc(2)6030 were safe and well tolerated in cynomolgus macaques. Following a high-dose intrabronchial challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis, mc(2)6020-vaccinates were afforded a level of protection intermediate between that elicited by BCG vaccination and no vaccination. BCG vaccinates had reduced tuberculosis-associated pathology and improved clinical scores as compared to saline and mc(2)6030 vaccinates, but survival did not differ among the groups.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the feasibility of preparing the porous extracellular matrix (ECM) by use of some chemicals and enzymes to decellularize the porcine carotid artery.The porcine carotid artery was procured, and warm ischemia time was less than 30 minutes. The porcine carotid artery was decellularized with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 60 hours to prepare common ECM; then common ECM was treated with 0.25% trypsin (for 6 hours) and 0.3 U/mL collagenase (for 24 hours) to prepare porous ECM. The common ECM and porous ECM were stained with HE, Masson's trichrome, and Orcein to evaluate the histological features. Then the mechanical property, cytotoxicity, and pore size of ECMs were determined. After 4 weeks of subcutaneous implantation in dogs, the histological examination was used for the study.Histological observation confirmed that 2 kinds of ECMs were decellularized completely and more porous structure was observed in porous ECM. Scanning electron microscope showed the pores in porous ECM were greater and the length of shorter axis in porous ECM ranged from 5 to 30 microm, the length of longer axis from 40 to 100 microm. The porosity of porous ECM (99.25%) was greater than that of common ECM (91.50%). The burst pressure of porous ECM decreased when compared with common ECM, showing significant difference [(0.154 3 +/- 0.0127) MPa vs. [0.305 2 +/- 0.015 7) MPa, P < 0.05]. There was no significant difference in suture retention strength between 2 kinds of ECMs (P > 0.05). The cytotoxicity test showed no obvious cytotoxicity in 2 kinds of ECMs. In vivo implantation test showed that the deeper host cells infiltration and more neo-microvessels in porous ECM were observed than in common ECM.SDS and some enzymes can be used to prepare porous ECM as the scaffold for tissue engineered blood vessels.",

In previous studies, we fabricated a fusion protein CBD-bFGF that specifically binds to and releases from collagen biomaterials. We demonstrated that CBD-bFGF could promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration in vivo. In this study, we established a beagle model with extensive urethral defects, and reconstructed the defects with collagen biomaterials that were unmodified or modified with CBD-bFGF. The results demonstrate that CBD-bFGF promotes corpus spongiosum regeneration resulting in improved outcomes following urethral reconstruction. Modifying collagen biomaterials with CBD-bFGF may represent an effective strategy for urethral substitution in urethral reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Podocyte has inflammatory role in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an anti-inflammatory agent, can suppress macrophage infiltration and reduce renal injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), another renal protecting agent, can decrease podocyte loss in DN. In this study, we detected the expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and nephrin to evaluate podocyte's role in inflammatory reaction in DN, observe and compare the effect of MMF alone and in combination with valsartan, on preventing podocyte loss in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats.Diabetic model was constructed in uninephrectomized male Wistar rats by single peritoneal injection of STZ (65 mg/kg). The successfully induced diabetic rats were randomly divided into four groups: diabetes without treatment group (DM), valsartan treated group (DMV), MMF treated group (DMM), and combined therapy group (DMVM). Normal rats of the same sibling were chosen as control (NC). At the end of the 8th week, serum biochemistry, 24-hour urinary protein (UP) and the ratio of kidney weight/body weight (RWK/B) were measured. The rats were sacrificed for the observation of renal histomorphology through light and electron microscope. Nephrin, desmin and MCP-1 levels were detected by semi-quantitative immunohistochemical assays. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of nephrin and MCP-1.Compared with group NC, serum glucose level, 24-hour UP and RWK/B in group DM were significantly higher (P < 0.01), and the nephrin mRNA level in DM group was significantly lower (P < 0.05). The nephrin mRNA expression levels in group DMV, DMM and DMVM were all higher than that of DM group (P < 0.05) and no significant differences were found among the three treatment groups (P > 0.05). Treatment with MMF, valsartan or their combination could significantly decrease the 24-hour UP and RWK/B, and suppress glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrotic lesions in diabetic rats. In diabetic rats, the high expressions of desmin and MCP-1 in kidney were suppressed by valsartan, MMF or their combination.Podocytes are involved in the inflammatory reaction of diabetic rats. MMF could suppress MCP-1 and desmin expression, enhance nephrin expression, and attenuate proteinuria in diabetic rats. The combined therapy of valsartan and MMF did not show any superiority over monotherapies on renal protection. MMF may have renoprotective effect in early stages of diabetic nephropathy through preventing podocytes loss and anti-inflammatory activity.",

The diodes are with simple HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 /GeO x /Ge-sub structure and could be fabricated by fully CMOS compatible process. Owing to the adoption of a very thin GeO x  interfacial layer, the diodes show both excellent resistive switching and rectifying characteristics. Furthermore, TCAM cell and array are built with two diodes connected back-to-back. Finally, a well-functioning 8×16 HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 /GeO x /Ge-sub TCAM array for parallel multi-data search is demonstrated. This novel diode-based cell structure is very promising for future energy and area efficient TCAM applications.",

Issues need to be concerned in the stability analysis of electrolytic manganese residue storage with seepage-proofing membrane were discussed in terms of material properties. It was found from those tests that the consolidation properties of deposited electrolytic manganese residue are quite different from majority of tailings,with the minor consolidation settlement larger than the major consolidation settlement. The shear strength of electrolytic manganese reside is lower under unconsolidated-undrained conditions,however,it is increased after being consolidated drained,much higher than those of tailings powder and tailings clay.",

Based on the structural characteristic and the monotonously increasing property of the system bounding functions, a variable separation method is first developed. By this method, an approximation-based adaptive backstepping approach is proposed for a class of nonlinear non-strict-feedback systems. It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees semi-global boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop systems.

In this work, we explain the $Sigma_b(6097)$ to be a $1P$ state with $J^P=5/2^-$ or $3/2^-$ by giving the mass spectrum analysis and the strong decay calculation, and predict the existence of $1P$ and $2S$ partners of the $Sigma_b(6097)$, where their masses and the corresponding decay behaviors are presented. Because of the success of describing the $Sigma_b(6097)$ and the former observed $Xi_b(6227)$ under the quasi-two-body treatment to the bottom baryons, we continue to predict the $Omega_b$ partners of $Sigma_b(6097)$ by the same method, which are the $1P$ and $2S$ states of the $bss$ baryon system. Identifying these predicted bottom baryons will be a research topic full of challenge and opportunity for future experiments especially the LHCb.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the expression of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in the kidney tissues of diabetic rats and the effects of valsartan, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and their combined application on the renal TRAIL and NF-kappaB expression.Eighty uninephrectomized male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: normal control (NC) group (n = 28), undergoing intraperitoneal injection of citric acid buffer, and diabetes mellitus (DM) group, undergoing intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to establish DM models. The 52 DM rats were randomly divided into 7 equal subgroups: DM without treatment for 4 weeks (DM4), DM without treatment for 8 weeks (DM8) DM without treatment for 12 weeks (DM12) , and DM without treatment for 16 weeks (DM16), valsartan treatment (DM + V), MMF treatment (DM + M), and combined treatment (DM + V + M). The treatment subgroups were treated for 8 weeks immediately after the diabetic models ere established. Twenty-four hour urine was collected to measure the amount of protein 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after the induction of DM respectively. The rats were sacrificed. Blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta to detect the blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (sCr), albumin, and glucose. The kidneys were taken out. Hypertrophy index (left kidney weight/body weight) was determined. Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of TRAIL and NF-kappaB mRNA. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the protein expression of TRAIL and NF-kappaB.1) The 24 h urine protein levels and hypertrophy indexes of all DM subgroups were significantly higher than those of the NC groups (all P <0.05). 24 h urine protein and hypertrophy index increased gradually and peaked in the l2th week; blood albumin gradually decreased since the 8th week(P <0.01), and BUN and sCr began to decrease only since the 16th week (both P <0.01). Compared with the DM 8 subgroup, the hypertrophy index and 24 h urine protein of the different treatment subgroups, especially the DM + V + M subgroup, were significantly lower (all P <0.05). 2) Quantitative real time RT-PCR showed that compared with the NC group, the TRAIL expression levels of the DM subgroups were significantly lower before the 12th week after induction of DM model (all P < 0.01), and then significantly higher in the 16th week (all P < 0.01). The TRAIL expression of the treatment groups, especially that of the DM + M subgroup, were significantly higher than that of the DM8 group (all P <0.05). Compared with the NC group, the NF-kappaB expression levels of the DM subgroups were significantly higher time-dependently (all P <0.01). Compared with the DM8 group, the NF-kappaB expression levels of the treatment subgroups, especially that of the DM + V + M subgroup were significantly lower (all P <0.05). 3) The expression of TRAIL was mainly located in the convoluted tubule of kidney, and no TRAIL protein expression was detected in the glomeruli or renal vasculature. The levels of NF-kappaB protein expression, shown in glomeruli and convoluted tubules, of all DM subgroups were all higher than that of the NC group. The NF-kappaB protein expression level of the DM + V + M subgroup was significantly lower. The number of NF-kappaB positive cells was significantly related to the mononuclear macrophage infiltration , kidney function, and structural lesion.An important monitoring factor in the autoimmune system, TRAIL closely participates in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, possibly controlled by NF-kappaB. In the early stage combination of valsartan and MMF may upregulate the expression of TRAIL, thus protecting the kidney function.",

        "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly heterogeneous and has a poor prognosis. It is therefore important to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Although emerging research has revealed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as vital to carcinogenesis and cancer progression, their functional involvement in TNBC has not been well defined. In this study, we utilized the TCGA database and analysed clinical samples to show that the long non-coding antisense transcript of NAMPT, NAMPT-AS, is upregulated in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis, lymph node involvement, metastasis, and advanced stage. NAMPT-AS was co-transcribed with NAMPT from a bidirectional promoter, where the distributions of H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac chromatin modifications were enriched based on ENCODE and FANTOM5, suggesting the potential enhancer-RNA characteristics of NAMPT-AS. NAMPT-AS epigenetically regulated the expression of NAMPT in two divergent ways: NAMPT-AS recruited POU2F2 to activate the transcription of NAMPT, and NAMPT-AS acted as a competing endogenous RNA to rescue NAMPT degradation from miR-548b-3p. NAMPT-AS/NAMPT promoted tumor progression and regulated autophagy through the mTOR pathway in vitro and in vivo. In a cohort of 480 breast cancer patients, NAMPT was associated with breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival. These results demonstrate that NAMPT-AS is an oncogenic lncRNA in TNBC that epigenetically activates NAMPT to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Furthermore, these data identify NAMPT-AS/NAMPT as promising therapeutic targets in TNBC patients.",

The Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey's 0.5m photometric telescope (PT) and 2.5m survey telescope\nwere used to observe the afterglow of GRB010222 starting 4.8 hours after the\nGRB. The 0.5m PT observed the afterglow in five, 300 sec g' band exposures over\nthe course of half an hour, measuring a temporal decay rate in this short\nperiod of F_nu \\propto t^{-1.0+/-0.5}. The 2.5m camera imaged the counterpart\nnearly simultaneously in five filters (u' g' r' i' z'), with r' = 18.74+/-0.02\nat 12:10 UT. These multicolor observations, corrected for reddening and the\nafterglow's temporal decay, are well fit by the power-law F_nu \\propto\nnu^{-0.90+/-0.03} with the exception of the u' band UV flux which is 20% below\nthis slope. We examine possible interpretations of this spectral shape,\nincluding source extinction in a star forming region.",

        "abstract": "The ability to sense external force is an important technique for force feedback, haptics and safe interaction control in minimally-invasive surgical robots (MISRs). Moreover, this ability plays a significant role in the restricting refined surgical operations. The wrist joints of surgical robot end-effectors are usually actuated by several long-distance wire cables. Its two forceps are each actuated by two cables. The scope of force sensing includes multidimensional external force and one-dimensional clamping force. This paper focuses on one-dimensional clamping force sensing method that do not require any internal force sensor integrated in the end-effector's forceps. A new clamping force estimation method is proposed based on a joint torque disturbance observer (JTDO) for a cable-driven surgical robot end-effector. The JTDO essentially considers the variations in cable tension between the actual cable tension and the estimated cable tension using a Particle Swarm Optimization Back Propagation Neural Network (PSO-BPNN) under free motion. Furthermore, a clamping force estimator is proposed based on the forceps' JTDO and their mechanical relations. According to comparative analyses in experimental studies, the detection resolutions of collision force and clamping force were 0.11 N. The experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed clamping force sensing method.",

        "abstract": "Traditional views consider scar tissue formed in the lesion epicenter after severe spinal cord injury (SCI) as both a physical barrier and chemical impediment for axonal regeneration. Recently, a controversial opinion suggested that astrocyte scar formation aids rather than prevents axonal regeneration in the CNS. Here, following complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord (T8) in rats, we found that scar tissue showed greater growth factor expression at 2 weeks than 8 weeks post-SCI. Further, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that the components of scar tissue formed in the subacute phase are quite different from that formed in the chronic phase. We also found significantly increased axonal regrowth of sensory axons into the lesion center after chronically formed scar tissue was removed. This indicates that scar tissue formed at the chronic phase actually inhibits axonal regeneration, and that chronic removal of scar tissue may have clinical significance and benefit for SCI repair. Taken together, our study suggests that the features and roles of subacute and chronic scar tissues formed post-SCI is different and scar tissue-targeted strategies for spinal cord regeneration cannot be generalized.",

        "abstract": "Growth factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are widely used in the recovery of spinal cord injury (SCI) for promoting axonal regeneration or improving neuron survival. However, the lack of efficient delivery approaches limits their clinical applications. In this study, we constructed an efficient delivery system including collagen-binding BDNF and linear ordered collagen scaffolds (LOCS). A collagen-binding domain (CBD) was utilized to construct collagen-targeting BDNF (CBD-BDNF) to allow its specific binding to the collagen. In vitro activity assay showed that CBD-BDNF had similar bioactivity in neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglia and the survival of PC12 cells. CBD-BDNF was shown to have specific binding activity to collagen. Using the rat hemisection SCI model, we found that LOCS loaded with CBD-BDNF significantly improved the SCI recovery evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale and immunohistochemical staining with anti-neurofilament antibody. Thus, this targeting drug delivery system consisting of CBD-BDNF and LOCS could be an effective strategy for the repair of SCI.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell based therapy is coming of age. Besides stem cell transplantation, it has been a goal to use native autologous stem cells for tissue regeneration. However, the recruitment of native autologous stem cells at the targeting site has not been sufficient which limits the clinical application of autologous stem cells. Biomaterials have been increasingly used in tissue repair. They not only serve as scaffolds for cell proliferation, differentiation, and also provide guidance for 3-D reestablishment. In this study, we have attempted to enrich autologous stem cells at the wound site through a stem-cell-capturing collagen scaffold by conjugating with a stem cell specific antibody. Sca-1 is a common surface marker of hematopoietic, cardiac and skeletal muscle stem cells. Due to the interaction of antibody and antigen, Sca-1 positive cells could be enriched to the functional collagen scaffold both in vitro and in vivo. When the functional collagen scaffold is transplanted into C57/BL6 mouse as a patch to repair a surgical heart defect, the regeneration of cardiomyocytes has been observed. Thus, the collagen scaffolds covalently conjugated with stem cell specific antibody could be an effective approach to promote tissue regeneration.",

De février 2002 à juillet 2008, 31 malades nous ont été confiés. Dix-huit malades avaient un échec thérapeutique, 4 avaient été opérés, et 10 avaient eu un traitement conservateur. Tous avaient une l’ascite réfractaire ou/et des hématémèses. Les procédures utilisées dans cette série ont inclus un shunt mésentérico-cavo-atrial chez 10 malades, un traitement radical chez 9 malades, un shunt mésentérico-cavo-jugulaire chez 7 (y compris 2 shunts mésentérico-jugulaires), un shunt mésentérico-cave chez 2 malades, un shunt cavo-atrial chez 2 malades (y compris la révision d’un shunt cavo-atrial), et un shunt cavo-jugulaire. La mortalité chirurgicale et les complications postopératoires étaient de 3,2%. Vingt-huit malades ont eu un suivi moyen de 40 mois. Les résultats du suivi étaient mesurés comme excellents, bons, moyens, mauvais, et le décès (respectivement 28,6%, 53,6%, 10,7%, 3,6%, et 3,6%). La mortalité totale du groupe est de 6,5%.

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the nonlinearities of the discrete-time IPMSM drive system which is derived by direct discretization using Euler method, and a discrete-time fuzzy position tracking controller is designed via backstepping approach. In contrast to existing results, the advantage of the scheme is that the number of the adjustable parameters is reduced to two only and the problem of coupling nonlinearity can be overcome. It is shown that the proposed discrete-time fuzzy controller can guarantee the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin and all the signals are bounded. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and the potentials of the theoretic results obtained.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the significant of nitric oxide (NO) in immunoreaction in two different kinds of cysticercosis patients, and to measure NO concentration and IgG level in the patients with cutaneous-muscular and cerebral cysticercosis. MethodsThe intracranial pressure and the tubercle numbers were observed in 40 cases of cutaneous-muscular cysticercosis and in 42 cases of neurocysticercosis (cerebral) cysticercosis respectively, and the NO concentration and the IgG level of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured. The cutaneous-muscular cysticercosis patients were allotted to two groups by the number of tubercles, i.e. less-tubercle group (the number of tubercles<15) and more-tubercle group (≥15). The cerebral cysticercosis patients were allotted to two groups by the values of intracranial pressure, i.e. normal pressure group (<180 mmHO2) and intracranial hypertension group (≥180 mmHO2). Another 23 patients with varicosis of great saphenous vein were selected to form control group. ResultsThe No concentration and the IgG level in serum of cutaneous-muscular cysticercosis patients and those in serum and CSF of cerebral cysticercosis patients significantly increased as compared with that of the control group. There was a positive correlation between NO concentration and IgG level in the serum of cutaneous-muscular cysticercosis patients or in the CSF of cerebral cysticercosis patients. The NO concentration in the CSF in the neurocysticercosis patients with intracranial hypertension was clearly higher than that of those without intracranial hypertension (P<0.05). As compared with less-tubercle group, the NO level in the serum of more-tubercle group increased significantly (P<0.05). ConclusionNO plays an important role in the acute immune response to cysticercosis, in which cutaneous-muscular tissue and cerebral nerve system are involved. The severity of clinical manifestation may be correlative to NO concentration.",

The uniformity of key switching parameters is improved significantly in the Al-doped HfO2 devices.

The goal of this research is to construct a high level human BMP2 (hBMP2) expression system using transgenic tobacco plants as a bioreactor. Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) enhancer, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) enhancer, matrix attachment regions (MARs) sequence, and \"Kozak\" sequence were used to construct recombinant expression vectors and the high-expression vectors were screened out through GUS-fusions assay. The promoter is the most important factor; double-CaMV 35S promoter is more effective than single promoter. The AMV or TMV enhancer is able to promote the foreign protein expression. After four-step purification, the activated hBMP2 (0.02% total soluble protein) was obtained. Our results suggested that the transgenic tobacco has great potential to be used as a bioreactor to produce hBMP2.",

        "abstract": " Temporal bone chondrosarcoma (TBC) are uncommon primary temporal bone malignancies, and clinicians lack experience in its diagnosis and treatment. The optimal management of patients with tumor of TBC also remains a topic of debate and controversy.  This article summarizes the experience of diagnosis and treatment of TBC, in order to improve the quality of life of cancer patients in the future.  We conducted a retrospective analysis of 10 patients who were referred to our hospital from June 2009 to June 2018 for the treatment of TBC.  There were 3 males and 7 females. The most common presenting symptoms were facial paresis (50%) and hearing loss (40%), whereas otalgia (10%), vertigo (10%) and headache (10%) were less common. All tumors originated from the temporal bone, and 80% involved the jugular foramen area. All patients survived without evidence of disease at a median time of follow up of 28.8 months.  TBC mostly originated in the middle ear mastoid area, and easily extended to the jugular foramen area. An individualized surgical procedure that removes tumors integrally with minimal nerve and blood vessel damage provides long-term cancer control and minimal morbidity in most cases.",

        "abstract": "Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) is widely used in preventing acute rejection in liver transplantation. Only free MPA (fMPA) can exert the pharmacological effect. In this study, we aimed to develop the new model which could be best fit to predict the fMPA area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by limited sampling strategy (LSS) in Chinese liver transplant patients. Fifty patients received MMF with the combination of tacrolimus. Free MPA concentrations were determined around day 7. Optimal subset regression analysis was used to establish the models for estimated fMPA AUC(0-12h). Three excellent better models were validated by Bootstrap analysis. Twenty-four models including four blood time point samplings were established. For the selected four models, 100% were successful and were not significantly different from the original dataset by Bootstrap analysis. The best model for prediction of fMPA AUC(0-12h) was by using C(1h), C(2h), C(4h) and C(6h). This model showed the minimal mean prediction error and the minimal mean absolute prediction error. In conclusion, the models for estimation of the fMPA AUC(0-12h) were established in liver transplant recipients and the best model for prediction of fMPA AUC was: estimated fMPA AUC=34.2+1.12C(1h)+1.29C(2h)+2.28C(4h)+3.95C(6h).",

The main circuit of APF is based on diode-clamp three-level topology. The vector mode one-cycle control strategy is employed. The mathematic model and control object equation of the proposed APF are established, and system stability and design of PI regulator are investigated in detail. In addition, the difference and relation of the vector mode one-cycle control between 30°-390° and 0°-360° are compared. Finally simulation and experiments are implemented for the proposed APF to operate under balanced and unbalanced conditions of three-phase power supply. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed APF can compensate the harmonics and reactive currents commendably and effectively, and verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed control strategy.",

A novel adaptive NN backstepping output-feedback control approach is first proposed for nonlinear nonstrict-feedback systems. The monotonicity of system bounding functions and the structure character of radial basis function (RBF) NNs are used to overcome the difficulties that arise from nonstrict-feedback structure. A state observer is constructed to estimate the immeasurable state variables. By combining adaptive backstepping technique with approximation capability of radial basis function NNs, an output-feedback adaptive NN controller is designed through backstepping approach. It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees semiglobal boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop systems. Two examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultured mES cells are in a very different 2D niche from the in vivo equivalent-inner cell mass (ICM). Because the cell fate decision could be regulated by many cues which could be impacted by geometry, the traditional 2D culture system would hamper us from understanding the in vivo situations correctly. Three-dimensional (3D) scaffold was believed to provide a 3D environment closed to the in vivo one. In this work, three different scaffolds were prepared for cell culture. Several characters of mES cells were changed under 3D scaffolds culture compared to 2D, and these changes were mainly due to the alteration in geometry but not the matrix. The self-renewal of mES cells was promoted by the introducing of dimensionality. The stemness maintenance of mES was supported by all three 3D scaffolds without feeder cells in the long-time culture. Our findings demonstrated that the stemness maintenance of mES cells was promoted by the 3D geometry of scaffolds and this would provide a promising platform for ES cell research.",

Human OCT4 can generate two isoforms OCT4A and OCT4B by alternative splicing. OCT4B1 is a recently discovered novel OCT4 spliced variant, which has been considered as a putative marker of stemness. Compared with the OCT4B mRNA, OCT4B1 mRNA is generated by retaining intron 2 as a cryptic exon which contains a TGA stop codon in it. As a result, the protein product of OCT4B1 mRNA could be truncated. Interestingly, we present here that OCT4B1 can indirectly produce the same protein products as OCT4B. We have demonstrated that OCT4B1 mRNA can be spliced into OCT4B mRNA, and encode three protein isoforms. The splicing of OCT4B1 mRNA into OCT4B mRNA can be remarkably inhibited by the mutation of the classical splicing site. Our result suggests that OCT4B mRNA may originate from OCT4B1 mRNA by alternative splicing.",

        "abstract": "XMM-Newton observations of the polar SDSSJ155331.12+551614.5 reveal that all\nthe X-ray flux emerges at energies less than 2 keV. The best fit to the\nspectrum is with a thermal plasma with kT=0.8 keV plus a 20-90 ev black body,\nyielding a thermal X-ray luminosity of 8-9.5E28 ergs/s. The low temperature and\nX-ray luminosity, together with the lack of variation of the X-ray flux during\nthe observations, are all consistent with an extremely low accretion rate that\nputs the system in the bombardment regime of accretion, rather than accretion\ninvolving a standoff shock. It is likely that the observed X-rays originate\nfrom the M dwarf secondary star, thus providing a base activity level for late\nmain sequence stars in close binaries. SDSSJ132411.57+032050.5 is detected by\nXMM-Newton at the faint EPIC pn count rate of 0.0012 c/s, giving an upper limit\nto the X-ray luminosity of 7E28 ergs/s for a distance of 300 pc, which is also\nconsistent with the above scenario.",

Unlike the commonly used quadratic cost function in- volving the state, a cost function involving the delayed state is considered. This naturally leads to a memory state feedback such that the resulting closed-loop system is not only asymptotically stable but also guarantees an adequate level of performance even with an admissible class of uncertainties. A sufficient condition for the existence of a guaranteed cost controller is given in terms of the feasibility condition of a linear matrix inequality. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed in this paper.",

        "abstract": "The preclinical studies using animal models play a very important role in the evaluation of facial nerve regeneration. Good models need to recapitulate the distance and time for axons to regenerate in humans. Compared with the most used rodent animals, the structure of facial nerve in mini-pigs shares more similarities with humans in microanatomy. To evaluate the feasibility of repairing facial nerve defects by collagen scaffolds combined with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), 10-mm-long gaps were made in the buccal branch of mini-pigs' facial nerve. Three months after surgery, electrophysiological assessment and histological examination were performed to evaluate facial nerve regeneration. Immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscope observation showed that collagen scaffolds with collagen binding (CBD)-CNTF could promote better axon regeneration, Schwann cell migration, and remyelination at the site of implant device than using scaffolds alone. Electrophysiological assessment also showed higher recovery rate in the CNTF group. In summary, combination of collagen scaffolds and CBD-CNTF showed promising effects on facial nerve regeneration in mini-pig models.",

The charts of 56 pediatric cochlear implant recipients were retrospectively reviewed. Parental interviews were conducted to collect information regarding the factors that potentially impact early CI in Chinese children. The mean age at CI was 40.98 months, and the median age was 24 months. Thirty patients received an implant before 24 months of age, and the other 26 patients received the implant after 24 months of age. By univariate logistic regression analysis, newborn hearing screening (NHS), financial burden impacted early CI significantly (p < 0.05), while the multivariate analysis indicated that only NHS significantly influenced the early CI (p < 0.05). The following factors were associated with a moderately increased risk of late implantation: lack of NHS [odds ratio (OR) = 5.833], living in a rural community (OR = 2.714), and communication barriers (OR = 2.691). Living in a rural community, financial burden and communication barriers negatively impact the age at CI, whereas NHS positively influence the age at CI. Increased awareness of these factors could promote early CI and improve the quality of life of congenitally deaf children.",

Since most preclinical anti-glioma drug tests still rely on conventional 2D cell culture, we established a collagen scaffold for 3D glioma cell culture. Glioma cells cultured on these 3D scaffolds showed greater degree of dedifferentiation and quiescence than cells in 2D culture. 3D-cultured cells also exhibited enhanced resistance to chemotherapeutic alkylating agents, with a much higher proportion of glioma stem cells and upregulation of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Importantly, tumor cells in 3D culture showed chemotherapy resistance patterns similar to those observed in glioma patients. Our results suggest that 3D collagen scaffolds are promising in vitro research platforms for screening new anti-glioma therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Leaf nitrogen content is an important index to evaluate and estimate crop growth status,yield and quality.Real-time and non-destructive measurement of nitrogen nutrition status of plants is useful for nitrogen fertilizer management in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production.The objectives of this study were to determine the relationships of ground-based canopy spectral reflectance,spectral index and color parameters obtained by using common digital camera (Olympus C-5060) and imaging spectrometer (MSI200),with canopy leaf nitrogen content,and to develop regression models for estimating leaf nitrogen content in cotton.The results showed that canopy spectral reflectance decreased with increasing leaf nitrogen content,and the bands sensitive to leaf nitrogen content occurred the green and red regions mainly.Furthermore,the models to retrieve canopy leaf nitrogen contents using DI (R580,R680) and G-R were most feasible with the maximum determination coefficients (R2) and the minimum standard error (SE) for two visible sensors,respectively.Additional,b (CIE 1976 Lab color model) and H (HSI color model) were the optimum color parameters.On the whole,for the fitting effects,the spectral index was superior to color parameters for the same sensor,and MSI200 superior to digital camera.Then,the prediction performances of the spectral indices of digital camera were validated by using independent dataset.We found that difference indices DI (R580,R680) and G-R were the optimum indicators of canopy leaf nitrogen content with the highest predictive precision (0.8131 and 0.7636,respectively) and accuracy (1.0149 and 0.9661) and the lowest RMSE (2.3313 and 2.7406 mg g-1,approximately 6.52% and 8.24% of the mean).Hence,canopy spectral parameters in visible region may provide an effective and feasible means of estimating canopy leaf nitrogen contents quantitatively in cotton field.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAs an environmentally friendly construction technique, modern rammed earth generally stabilized with portland cement has attracted growing interest recently. In this study, cement-based composites (CSCN) consisting of cement, sodium silicate, and composite promoter were used for substituting portland cement, and the effect of fly ash was investigated by unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test, thermogravimetric analysis (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Based on the theory of pozzolanic and dispersing (Pu0026D) effects, the contribution of fly ash was regarded as an addition of CSCN, and the quantitative analysis of Pu0026D effects defined as Pu0026D factors was evaluated by the clay-water/CSCN ratio hypothesis. It was found that the Pu0026D factors for both compressive strength and secant modulus varied with CSCN content and curing age. The models of different curing ages for predicting the strength and modulus of specimens stabilized with CSCN and fly ash were developed f...",

The correlation between pigment contents of cotton leaves with Verticillium wilt and spectra reflectance, the first derivative of reflectance and spectral characteristic parameters were analyzed respectively. The estimation models about leaves pigment contents of disease cotton were established and tested. The results indicated that the correlations were best significant between chlorophyll a, b and a+b contents of leaves and spectral reflectance in visible wave bands, the first derivative spectrum at the wavelength regions of blue edge, yellow edge and red edge, and all spectral characteristic parameters (excluding red edge swing Dr). The models of transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (TCAR) and the new model of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI [702,758]) had best estimated precision, and the relative errors were in average within 1.3%. Given that the model of NDVI [702,758] is very simple and practical, it was commended as a best model to estimate chlorophyll a, b and a+b contents of disease cotton. This study shows that leaves hyperspectra data can be used to estimate the pigment contents of cotton leaves quantitatively. This conclusion has also great practice and application value for monitoring the growth state and disease influence evaluation on cotton by using hyperspectral remote sensing.",

        "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is still a worldwide clinical challenge for which there is no viable therapeutic method. We focused on developing combinatorial methods targeting the complex pathological process of SCI. In this study, we implanted linear-ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) fibers with collagen binding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by tagging a collagen-binding domain (CBD) (LOCS + CBD-BDNF) in completely transected canine SCI with multisystem rehabilitation to validate its potential therapeutic effect through a long-term (38 weeks) observation. We found that LOCS + CBD-BDNF implants strikingly promoted locomotion and functional sensory recovery, with some dogs standing unassisted and transiently moving. Further histological analysis showed that administration of LOCS + CBD-BDNF reduced lesion volume, decreased collagen deposits, promoted axon regeneration and improved myelination, leading to functional recovery. Collectively, LOCS + CBD-BDNF showed striking therapeutic effect on completely transected canine SCI model and it is the first time to report such breakthrough in the war with SCI. Undoubtedly, it is a potentially promising therapeutic method for SCI paralysis or other movement disorders caused by neurological diseases in the future.",

        "abstract": "Much research has focused on developing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) delivery systems to enhance angiogenesis in wound repair and in tissue engineering. Collagen can be used as a delivery system because of its biocompatibility, but its fast degradation rate and limited affinity with growth factors are disadvantageous for maintaining a sufficient growth factor concentration at injury sites. To enhance VEGF binding to collagen scaffolds and reduce the collagen degradation rate we found a simple way to modify porous collagen scaffolds by chemical addition of sulfhydryl groups, which then allow both cross-linking of the collagen fibers with each other and the immobilization of more VEGF in the scaffold after treatment with sulfo-SMCC. We demonstrated that cross-linking led to a slower degradation rate of the collagen scaffolds, while cellularization was improved by both cross-linking and the presence of VEGF. On the other hand, angiogenesis was increased only moderately by cross-linking, but significantly more by the presence of immobilized VEGF. We conclude that collagen scaffolds chemically conjugated to VEGF by Traut's reagent and sulfo-SMCC is an effective delivery system in wound repair and tissue engineering.",

Laminin is a rich extra cellular matrix in the central nervous system, and is highly expressed in the ischemic region after cerebral ischemia. We reported here by fusing with laminin-binding domain (LBD) to BDNF to construct laminin-binding BDNF (LBD-BDNF). LBD-BDNF could target accumulated laminin in the ischemic region and exert targeting therapy of injured neurons after ischemia. We examined the laminin-binding ability and neurotrophic bioactivity of LBD-BDNF in vitro, and assessed its targeting therapy using a rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in vivo. It was found that LBD-BDNF could specifically bind to laminin and maintain BDNF activity both in vitro and in vivo. LBD-BDNF treatment attenuated neural-degeneration after MCAO, and also resulted in a reduction of infarct volume that is associated with a parallel improvement in neurological functional outcome and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of hippocamp.",

The readout destruction of recording at the left side was much smaller than that of recording at the right side.",

        "abstract": "P-glycoprotein is localized at the apical brush-border membrane of the proximal renal tubule and functions as extruding toxins and xenobiotics out of cells. The difference of P-glycoproteinos function resulted from single nucleotide polymorphisms in MDR1 (multidrug resistance gene encoding for P-gp) and may be the cause of interindividual differences in susceptibility to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The purpose of this study is to compare the genotype frequency of C3435T and G1199A polymorphisms in MDR1 between ESRD patients and healthy controls in the Chinese population to determine whether the alteration of the P-gp function is associated with ESRD.Two hundred and eighty-four healthy Chinese controls and 244 Chinese patients with ESRD were involved in this study. Allele specific PCR and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay were used to determine the genotype MDR1 G1199A and C3435T, respectively.The genotype distribution of 3435CC, 3435CT, and 3435TT were 0.35, 0.50, and 0.15, respectively, in the control group and 0.38, 0.47, and 0.15 in the group with the ESRD patients. No variant allele 1199G>A was found in any of the patients. The value of serum creatinine for genotypes 3435CC, 3435CT, and 3435TT in the ESRD patients were 753.8+/-276.0 mumol/L, 849.6+/-342.2 micromol/L, and 987.0+/-512.0 micromol/L, respectively. The difference between 3435TT and 3435CC reached statistical significance (P<0.05).The low expression of P-glycoprotein was not the etiological factor for the kidney disease, but it may contribute to the progression of ESRD and affect the severity. Chinese people do not carry the 1199G>A variant allele. More studies are needed to clarify the cause and interindividual differences in the susceptibility for the risk of ESRD.",

The interaction between the formyl group of its ring-closed isomer with cysteine/homocysteine caused a notable change in its absorption spectrum, accompanied by an evident color change from blue to pale yellow upon addition of cysteine/homocysteine. Moreover, the competition tests revealed that no obvious interference was observed by performing the titrations with the mixtures of cysteine/homocysteine and other amino acids.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) combined with a bladder acellular matrix (BAM) for bladder regeneration. A BAM or BAM loaded with hADSCs (BAM/hADSCs) was used to repair partial cystectomy of the bladder in a canine model. 6 months after implantation, calculi and urine leakage were not found in either the BAM or BAM/hADSCs group by cystography. And compared to the BAM group, a significant increase of maximum bladder volume and bladder compliance was observed in the BAM/hADSCs group by urodynamics evaluation. Moreover, histological analysis showed that the BAM/hADSCs group could more effectively promote the regeneration of bladder smooth muscle and vascularization than the BAM group. These results demonstrated that a BAM/hADSCs could be an effective approach to promote bladder reconstruction with potential clinical applications.",

The patients were staged according to the modified Pittsburgh staging system. Thirteen patients with T1 stage underwent local resection (LR), 6 patients with T1 stage underwent lateral temporal bone resection (LTBR), and 8 patients with T1 stage underwent LTBR including superficial parotidectomy (SP). Two patients with T2 stage underwent LTBR, and 1 patient with T2 stage underwent LTBR+SP. Three patients with T3 stage underwent LTBR. One patient with T4 stage underwent LTBR, two patients with T4 stage underwent subtotal temporal bone resection (STBR), and 7 patients with T4 stage underwent LTBR+SP.Of all patients that underwent surgery, 13 died of their primary cancers during the follow-up time. The 5-year survival rates of patients with T stages 1 through 4 were 85%, 67%, 67%, and 30%, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in 5-year survival rate between T1 and other stages (T2, T3, T4) using the log-rank test (p<0.05). There was significant difference in 5-year survival rate between T4 and other stages using the log-rank test (p<0.05). The 5-year survival rates after LR, LTBR or LTBR plus SP for T1 were 77%, 87% and 100%, respectively. The 5-year survival rates after LTBR, STBR or LTBR plus SP for T4 were 0%, 50% and 29%, respectively. The 5-year survival rates for 19 patients with clear surgical margins and 24 patients with positive margins were 89% and 54%, respectively. The 5-year survival rates of patients with radiotherapy and without radiotherapy were 62% and 86%, respectively.An en bloc resection including superficial parotidectomy is favored in an effort to produce negative surgical margins for ACC of the EAC. Adjunctive radiotherapy is used for patients with positive margins and in advanced lesions.",

Fuzzy logic systems are directly used to approximate unknown and desired control signals and a novel direct adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is constructed via backstepping. The proposed adaptive fuzzy controller guarantees that the output of the closed-loop system converges to a small neighborhood of the reference signal and all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded. A main advantage of the proposed controller is that it contains only one adaptive parameter that needs to be updated online.

However, its expression regulation largely remains unknown. In this study we show that Nogo receptor (NgR) participates in the regulation of Nanog expression via Stat3 pathway. Activation of NgR results in the phosphorylation of Stat3 and increases expression levels of Nanog mRNA and protein, which inhibits differentiation of embryoid bodies. This up-regulation of Nanog can be abolished by NgR inhibitor PI-PLC and NEP1-40, or phospho-Stat3 inhibitor AG490 and rapamycin. Immunofluorescence assay demonstrates that NgR and its ligand Nogo-A/B exist on mouse blastocysts and cultured ES cells, suggesting NgR might play a role in early embryo development.",

Based on a Lyapunov function approach, we give admissible conditions for open-loop fuzzy systems. In addition, relaxed admis- sible conditions and fuzzy controller design scheme are also derived by con- sidering the property of the time derivative of premise membership functions. All the conditions are formulated in the format of linear matrix inequality. At last, an example is given to illustrate that the new su-cient conditions is less conservative than the results given by previous literature.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate a new composite biomaterial for reconstruction of a 2 × 2.5 cm full-thickness abdominal wall defect. In this study, the collagen membrane was activated with the engineered human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). To enhance the binding of bFGF to collagen membranes, a specific peptide of collagen-binding domain (CBD) was fused to the N-terminal of bFGF. After implantation, little adhesion was caused in collagen/CBD-bFGF, collagen/NAT-bFGF and collagen/PBS groups. Moreover, collagen/CBD-bFGF group could effectively promote the vascularization at 30 d after surgery and significantly accelerate the integration of myofibers into the collagen material at 90 d after surgery compared to the other two groups. Due to the replacement of the myofibers in materials, the mechanical strength of implanted biomaterials in collagen/CBD-bFGF group was also greater than the other two groups at 90 d after surgery. Thus, the collagen/CBD-bFGF composite biomaterial was promising for the treatment of full-thickness abdominal wall defect.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that several mechanisms, including numerous inhibitory molecules, weak neurotrophic stimulation and deficient intrinsic regenerative responses, collectively contribute to the failure of mature spinal cord axon regeneration. Thus, combinatorial therapies targeting multiple mechanisms have attracted much attention. In the present study, a porous collagen scaffold was used to support neuronal attachment and bridge axonal regeneration. The scaffold was specifically functionalized using neutralizing proteins (CBD-EphA4LBD, CBD-PlexinB1LBD and NEP1-40) and collagen-binding neurotrophic factors (CBD-BDNF and CBD-NT3) to simultaneously antagonize myelin inhibitory molecules (ephrinB3, Sema4D and Nogo) and exert neurotrophic protection and stimulation. Cerebellar granular neurons cultured on the functionalized collagen scaffold promoted neurite outgrowth in the presence of myelin. Furthermore, a full combinatorial treatment comprising functionalized scaffold implantation and cAMP administration was developed to evaluate the synergistic repair ability in a rat T10 complete removal spinal cord injury model. The results showed that full combinatorial therapy exhibited the greatest advantage in reducing the volume of cavitation, facilitating axonal regeneration, and promoting neuronal generation. The newborn neurons generated in the lesion area could form the neuronal relay and enhance the locomotion recovery after severe spinal cord injury.",

In contrast to the conventional Boost PFC converter, some disadvantages of the Boost PFC converter are overcome, and the switching loss and the stress of the main switch are reduced. In addition, with the one-cycle control, the multipliers and the voltage sensors used in the traditional direct current control are eliminated, the control circuit is simple and high efficiency. The power circuit topology and the operation principle of the proposed converter are described in detail in this paper. An experimental example is presented, and the parameters of the power circuit and the control loop are designed and optimized, and the system stability is analyzed. The results of the simulation and experimentation are provided that the power factor is close to unity and the total harmonic distortion(THD) is low, the experimental results verify the feasibility and validity of the power circuit topology and control strategy of the proposed converter. © 2006 IEEE.",

Utilizing the derived analytical solvable Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) model and Euler–Lagrange equation, a calculable method for minimizing the dynamic energy of STT-MRAM is founded. Experimentally, a write energy reduction by 30% is demonstrated in the context of a certain write error rate.

Since the last major reviews, several advances have occurred. First, demonstrations of the heat-shock response outside the laboratory now include many additional taxa and environments. Many of these demonstrations are only correlative, however. More importantly, technical advances in \"omic\" quantification of nucleic acids and proteins, genome-wide association analysis, and manipulation of genes and their expression have enabled the field to move beyond correlation. Several consequent advances are already evident: The pathway from heat-shock gene expression to stress tolerance in nature can be extremely complex, mediated through multiple biological processes and systems, and even multiple species. The underlying genes are more numerous, diverse, and variable than previously appreciated, especially with respect to their regulatory variation and epigenetic changes. The impacts and limitations (e.g., due to trade-offs) of natural selection on these genes have become more obvious and better established. Finally, as evolutionary capacitors Hsps may have distinctive impacts on the evolution of other genes and ecological consequences. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the problems of robust stabilization and robust H∞ control for a class of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neutral delay systems with norm-bounded time-varying parameter uncertainties. Attention is focused on the design of a fuzzy state feedback controller, which is implemented by utilizing the so-called parallel distributed compensation scheme. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of these problems are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When these LMIs are feasible, an explicit expression of the desired fuzzy state feedback gains is also given. Finally, a simulation example is provided,to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design approach. © 2004 EUCA.",

The diarylethene exhibited favorable photochromism with remarkable fatigue resistance in both solution and the crystalline phase. The interaction between the di-2-picolylamine with Zn2+ caused a notable change in its fluorescence intensity, accompanied by an evident color change from the black to bright blue upon addition of Zn2+. No obvious interference was observed by performing the titrations with other metal ions. The results revealed that the photochromic diarylethene could be used as a fluorescence probe for the recognition of Zn2+ with high selectivity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Dynamic Bayesian network is used to establish the relationship between blade machining operations to realize the control of the whole machining process. The causal relation between the elements in the main process factor set that affects blade machining operations is built by Bayesian network. The control chart T 2 is used to monitor the factor set of each operation to judge whether the operation is out of control or not. While tracing error sources, the T 2 statistics of the samples out of control are decomposed according to causal variables described by aforementioned causal relation, and the decomposed variable control limits are built as error source judgment conditions are built. A simulation study on a blade machining process is carried out, which demonstrates that the proposed method is reasonable.",

The study included 4 such patients who had undergone clinical and laboratory investigations, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments followed by surgical procedures and pathological evaluation. Their major symptoms were otorrhea, otalgia, tinnitus, and profound hearing loss. Imaging studies showed an osteolytic soft mass with calcified debris in the inner ear, and the bony labyrinth was eroded partly or completely by granulation mass, with loss of bony morphology. Further pathological examination was coincident with inflammatory granulation tissue with some calcification or osseous tissue. The disease process is attributed to chronic osteomyelitis due to the presence of osteonecrosis. Prompt CT and MRI examinations and optimal therapeutic management facilitate definitive diagnosis and protect against fatal complications.",

Each of the diarylethenes exhibited evident photochromism and functioned as a remarkable fluorescent switch in both solution and PMMA films. Their photoconversion ratios were larger than 90%, and the fluorescent modulation efficiencies were greater than 88% in the photostationary state. The absorption maxima, quantum yields of cyclization and cycloreversion, and band-gaps of the closed-ring isomers increased whereas the emission intensity and band-gaps of the open-ring isomers greatly decreased when the fluorine atom was attached at any of the three positions on the terminal benzene ring. Cyclic voltammograms suggested that the oxidation onsets and band-gaps of the open-ring isomers were much bigger than those of the closed-ring isomers. The fluorine atom and its substituted position could availably modulate their optical and electrochemical behaviors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

OBJECTIVE: To observe the mechanical properties and histocompatibility of decellularized vascular xenograft vascular grafts constructed by the improved enzymatic method. METHODS: Porcine carotid arteries were decellularized using conventional trypsin-EDTA plus 1% TritonX-100 and 0.1% ammonia in order for 4, 5, and 6 hours. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Porcine carotid arteries were decellularized by trypsin, ammonium hydroxide and non-ionic detergent to extract all the cell components of the grafts successfully. To obtain better pore size and porosity of the acellular scaffold, we changed the methods by extending the time of trypsin. By extending the time of trypsin methods, the better pore size and porosity of the acellular scaffold was obtained. Biomechanics, porosity characteristics of scaffold can meet the requirements of tissue engineered vessel.",

Our result indicates that the $Xi_b(6227)^-$ is a good candidate of the $P$-wave $Xi_b^{prime}$ state with $J^P=3/2^-$ or $5/2^-$. In addition, we further provide the information of the properties of the partners of the $Xi_b(6227)^-$. These predicted states include three $2S$ states and the remaining $1P$ states in the bottom-strange baryon family. The calculated sizable Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka$-$allowed decay widths of these partners show that the experimental search for them becomes possible via LHCb. We have a reason to believe that the present study can be treated as a start point for constructing the highly excited bottom baryon spectroscopy.",

Seven cases underwent ascending aorta to bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) bypass, 38 cases to the axillary artery with graft to single ICA bypass. Six cases underwent ascending aorta to axillary bypass with 3 graft to single ICA bypasses as the second stage surgery. Three cases underwent ascending aorta to right ICA bypass with 2 graft to left ICA bypasses as well as 6 subclavian to carotid bypass, PTA in 5 and stenting in 3 cases, etc.Twenty-seven patients with less clinical severity received conservative therapy, 9 of them had mostly temporarily improvement, 15 had slight improvement or basically no change, 1 had hemiplegia and 2 died of stroke and myocardial infarction respectively. Surgically, the short-term effective rate was 87% and operative death 7.8%. Fifty-five patients were followed up, a mean follow-up time was 48 months, and the follow-up rate was 80.9%. The excellently, good, fair, no change and death rate were 36.4%, 38.2%, 20.0%, 3.6% and 1.8% respectively. All patients with PTA or stent had an immediate good response and all recurred within 3 to 5 months.For treating severe cerebral ischemia caused by Takayasu's arteritis, the ascending aorta to axillary and single ICA reconstruction or the ascending aorta-bilateral axillary bypass for patients with subclavian steal syndrome is advocated; second stage operation from graft to contralateral ICA can be carried out if necessary.",

Current researches have extensively focused on the study of utilizing biomaterial-based 3-D culture systems to study and direct stem-cell fate both in vitro and in vivo. Here in our study, we screened the differential expression patterns of miRNAs between 2-D cultured and 3-D cultured NPCs using microarray analysis. Among these differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-20 was found to increase during differentiation of NPCs. Specifically, the facilitative effect on neural differentiation of miR-20 is mediated, at least in part by directly target the Rest gene, which is essential for preventing neural differentiation and maintaining NPCs self-renewal. Furthermore, the expression of miR-20 was decreased when the WNT pathway was inhibited by knock down of β-catenin or by exogenous Dkk protein, whereas it increased when the WNT pathway was activated by exogenous Wnt3a protein. Overall, miR-20, Rest and Wnt signaling are suggested to be involved in a regulatory circuit that can modulate the neural differention of NPCs. This novel regulatory circuit provides additional insight into how microRNAs interact with signaling molecules during neural differentiation of NPCs, allowing for fine-tuning of intricate cellular processes.",

In this paper, the transient SHE behaviors in transistors of the advanced technology nodes are discussed. By utilizing the ultra-fast (sub-1ns) measurement technique, I-V characteristics of FinFETs at different switch speeds could be obtained and the real-time channel temperature change is able to be experimentally observed. It has been confirmed that several seconds are required to heat up the channel of transistors. Therefore, in sub-10 nm devices, SHE may be alleviated under high frequency/speed operations and the simulation results also show the similar phenomena and trend.",

        "abstract": "Biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and nitrogen status are important parameters for indicating crop growth potential and photosynthetic productivity in wheat. Nondestructive, quick assessment of leaf dry weight, LAI and nitrogen content is necessary for nitrogen nutrition diagnosis and cultural regulation in wheat production. In order to establish the monitoring model of nitrogen richness in winter wheat of growth anaphase, studying the relationship between the nitrogen richness (NR) containing nitrogen density, LAI and leaf dry weight and the difference of hyperspectral reflectance rates (△R), we conducted a comparable experiment with five winter wheat varieties under nitrogen application level of 0, 100, 200 and 400 kg · N · ha-1. The results indicated the NRs of the different varieties of winter wheat leaves increased with increasing growth stage while in the different nitrogen levels it was sequenced as: N0 > N3 > N1 > N2. Twelve vegetation indices were compared with corresponding NR. The NR had significantly negative correlation to TCARI and VD672 in those vegetation indices, and their correlations (r) arrived at 0.870 and 0.855, respectively. The coefficients of determination (R2) of two models were 0.757 and 0.731 by erecting model with the two indexes and NR. Root mean square error (RMSE), relative error (RE) and determination coefficient between measured and estimated NR were employed to test the model reliability and predicting accuracy. Accuracy rates of the models based on TCARI and VD672 achieved 84.56% and 80.13%. The overall results suggested that leaf nitrogen status of growth anaphase in winter wheat has stable relationships with some vegetation indexes, especially index of TCARI and VD672.",

In this study, we used collagen-binding VEGF in a diabetic rat model to investigate the effects of this new method.We produced a fusion protein (CBD-VEGF) consisting of VEGF and a collagen-binding domain (CBD), which allowed VEGF to bind to collagen. The diabetic rat models were made by injected streptozocin (STZ) peritoneally and removed full thickness skin on the back. All the rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: PBS group (n=24), NAT-VEGF group (n=24), and CBD-VEGF group (n=24). After model establishment, the dissolved drugs were evenly given on the wounds using syringe. The healing rates were calculated and compared among the groups and the tissues of the wound were taken and evaluated for histological analysis.The CBD-VEGF group showed better result in wound healing rate, better vascularization and higher amount of VEGF in the wound granulation tissue compared with NAT-VEGF group and control.Topical application of CBD-VEGF can promote diabetic wound healing in rat model, which could potentially provide a better therapeutic option for diabetic wounds.",

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the non-targeted delivery of VEGF decreases its therapeutic efficacy due to an insufficient local concentration in the ischemic myocardium. In this study, we used a specific peptide to modify VEGF and determined that this modified VEGF (IMT-VEGF) localized to the ischemic myocardium through intravenous injection by interacting with cardiac troponin I (cTnI). When IMT-VEGF was used to mediate cardiac repair in a rat model of ischemia–reperfusion (I–R) injury, we observed a decreased scar size, enhanced angiogenesis and improved cardiac function. Moreover, an alternative treatment using the repeated administration of a low-dose IMT-VEGF also promoted angiogenesis and functional recovery. The therapeutic effects of IMT-VEGF were further confirmed in a pig model of MI as the result of the conserved properties of its interacting protein, cTnI. These results suggest a promising therapeutic strategy for MI based on the targeted delivery of IMT-VEGF.",

This study investigates the mechanical and microstructural properties of alkali-activated fly ash (FA) based geopolymers cured at various RH ratios at 75 °C. Compressive and flexural strength tests were conducted to determine the mechanical properties, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests were carried out to study the microstructural properties of the mixtures. The study revealed that both compressive and flexural strengths improved when RH was set at 70%. The microstructural analysis indicated a mixture of unreacted fly ash particles, some crystals, and a reacted gel phases as the geopolymerization products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The use of renewable and bio-based composites is of great importance in the construction industry as they promote the sustainability due to their environment-friendly nature. Hemp-based concretes have been of great interest and prominent bio-composites in the recent years owing to their superior hygroscopic and thermal properties, however, they have inadequate mechanical strength. This research investigates a new type of bio-composite based on the mixture of magnesium phosphate cement (MPC), fly ash (FA) and corn stalk (CS). The study determines the feasibility of using this composite as an insulation and structural material. Several concrete mixtures were formulated with different concentrations (varying from 5% to 30% CS content) and two sizes of corn stalk (LCS and SCS) to develop corn stalk magnesium phosphate cement concrete (CS-MPC concrete). The compressive strength, thermal conductivity, capillary water uptake and water absorption properties of all the bio-composites were investigated. The study concluded that CS-MPC concrete falls in the category of lightweight concrete, and exhibited the improved thermal ( λ  = 0.0510 and 0.0986 W.m −1 .K −1  with 30% CS content for LCS-MPC and SCS-MPC concrete) and mechanical properties (fc’ = 6.98 MPa and 9.44 MPa with 20% CS content for LCS-MPC and SCS-MPC concrete; fc’ = 1.75 MPa and 2.60 MPa with 30% CS content for LCS-MPC and SCS-MPC concrete) which are imperative for non-structural and structural applications. Moreover, CS-MPC composites also showed better hygroscopic performance (capillary water uptake) in comparison to previous studies. Morphology of CS-MPC composite by SEM revealed that CS and binder had good interaction with each other during the hydration process. Finally, it was concluded that CS as plant aggregate and MPC as binder with advanced thermal and mechanical properties are better alternatives as compared to hemp hurd and cement or lime for production of bio-composite. Further tests to determine the important properties of this bio-composite are also under consideration.",

        "abstract": "Treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a clinical challenge worldwide because of the complicated inhibitory microenvironment formed post-injury, reduced axonal regenerative ability of spinal cord neurons, and scarcity of endogenous neurogenesis within the lesion center. Taxol, in addition to stabilizing microtubules, has shown potential for decreasing axonal degeneration and reducing scar formation after SCI in rodents. In this study, we further verified the therapeutic effects and clinical potential of Taxol on restriction of scar formation and promotion of neuronal regeneration and functional recovery after severe spinal cord transection in a large animal (canine) model. A linear-ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) combined with Taxol was implanted into the injury site after the complete removal of 1 cm of spinal tissue. Afterwards, diligent nursing and multi-system rehabilitation were carried out during a half-year period of observation. The results showed that LOCS + Taxol implantation markedly promoted motor-evoked potentials and locomotion recovery. Moreover, histological analysis demonstrated that LOCS + Taxol implantation significantly increased neurogenesis and axon regeneration to reconnect the spinal cord stumps. Additionally, reduced glial scar formation was observed within the lesion site. Thus, LOCS + Taxol implantation treatment is a promising combinatorial therapy for the treatment of acute long-distance spinal cord defects.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate electrical characterizations within sub-1 ns to investigate the self-heating effect (SHE) in 14 nm FinFETs, for the first time. Thanks to the extremely fast I-V measurement speed (∼500 ps), the heat generation and dissipation process in the transistor channel are precisely captured. Furthermore, the unique correlation between channel temperature and drain current at different gate and drain biases is obtained. With this correlation, the transient and static channel temperatures could be extracted for devices with any working conditions and switching speeds. The impact of SHE on HCI degradation under real circuit stress is also investigated, showing that even under high frequency working conditions (GHz with random signals), SHE still has significant impact on HCI degradation in 14 nm FinFETs.",

Further investigations demonstrated VEGF transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) to promote spinal cord NSCs proliferation. In vivo, we injected VEGF into spinal cord by laminectomy to confirm the roles of VEGF-VEGFR2-EGFR signals in NSCs activation. VEGF significantly elevated the number of activated NSCs and increased EGFR phosphorylation. In contrast, intraspinal injection of specific inhibitors targeting EGFR and VEGFR2 decreased NSCs activation after SCI. Our results demonstrate that VEGF-VEGFR2-EGFR axis is important for NSCs activation after SCI, providing new insights into the mechanisms of spinal cord NSCs activation postinjury.",

        "abstract": "Four new photochromic diarylethenes, each bearing an indole moiety, were synthesized and three of their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Under alternating irradiation with UV and visible light, the compounds showed favorable photochromism in hexane, PMMA films and the crystalline phase. The cyclization quantum yields gradually increased and the molar absorption coefficients of the closed-ring isomers decreased going from the ortho- to meta- to the para-position of the substitution. The absorption maxima showed little change when the methoxy group was attached at any of the three positions on the terminal benzene ring. Each of the compounds displayed high fluorescence efficiency and remarkable fatigue resistance in both solution and PMMA films by photoirradiation. Of particular note, their fluorescent modulation efficiency could be achieved ca. 90% in solid media. Cyclic voltammograms testified that the methoxy group and its substituted position could effectively modulate the electrochemical behaviors of these diarylethenes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The study presents the use of fly ash for fully replacing sand to produce foamed concrete. Fine silica fume and polypropylene (PP) fiber were used to improve properties of foamed concrete. Lightweight foamed concretes with a wide range of concrete densities (800-1;500 kg=m 3) were studied mainly for compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and drying shrinkage. The results indicate that foamed concrete with a density of 800-1;500 kg=m 3 and compressive strength of 10-50 MPa can be made by using silica fume and PP fiber. Fine silica fume and PP fiber greatly improved the compressive strength of foamed concrete. In addition, adding PP fiber significantly improved the splitting tensile strength and drying shrinkage resistance. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

        "abstract": "The global epidemic of tuberculosis (TB), fueled by the growing HIV pandemic, warrants the development of a safe and effective vaccine against TB. We report the construction and characterization of an unlinked double deletion mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv that deletes both the primary attenuating mutation of BCG (Δ RD1 ) and two genes required for the synthesis of pantothenate (Δ panCD ). The M. tuberculosis Δ RD1 Δ panCD (mc 2 6030) mutant undergoes limited replication in mice, and yet is both significantly safer than BCG in immunocompromised mice and also safe in guinea pigs. Additionally, the mc 2 6030 strain does not reactivate in a mouse chemo-immunosuppression model. Importantly, long-lived protective immune responses following immunization with the mc 2 6030 strain prolong the survival of wild type mice, and CD4-deficient mice against an aerosol challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis . Given its overall safety and effectiveness, the mc 2 6030 live attenuated strain should be considered as a human vaccine candidate for protecting both healthy and HIV-infected individuals against TB.",

        "abstract": "Assuming a heavy quark-light diquark picture, we systematically study the mass spectra and strong decays of $1P$ and $2S$ charm and charm-strange baryons by the nonrelativistic constituent quark models. Most of the existing charm and charm-strange baryons can be well explained as $1P$ and $2S$ states in the diquark picture. As for the well-determined states, including $Sigma_c(2455)^{0,+,++}$, $Sigma_c(2520)^{0,+,++}$, $Xi^prime_c(2580)^{0,+}$, $Xi_c(2645)^{0,+}$, $Lambda_c(2595)^+$, $Lambda_c(2625)^+$, $Xi_c(2790)^{0,+}$, and $Xi_c(2815)^{0,+}$, the theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental data. $Sigma_c(2800)^{0,+,++}$ can be assigned to a $Sigma_{c2}(3/2^-)$ or $Sigma_{c2}(5/2^-)$ state. We prefer to interpret the signal $Sigma_c(2850)^0$ as a $2S(1/2^+)$ state although the possibility can not be thoroughly excluded at present that this is the same state as $Sigma_c(2800)^0$. $Lambda_c(2765)^+$ (or $Sigma_c(2765)^+$) could be explained as the $Lambda_c^+(2S)$ state and $Sigma^+_{c1}(1/2^-)$ state, respectively. We propose to measure the branching ratio of $mathcal{B}(Sigma_c(2455)pi)/mathcal{B}(Sigma_c(2520)pi)$ in future, which may disentangle the puzzle of this state. Our results support $Xi_c(2980)^{0,+}$ as the first radial excited state of $Xi_c(2470)^{0,+}$ with $J^P=1/2^+$. The assignment of $Xi_c(2930)^0$ is analogous to $Sigma_c(2800)^{0,+,++}$. Specifically, $Xi_c(2930)^0$ could be a $1P(3/2^-)$ or $1P(5/2^-)$ $Xi_c^prime$ state. Some typical ratios among partial decay widths are provided for experiments to search for these missing states.",

        "abstract": "Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was conjugated with heparin and fabricated into nonwoven tubular scaffold by electrospinning. The dynamic contact angle analysis revealed the hydrophilicity improvement due to heparin concentrating on the conjugate surface. The microbicinchoninic acid and quartz crystal microbalance measurements implied that the conjugate can significantly reduce the absorption of plasma protein, such as albumin and fibrinogen, indicative of the good blood biocompatibility. As evidenced by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay, the electrospun conjugate scaffolds possessed a higher loading capability of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) than that of the blank PCL in aqueous solution via static interaction. The viability of loaded VEGF was evaluated by cell culture and adhesion tests. The amount and morphology of cells were substantially improved after VEGF was loaded into scaffolds exhibiting excellent cell biocompatibility. To assess the in vivo biocompatibility, a tubular scaffold (L = 4 cm, D = 2 mm) was transplanted into dog's femoral artery. The scaffold patency was inspected by carotid artery angiography 4 weeks after implantation. The explanted scaffold was also investigated by histological analysis including hematoxyline eosin, Millere Masson (collagen and elastin), and von Kossa (calcium) stain. Furthermore, von Willebrand factor immunohistochemical stain was performed to examine the formation of endothelial layer. The conjugate shows the potential to be used as scaffold materials in vascular tissue engineering.",

In OCT4B, the single mRNA can generate at least three protein isoforms, OCT4B-164, OCT4B-190, and OCT4B-265, using alternative translation initiation. OCT4B-164 and OCT4B-190 can be translated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated mechanism. Our work previously demonstrated that nucleotides (nt) 102-326 contained an IRES. We have mapped a 30-nt sequence (nt 201-231), which is sufficient to promote internal initiation of translation of OCT4B mRNA. The minimal element contains a sequence unique to OCT4B as well as a sequence common to OCT4A and OCT4B, and the two are essential for IRES activity. Like other cellular IRESs, the IRES activity of the minimal element shows significant variation in different cell lines. The minimal element is also functional under oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problems of designing a robust observer and developing a backstepping-based adaptive fuzzy control scheme for a class of strict-feedback systems, in which the virtual control coefficients are unknown. By using convex combination method, a robust fuzzy observer has been constructed to estimate the unmeasurable system state variables. Further, an observer-based adaptive fuzzy control scheme has been proposed. During the controller design procedure, fuzzy logic systems are used to model the unknown nonlinear functions, adaptive technique and backstepping are combined to construct the ideal virtual and the real laws. The proposed adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller guarantees that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin and all the signals in the adaptive closed-loop system are bounded. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach.",

According to the level of lower extremity arterial occlusion, a composite grafts which consisting of a combined proximal PTFE prosthesis grafts with autogenous vein grafts were used to establish the sequential vascular reconstruction for multilevel and multistage arterial occlusive disease.The mean follow-up period after operation was 17 months. The primary graft patency rates in this series was 67.3%, the secondary graft patency rate was 78.8%.The treatment of composite sequential bypass is a practical means for multilevel arterial occlusive disease suffering from femoral-infrapopliteal arteries, which effectively resolves the insufficiency supply of autogenous vessel grafts and the problem of bad patency rate for vascular reconstruction with prosthetic grafts alone in arterial occlusion suffering from infrapopliteal arteries.",

This study mainly focused on lymphocyte migration to the splenic white pulp via micro-channels in Chinese soft-shelled turtles, Pelodiscus sinensis. The results showed that the sheathed capillaries in the turtle spleen were high endothelial venule (HEV)-like vessels. These capillaries consist of micro-channels that facilitate lymphocyte migration to the splenic white pulp. The micro-channel is a dynamic structure comprising processes of endothelial cells, supporting cells, and ellipsoid-associated cells (EACs), which provides a microenvironment for lymphocyte migration. The pattern of lymphocyte migration in the micro-channel of the turtle spleen includes the following steps: (i) lymphocyte first adheres to the endothelium of the sheathed capillary, passes through the endothelial cells, and traverses through the basement membrane of the sheathed capillary; (ii) it then enters into the ellipsoid combined with supporting cells and EACs; and (iii) lymphocyte migrates from the ellipsoid to the periellipsoidal lymphatic sheath (PELS) via the micro-channel. This study provides morphological evidence for lymphocyte migration in the micro-channels of turtle spleens and also an insight into the mechanism of lymphocyte homing to the splenic white pulp of reptiles.",

Experimental results demonstrated that the presence of alumina could reduce the intensity of exothermic reactions, as well as prolonged the setting time. Also, a significant increase in compressive strength was observed during all hardening stages after the substitution of magnesia by alumina. However, the effectiveness of alumina was limited by its solubility. Successive addition of alumina caused a cumulative increase in water requirement as indicated by a gradual loss in workability. Furthermore, the addition of alumina led to a reduction in porosity, and left a finely porous structure. Finally, the hydration products were examined through the techniques of thermogravimetric (DTA-TG), Scanning Electronic Microscopic-Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDs) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). These experimental results provided detailed information to improve basic understanding of magnesium phosphate cement blended with alumina and the structures of hydration products.",

        "abstract": "A quality monitoring and adjustment method based on the integration of SPC and EPC was proposed to solve the problems of quality control caused by noise in manufacturing processes. The integrated model of SPC and EPC based on variation state was built. Under the integrated framework, the methods of exponentially weighted moving average based on Kalman filter and process adjustment based on manufacturing process state were put forward to monitor quality and adjust process variations. Quality offset compensation was achieved while monitoring quality by integrating SPC and EPC. At the stage of quality monitoring, the technology of Kalman filter was first adopted to smooth data and to reduce noise, and then control charts were built by the method of exponentially weighted moving average to monitor processes. Average run length was adopted to verify the performance of the proposed method. At the stage of process adjustment, the model of process adjustment was built for smoothed data, and the variation state estimated values were used to adjust process variation. An application sample was developed to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed quality monitoring and adjustment method.",

Methods Clinical surgical dissection of nasal dorsum was studied bilaterally on 10 embalmed cadaveric head specimens. Results Nasal dorsum involved in nasal bone,nasal process of maxilla,and nasal process of frontal bone. The suture line length of nasal bone was about (25.2±2.91)mm,and suture line length of nasomaxillary (29.2±2.51)mm. The thickness of nasal process of maxilla at the level of piriform aperture was about (1.86±0.22)mm,at the level of the infraorbital border (2.18±0.22)mm,and at the level of medial canthal ligaments (2.78±0.10)mm. The distance between nasomaxillary groove and nasolacrimal duct was (3.52±1.22)mm for superior part,(5.10± 1.48)mm for middle part and (5.62±1.26)mm for inferior part respectively. The distance from the midpoint of insertion of the anterior branch of the medial canthal ligament to the nasomaxilloric suture was (2.87±0.08) mm. Conclusions For osteotomies of broad nasal bone reduction,the lateral incision have to be made from the superior part of inferior nasal concha,along with nasomaxillary groove under the periosteum and leaving the nasal lateral vein,reach to nasal root for meeting with medial incision,which is about the 3.5mm near the medial inferior aspect of orbital margin.",

This problem is challenging due to the existence of unknown dead zones, time-varying delays and unavoidable state variables. By constructing fuzzy approximators and state observers, the difficulties from unknown nonlinearities and unavailable state variables are surmounted, respectively. Lyapunov–Krasovskii functions are introduced to deal with the time-varying delays. The adaptive controllers are designed by a backstepping method and adaptive technique so that the closed-loop systems remain stable and the target signals can be tracked within a small error as well. At last, two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

We have studied the effects of codon optimization on the expression of human BMP2 (hBMP2) in tobacco plants. Three modified hBMP2 genes were transformed into tobacco under the control of either cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter or double-CaMV35S promoter plus alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) enhancer. The fused beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene was used to facilitate the assay of protein expression. The results indicated that codon optimization could increase the protein expression level obviously under CaMV35S promoter. However, under relatively stronger initiation condition (double-CaMV35S promoter plus AMV enhancer), only the gene with the lowest degree of codon optimization could increase the protein expression level. Our findings suggest that the action of codon optimization may be influenced by the factors of promoter strength and A+T content in tobacco plants.",

        "abstract": "The optimal treatment for adrenal metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been established. This study analyzed the effects of radiation therapy (RT) for such metastases and identified clinical features and predictors of survival in these patients.We retrospectively investigated 55 patients with adrenal metastasis from HCC who had been treated with RT. Radiation doses to the adrenal lesions ranged from 26 to 60 Gy, while the intrahepatic lesions were treated by surgical resection, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), liver transplantation, and/or RT. RT was conducted to adrenal lesions after their intrahepatic lesions were controlled more than 2 months. The parameters studied included survival rates and tumor responses to RT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate survival rate and the Cox regression model was used to identify potential predictors of outcome.The patients treated by RT had adrenal metastasis on the right side (41), the left (6), or on both sides (8). In all 55 patients, the median survival duration was 13.6 months and there was 100% pain relief after completion of RT. Adverse effects were mild to moderate. Unfavorable pretreatment predictors determined by univariate analysis were associated with multiple intrahepatic foci, metastases to additional organs, high γ-glutamyltransferase and alpha-fetoprotein levels, liver function of Child-Pugh classification B and uncontrolled primary HCC. By multivariate analysis, unfavorable predictors were multiple intrahepatic foci, metastases to additional organs and uncontrolled primary HCC.Radiotherapy as treatment for adrenal metastases in HCC is a good palliative therapy that is associated with reasonable safety. It appears reasonable that such patients should be considered to be treated with radiotherapy. Multiple intrahepatic foci, metastases to additional organs and uncontrolled primary HCC were unfavorable predictors.",

Histology, mechanical strength and porosity experiments were performed to evaluate the properties of decellularized matrices. MSCs were isolated from bone marrow of dogs and expanded ex vivo. Decellularized matrices were seeded with MSCs and further cultured in a pulsatile bioreactor. Morphological features of the tissue engineered grafts were assayed by HE staining and scanning electron microscopy.After cell extraction, absence of cellular components and preservation of extracellular matrix were verified. Mechanical strength of decellularized matrices was slightly reduced compared with native arteries. Porosity of decellularized matrices was 94.9%. Decellularized matrices were successfully seeded with MSCs, which grew to a near-confluent monolayer under flow conditions and MSCs were highly elongated and oriented to the flow direction.Small-diameter vascular grafts can be constructed by seeding MSCs onto xenogenic decellularized arterial matrices and culturing in a pulsatile bioreactor.",

While standardizing data, membership degree was adopted to finish it. While caculating weight, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and the variation coefficient method were combined to calculate weight instead of the average weight method in the grey relational analysis.

        "abstract": "Persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in humans represents a major roadblock to elimination of tuber- culosis. We describe identification of a locus in M. tuberculosis, mel2, that displays similarity to bacterial bioluminescent loci and plays an important role during persistence in mice. We constructed a deletion of the mel2 locus and found that the mutant displays increased susceptibility to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Upon infection of mice by aerosol the mutant grows normally until the persistent stage, where it does not persist as well as wild type. Histopathological analyses show that infection with the mel2 mutant results in reduced pathology and both CFU and histopathology indicate that dissemination of the mel2 mutant to the spleen is delayed. These data along with growth in activated macrophages and infection of Phox/ and iNOS/ mice and bone marrow-derived macrophages suggest that the primary mechanism by which mel2 affects pathogen- esis is through its ability to confer resistance to ROS. These studies provide the first insight into the mechanism of action for this novel class of genes that are related to bioluminescence genes. The role of mel2 in resistance to ROS is important for persistence and dissemination of M. tuberculosis and suggests that homologues in other bacterial species are likely to play a role in pathogenesis. Despite extensive efforts to eradicate tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, worldwide and prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains, tuberculosis remains one of the most frequent causes of death in humans. Currently, one-third of the world's population is thought to be persistently infected with tuberculosis (6, 19, 20). A better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to persistence in humans is needed be- fore it will be possible to develop rational strategies to prevent establishment of latency and block reactivation from it. Al- though the mouse model, even when infected by the natural low-dose aerosol route, does not replicate all aspects of patho- genesis by tuberculosis, its cost-effectiveness and the presence of numerous reagents make it an important tool for examina- tion of the acute and persistent stages of infection (26, 50, 51).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   People with diseases such as stroke, spinal cord injury, and trauma usually have paretic ankle involvement because of the plantar flexor and dorsiflexor muscle weakness. Individuals with paretic ankle normally have the drop-foot gait, which has the complications of foot-slap after heel contact and toe-drag during the swing phase of a gait cycle. This could cause slow walking speed, short step-length, high metabolic cost, and high risk of tripping. Ankle-foot orthotic intervention is mostly prescribed to treat paretic ankle impairments. In addition, ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) have been developed to assist human walking, which can reduce the weareru0027s metabolic cost of walking. To date, three kinds of AFOs have been developed, including the passive AFOs, semi-active AFOs, and active AFOs. This paper provides a systematic review on these three types of AFOs, where the biomechanics of normal and pathological gaits of human, the design concepts of the AFOs, and motion data collection of the human-machine system in human trials are described. The limitations of the currently developed AFOs and future research and development directions of AFOs are discussed, which would provide useful information for researchers to develop suitable AFOs.",

For this study, the patients were assigned to two groups. In group 1 (107 patients), the TTM tensor would be removed during the surgery, whereas it would be retained in group 2 (105 patients). Pre- and postoperative air conduction and bone conduction thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were reported, and the air-bone gaps (ABGs) were measured.Mean postoperative ABG was 16.0 dB in group 1 and 17.0 dB in group 2 and the ABG closure was 11.9 ± 8.5 in group 1 and 11.8 ± 9.7 in group 2. Both were not statistically different (P = .2381 and P = .9625). Overall, 84.1% of patients in group 1 and 75.2% of patients in group 2 attained a postoperative ABG of 20 dB or less. Success rate in group 1 is slightly higher than group 2, but not significant (P = .1255).The section of the tensor tympani muscle tendon in canal wall-down tympanoplasty with ossiculoplasty had no statistically significant influence on sound transmission and can be a safe maneuver in middle ear surgery.4 Laryngoscope, 2015.",

Firstly, FHM modeling method is presented for uncertain nonlinear systems with time-varying delay. Secondly, the new delay-dependent sufficient condition for the existence of a state feedback fuzzy hyperbolic tangent controller is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. The robust FHM-based control law can guarantee that the closed-loop system is robustly asymptotically stable with a prescribed H\"~ index. As more information of the FHM and the size of time-delay are taken into account, the proposed conditions are new and less conservative. Finally, three illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of using FHM-based controllers.",

        "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main histological subtype of lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer death. It is unclear whether the improved survival seen at high-volume centers applies to the general population and, more importantly, whether the improvement in lung cancer survival was just a consequence of improved screening work. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry was used to identify 405,580 patients with NSCLC diagnosed from 1988 to 2008. The patients were divided into four groups according to the year of diagnosis. Trends of clinical characteristics were analyzed to reflect the progress of screening work. Five-year relative survivals in various subgroups were compared. The results indicated that proportion of aged, advanced, and non-surgical patients increased, whereas patients with lymph node metastasis and high histology grade decreased. Improvements in all stages of NSCLC patients were demonstrated, with relatively more significant gains for patients with localized and regional disease. After potentially curative surgical resection, remarkable improvements were observed in both cohorts with time (surgical: 52.00%-63.00%; non-surgical: 6.10%-13.50%). Specifically, patients who underwent pneumonectomy, lobectomy/bilobectomy, and partial/wedge/segmental resection all presented better survival rates. Our SEER analysis demonstrated improvements among patients in all stages of NSCLC that were deemed attributable to improved therapy and medical care for NSCLC rather than improved screening work.",

METHODS Twenty-two liver transplant patients received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with tacrolimus and steroids were enrolled. For investigating MPA pharmacokinetic profile, plasma MPA concentrations was monitored before MMF dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 h after MMF dosing during the early period after transplantation, and the IMPDH activity on mononuclear cells was measured before dosing and at 1, 2 h after dosing. RESULTS A high inter-individualvariability in IMPDH activity was observed. The values of IMPDH activity were inversely related to plasma MPA concentrations (P<0.05). IMPDH activity changed inversely with MPA concentration before dosing and 2 hours after dosing. The values of IMPDH activity at 1 h after dosing were significantly lower than the pre-dose values (P<0.05). CONCLUSION IMPDH activity was reduced significantly with MMF therapy in liver transplant recipients, which may be a surrogate pharmacodynamics marker of MPA-induced immunosuppression.",

        "abstract": "Based on the leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs), minimal residual disease (MRD) related to the outcome can be detected by multiparameter flow cytometry in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Although 0.1% was commonly used as a cutoff value, measurable MRD or MRD level below 0.1% has also been associated with prognostic significance, more sensitive thresholds (<0.1%) are required for improving AML prognosis prediction. In this study, 292 adult patients diagnosed with AML (non-M3) were enrolled, 36 kinds of LAIPs were identified and the baseline expression levels in normal or regenerating bone marrows of each kind of LAIP were established, which ranged from <2.00×10 to 5.71x10 . The baseline level of each LAIP was considered as the individual threshold for MRD assessment. MRD statuses stratified by 0.1% or individual threshold were termed as 0.1%-MRD or individual-MRD, respectively. The patients of individual-MRD showed significantly better survival compared with those of 0.1%-MRD /individual-MRD or 0.1%-MRD . Multivariate analysis showed that when timepoints of complete remission, post the first and second consolidation course were considered, only post-consolidation 2 individual-MRD status presented independent prognostic value. Notably, in patients of cytogenetic-molecular low- (LR) or intermediate-risk (IR), the individual-MRD status could identify the patients with significantly different outcome, while 0.1%-MRD status could not. Furthermore, among the patients of LR or IR group which received chemotherapy only, those with individual-MRD status presented favorable survival which was comparable with that of the patients accepted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). This approach is useful in the selection of an ASCT strategy for clinical practice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

To this end, the heavy quark-light diquark picture is employed. We find that all masses of the available Λ  Q  and Ξ  Q  states can be understood well. The assignments to these states do not appear to contradict the strong decay properties. Λ  c (2760)+ and Ξ  c (2980) are assigned to the first radial excitations with J  P  = 1/2+. Λ  c (2940)+ and Ξ  c (3123) might be the 2P states. The Λ  c (2880)+ and Ξ c(3080) are the good 1D candidates with J  P  = 5/2+. Λ  c (3055) is likely to be a 1D state with J  P =3/2+. Λ  b (5912)0 and Λ  b (5920)0 favor the 1P assignments with J  P  = 1/2− and 3/2−, respectively.

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) have crucial roles in various processes, including cancer development and progression. However, the functional roles of circRNAs in breast cancer remain to be elucidated. In this study, we identified a novel circRNA (named circBMPR2) whose expression was lower in breast cancer tissues with metastasis. Moreover, circBMPR2 expression was negatively associated with the motility of breast cancer cells and significantly downregulated in human breast cancer tissues. Functionally, we found that circBMPR2 knockdown effectively enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, circBMPR2 knockdown promoted tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer cells through inhibiting tamoxifen-induced apoptosis, whereas circBMPR2 overexpression led to decreased tamoxifen resistance. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that circBMPR2 could abundantly sponge miR-553 and that miR-553 overexpression could attenuate the inhibitory effects caused by circBMPR2 overexpression. We also found that ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4) was a direct target of miR-553, which functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Our findings demonstrated that circBMPR2 might function as a miR-553 sponge and then relieve the suppression of USP4 to inhibit the progression and tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer. Targeting this newly identified circRNA may help us to develop potential novel therapies for breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia resulting from four cervical arterial occlusions due to Takayasu's arteritis is a rare condition. Ascending aortounilateral/-bilateral internal carotid arterial bypass is a means for relieving it. However, postoperative reperfusion syndrome remains an unsolved severe, even fatal complication. The following case report reveals new findings. The patient presented massive cerebral infarction in the left cerebral hemisphere, four cervical arterial lesions, and bilateral subclavian steal syndrome. An ascending aorta to bilateral axillary bypass resumed the vertebral blood flow, and as a result the patient had a marvelous improvement. Unlike ascending aorta-carotid bypass, which directly increases brain perfusion, our procedure does so indirectly via axillary arteries. Therefore, there is strong reason to recommend ascending aorta to biaxillary bypass for patients with cerebral ischemia due to four cervical arterial lesions accompanying a bilateral subclavian steal phenomenon that has reversed vertebral flow.",

The effects of silica fume and polypropylene(PP) fiber on the compressive and splitting tensile strength, and drying shrinkage of foamed concrete with density of 800-1500 kg/m3 were investigated. The results indicate that foamed concrete with density of 800-1500 kg/m3 and compressive strength of 10-50 MPa can be made by using silica fume and PP fiber. Silica fume and PP fiber greatly improve the compressive strength of foamed concrete, and the higher the use level of foam, the higher the compressive strength.

        "abstract": "Induction of effective antibody responses against HIV-1 infection remains an elusive goal for vaccine development. Progress may require in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of neutralization by monoclonal antibodies. We have analyzed the molecular actions of two rare, broadly neutralizing, human monoclonal antibodies, 4E10 and 2F5, which target the transiently exposed epitopes in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41 envelope during viral entry. Both have long CDR H3 loops with a hydrophobic surface facing away from the peptide epitope. We find that the hydrophobic residues of 4E10 mediate a reversible attachment to the viral membrane and that they are essential for neutralization, but not for interaction with gp41. We propose that these antibodies associate with the viral membrane in a required first step and are thereby poised to capture the transient gp41 fusion intermediate. These results bear directly on strategies for rational design of HIV-1 envelope immunogens.",

        "abstract": "Tamoxifen is the most commonly used endocrine therapy for patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. Despite its initial therapeutic efficacy, many patients eventually develop drug resistance, which remains a serious clinical challenge. To investigate roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in tamoxifen resistance, a tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell line was established and screened for its circRNA expression profile by RNA sequencing. hsa_circ_0025202, a circRNA that was significantly downregulated, was selected for further investigation. Using a large cohort of clinical specimens, we found that hsa_circ_0025202 exhibited low expression in cancer tissues and was negatively correlated with lymphatic metastasis and histological grade. Gain- and loss-of-function assays indicated that hsa_circ_0025202 could inhibit cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration and increase cell apoptosis and sensitivity to tamoxifen. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays verified that hsa_circ_0025202 could act as a miRNA sponge for miR-182-5p and further regulate the expression and activity of FOXO3a. Functional studies revealed that tumor inhibition and tamoxifen sensitization effects of hsa_circ_0025202 were achieved via the miR-182-5p/FOXO3a axis. Moreover, in vivo experiments confirmed that hsa_circ_0025202 could suppress tumor growth and enhance tamoxifen efficacy. Taken together, hsa_circ_0025202 served an anti-oncogenic role in HR-positive breast cancer, and it could be exploited as a novel marker for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Homoharringtonine (HHT), a known protein synthesis inhibitor, has an anti-myeloid leukemia effect and potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of anthracycline/cytarabine induction regimens for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with favorable and intermediate prognoses, especially in the t(8;21) subtype. Here we provide evidence showing that HHT inhibits the activity of leukemia-initiating cells (Lin/Sca-1/c-kit; LICs) in a t(8;21) murine leukemia model and exerts a down-regulating effect on MYC pathway genes in human t(8;21) leukemia cells (Kasumi-1). We discovered that NF-κB repressing factor (NKRF) is bound directly by HHT via the second double-strand RNA-binding motif (DSRM2) domain, which is the nuclear localization signal of NKRF. A series of deletion and mutagenesis experiments mapped HHT direct binding sites to K479 and C480 amino acids in the DSRM2 domain. HHT treatment shifts NKRF from the nucleus (including nucleoli) to the cytoplasm by occupying the DSRM2 domain, strengthens the p65-NKRF interaction, and interferes with p65-p50 complex formation, thereby attenuating the transactivation activity of p65 on the  gene. Moreover, HHT significantly decreases the expression of , a frequently mutated and/or highly expressed gene in t(8;21) AML, in concert with MYC down-regulation. Our work thus identifies a mechanism of action of HHT that is different from, but acts in concert with, the known mode of action of this compound. These results justify further clinical testing of HHT in AML.",

A new adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed for nonlinear delayed systems with unknown dead-zone nonlinearity. Control design is achieved by introducing a variable separation approach and employing the unique structural property of fuzzy logic systems. The proposed adaptive fuzzy controller guarantees that all the closed-loop signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. Two simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel control scheme is proposed for the tracking problem of mechanical systems in the presence of external vibrations and friction. An acclerometer is installed on the load frame in the mechanical systems to detect the external vibrations. Then a neural network (NN) compensator with accelerometer signal as its input is adopted for feedforward compensation of external vibrations. Another NN is employed to compensate for the unknown system dynamics thereby compensate for friction. To eliminate the residual reconstruction error coming from NN approximation, the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback term is integrated into the control scheme. A Lyapunov stability analysis is performed to show that the proposed control scheme can be used to yield a semi-global asymptotic tracking result rather than uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) results derived by typical NN-based controllers. In particular, exact models of the plant, external disturbances and the accelerometer are not needed. A comparative study on system performance is conducted on a two-link robot manipulator between the proposed control scheme and the main conventional control methods for showing satisfactory tracking performance of the proposed control scheme.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of pazufloxacin mesilate in Chinese healthy volunteers. METHODS: 9 healthy volunteers were divided into 3 groups randomly. Each one was given 150, 300 and 500 mg of pazufloxacin mesilate in a given order, respectively. A HPLC method was established for the determination of plasma pazufloxacin mesilate concentration. 3P87 software was used for the analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters. SPSS11.0 and SAS6.12 software were used for statistic analysis. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of pazufloxacin mesilate was discribed by a two-compartment open model. Pharmacokinetic parameters for three different dosages were as follows: t 1/2β (1.90 ± 0.47), (1.71 ± 0.48) and (1.60 ± 0.26) h; ρ max (3.22 ± 1.20), (6.62 ± 2.39) and (11.07 ± 3.86) mg·L -1; AUC 0-2 h (4.93 ± 1.23), (11.36 ± 2.10) and (18.13 ± 4.50) mg·h·L -1; AUC 0-∞ (5.01 ± 1.22), (11.56 ± 2.13) and (18.28 ± 4.52) mg·h·L -1; CL, (33.20 ± 7.48), (28.23 ± 4.67) and (30.74 ± 9.61) L·h -1; V d (17.83 ± 9.44),(24.66 ± 14.63) and (20.10 ± 14.24) L; MRT 0-12 h (2.03 ± 0.35), (2.11 ± 0.20) and (2.10 ± 0.27) h; MRT 0-x (2.28 ± 0.43), (2.35 ± 0.38) and (2.21 ± 0.32) h, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between male and female volunteers. Except ρ max, AUC 0-12 h and AUC 0-∞, no statistically significant difference was obtained among different dosages. There were linear correlation between ρ max, AUC 0-12 h, AUC 0-∞ and dosage. CONCLUSION: Pazufloxacin mesilate is characterized by linear pharmacokinetics, it can be safely used for the control of infection.",

In this study, melodic contour identification was measured in cochlear implant (CI) and normal-hearing (NH) listeners, with and without a competing masker; timing, pitch, and timbre cues were varied between the masker and target contour. NH performance was near-perfect across different conditions. CI performance was significantly poorer than that of NH listeners. While some CI subjects were able to use or combine timing, pitch and/or timbre cues, most were not, reflecting poor segregation due to poor spectral resolution.",

        "abstract": "AIM: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from canine are generally considered to be useful for fabricating tissue engineering, thus this paper examines their capacity to differentiate into smooth muscle-like cells (SMLCs) in vitro. METHODS: The experiment was conducted at the First-Degree Laboratory, the State Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education, the Surgery Laboratory of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University from October 2005 to December 2006. Materials: Six female mongrel dogs (20-30 kg) were obtained from the Key Laboratory Animal Cultivate Center of Beijing [The number of the license is SCXK(Beijing)2000-0015], animals were at the first degree of breeding. Methods: ①Isolation and culture of BMMCs: Bone marrow (10 mL for each dog) was aspirated from the anterior superior iliac spine and immediately mixed with heparin and equal volume of phosphate buffered solution (PBS). Then 20 mL mixture was centrifuged at 4 ℃ on a same volume of lymphocyte separation medium for 10 minutes at 1500 rpm. BMMCs on the layer between plasma and centrifugate, separated by a gradient centrifugator, were washed three times with PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).②Differentiation of BMMCs into SMLCs: Dog BMMCs were cultured and induced in DMEM/F12 containing 15% FBS, and epidermal growth factor (0.5 μg/L), basic fibroblast growth factor (2 μg/L), platelet derived growth factor BB (10 μg/L), insulin-like growth factor (100 μg/L), ascorbic acid (1 mmol/L) and praline (0.04 mmol/L) in culture flask coated with collagen. Cells were seeded at a density of 1×109 L-1 and maintained at 37 ℃ in a humidified atmosphere (50 ml/L CO2). The morphologic characteristics of the cells were observed under an inverted phase contrast microscope. The growth of the induced cells was recorded on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th days of culture. Cell phenotypes were identified by immunohistochemical staining, while the cell growth and proliferation were also evaluated. RESULTS: ①The numbers of SMLCs that differentiated from BMMCs per well of the culture plate on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th days of culture were (2.73±0.18)×108, (3.17±0.36)×108, (7.35±1.28)×108, (23.61±1.56)×108, (53.48±3.47)×108, (48.51±5.36)×108 L-1, respectively.②Some of the primary cells were positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin and negative for calponine and myosin heavy chain. A large proportion (60.5±5.9)% of the cells were obviously positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin but the myofilament structure was ambiguous; P3 cells grew to confluence 5 days later, and most of the induced cells were positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin, calponine and myosin heavy chain, accounting for (86.2±13.5)%, (78.7±10.2)%, (76.63±13.8)%, separately. A myofilament structure was clearly evident in the cytoplasm of these P3 cells. The number of positive cells in this population were obviously much more than among the primary cells (P < 0.05).③Most of the primary SMLCs expressed Flk-1, but the P3 cells were almost negative. The cell membrane and cytoplasm of the positive cells were stained brown. The primary and passaged cells were both positive for Vimentin and negative for Desmin. The cytoplasma of the Vimentin positive cells were stained brown. CONCLUSION: BMMCs can be oriented to differentiate into SMLCs in vitro. Canine BMMCs may be a useful source of SMLCs for tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Animal and human highlanders have evolved distinct traits to enhance tissue oxygen delivery and utilization. Unlike vertebrates, insects use their tracheal system for efficient oxygen delivery. However, the genetic basis of insect adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia remains unexplored. Here, we report a potential mechanism of metabolic adaptation of migratory locusts in the Tibetan Plateau, through whole-genome resequencing and functional investigation. A genome-wide scan revealed that the positively selected genes in Tibetan locusts are predominantly involved in carbon and energy metabolism. We observed a notable signal of natural selection in the gene PTPN1, which encodes PTP1B, an inhibitor of insulin signaling pathway. We show that a PTPN1 coding mutation regulates the metabolism of Tibetan locusts by mediating insulin signaling activity in response to hypoxia. Overall, our findings provide evidence for the high-altitude hypoxia adaptation of insects at the genomic level and explore a potential regulatory mechanism underlying the evolved metabolic homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of delay-range-dependent L 2–L ∞ filter design for stochastic systems with time-varying delay. The time delay varies in an interval. A delay-range-dependent sufficient condition is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which guarantees the existence of a linear filter. The proposed filter ensures that the filtering error system is stochastically asymptotically stable and that its L 2–L ∞ performance satisfies a prescribed level. The corresponding filter design is cast into a convex optimization problem which can be efficiently handled by using standard numerical algorithms. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

To explore the involvement of EEN in leukemogenesis caused by MLL-EEN, we studied the transformation potential of the MLL-EEN fusion protein. MLL-EEN had oncogenic features, while, as a control, MLLDelta, the truncated form of MLL lacking the EEN moiety, did not show any oncogenic potential. MLL-EEN exerted a dominant-negative effect over wild-type EEN in terms of subcellular localization. Normally, EEN was found in the cytoplasm, but the MLL-EEN fusion protein was located in the nucleus, and EEN could be delocalized by MLL-EEN. This interaction is via a coiled-coil dimerization domain of EEN, which is reserved in the fusion protein. In addition, MLL-EEN might act as a potential transcriptional factor with the MLL part providing the DNA-binding domain and the EEN part providing the transcription activation domain, though EEN seems to have no direct role in transcriptional regulation. As an aberrant transcriptional factor, MLL-EEN could transactivate the promoter of HoxA7, a potential target gene of MLL.",

        "abstract": "The front-line antituberculosis drug isoniazid (INH) and the related drug ethionamide (ETH) are prodrugs that upon activation inhibit the synthesis of mycolic acids, leading to bactericidal activity. Coresistance to INH and ETH can be mediated by dominant mutations in the target gene inhA, encoding an enoyl-ACP reductase, or by recessive mutations in ndh, encoding a type II NADH dehydrogenase (NdhII). To address the mechanism of resistance mediated by the latter, we have isolated novel ndh mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The M. smegmatis ndh mutants were highly resistant to INH and ETH, while the M. bovis BCG mutants had low-level resistance to INH and ETH. All mutants had defects in NdhII activity resulting in an increase in intracellular NADH/NAD(+) ratios. Increasing NADH levels were shown to protect InhA against inhibition by the INH-NAD adduct formed upon INH activation. We conclude that ndh mutations mediate a novel mechanism of resistance by increasing the NADH cellular concentration, which competitively inhibits the binding of INH-NAD or ETH-NAD adduct to InhA.",

Based on the Razumikhin function approach, a novel adaptive fuzzy controller is designed. The proposed controller guarantees that the system output converges to a small neighborhood of the reference signal and all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded. Different from the existing adaptive fuzzy control methodology, the fuzzy logic systems are used to model the desired but unknown control signals rather than the unknown nonlinear functions in the systems. As a result, the proposed adaptive controller has a simpler form and requires fewer adaptation parameters.",

It has been demonstrated in our previous work that native human BDNF fused with a collagen-binding domain (CBD-BDNF) can bind to collagen specifically to exert the neurotrophic effect on promoting axonal regeneration. After injury, collagen is highly accumulated at the injury site. We thus speculate that CBD-BDNF will bind to the extracellular matrix collagen and concentrate at the injury site to improve the therapy. Using the rat spinal cord crushed injury model, we have found that CBD-BDNF by one-time intrathecally injection could be retained and concentrated at the injury site for a longer time than native BDNF without collagen-binding domain. CBD-BDNF could promote better neural regeneration and locomotion recovery.",

        "abstract": "Nonribosomal peptide synthases produce short peptides in a manner that is distinct from classical mRNA-dependent ribosome-mediated translation. The  genome harbors a nonribosomal peptide synthase gene, , which is part of a gene cluster proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of isonitrile lipopeptides. Orthologous clusters are found in other slow-growing pathogenic mycobacteria and actinomycetes. To probe the role of the  gene in infection, we generated an  deletion mutant in  H37Rv and tested its virulence in immunocompetent (C57BL/6) mice. The  mutant strain displayed lower initial growth rates in the lungs and a defective dissemination to the spleens of infected mice. Mice infected with the mutant strain also survived for twice as long as those infected with wild-type  and, remarkably, showed subdued pathology, despite similar bacterial loads at later stages of infection. The differences in the course of infection between wild-type and  mutant strains were accompanied by distinct dynamics of the immune response. Most strikingly, the  mutant was highly attenuated in immunodeficient (SCID-, recombination activating 2 [RAG2]-, and gamma interferon [IFN-γ]-deficient) mice, suggesting that macrophages control the  mutant more efficiently than they control the wild-type strain. However, in the presence of IFN-γ, both strains were equally controlled. We propose that the  gene and its associated cluster are drivers of virulence during the early stages of infection. Over 10 million people developed tuberculosis (TB) in 2016, and over 1.8 million individuals succumbed to the disease. These numbers make TB the ninth leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause from a single infectious agent. Therefore, finding novel therapeutic targets in , the pathogen that causes most cases of human TB, is critical. In this study, we reveal a novel virulence factor in , the  gene. The lack of  highly attenuates the course of  infection in the mouse model, which is particularly relevant in immune-deficient hosts. This is very relevant as TB is particularly incident in immune-suppressed individuals, such as HIV patients.",

        "abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope spike [trimeric (gp160)3, cleaved to (gp120/gp41)3] is the mediator of viral entry and the principal target of humoral immune response to the virus. Production of a recombinant preparation that represents the functional spike poses a challenge for vaccine development, because the (gp120/gp41)3 complex is prone to dissociation. We have reported previously that stable HIV-1 gp140 trimers, the uncleaved ectodomains of (gp160)3, have nearly all of the antigenic properties expected for native viral spikes. Because of recent claims that uncleaved gp140 proteins may adopt a nonnative structure with three gp120 moieties &amp;quot;dangling&amp;quot; from a trimeric gp41 ectodomain in its postfusion conformation, we have inserted a long, flexible linker between gp120 and gp41 in our stable gp140 trimers to assess their stability and to analyze their conformation in solution. The modified trimer has biochemical and antigenic properties virtually identical to those of its unmodified counterpart. Both forms bind a single CD4 per trimer, suggesting that the trimeric conformation occludes two of the three CD4 sites even when a flexible linker has relieved the covalent constraint between gp120 and gp41. In contrast, an artificial trimer containing three gp120s flexibly tethered to a trimerization tag binds three CD4s and has antigenicity nearly identical to that of monomeric gp120. Moreover, the gp41 part of both modified and unmodified gp140 trimers has a structure very different from that of postfusion gp41. These results show that uncleaved gp140 trimers from suitable isolates have compact, native-like structures and support their use as candidate vaccine immunogens.",

Less restrictive assumption for unknown nonlinear functions is provided. Via the recursive approach, a state feedback controller is designed by guaranteeing the fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system without external disturbances and a prescribed degree for the influence of the external disturbances on the output, in which the upper bound of the settling time only depends the control design parameters. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed design method.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of HIV and the widespread emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, newer control strategies in the form of a better vaccine could decrease the global incidence of tuberculosis. A desirable trait in an effective live attenuated vaccine strain is an ability to persist within the host in a limited fashion in order to produce important protective antigens in vivo1, 2. Attenuated M. tuberculosis vaccine candidates have been constructed by deleting genes required for growth in mice3, 4, 5. These candidate vaccines did not elicit adequate protective immunity in animal models, due to their inability to persist sufficiently long within the host tissues. Here we report that an auxotrophic mutant of M. tuberculosis defective in the de novo biosynthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is highly attenuated in immunocompromised SCID mice and in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. SCID mice infected with the pantothenate auxotroph survived significantly longer (250 days) than mice infected with either bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine or virulent M. tuberculosis (77 and 35 days, respectively). Subcutaneous immunization with this auxotroph conferred protection in C57BL/6J mice against an aerosol challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis, which was comparable with that afforded by BCG vaccination. Our findings highlight the importance of de novo pantothenate biosynthesis in limiting the intracellular survival and pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis without reducing its immunogenicity in vaccinated mice.",

The performance metrics that were evaluated include the write/read margin, access latency, energy consumption per programming, and the density per bit. Different 3D cross-point architecture including the horizontally stacked or the vertically stacked structure were compared in terms of these metrics, revealing the advantages of the vertical RRAM structure. Then the scaling trend of the vertical RRAM based 3D array with respect to the scaling of lateral feature size, vertical electrode thickness and vertical isolation layer thickness were evaluated. The design parameters that affect the scaling trend include the metal interconnect resistance, RRAM on-state cell resistance (or the nonlinearity of the I-V). The design trade-offs are discussed considering those parameters constraints.",

This paper provides a systematic literature review that is focused on the fundamental information of MPC and the key findings of the physio-mechanical behaviors on various application of MPC products of the evidence of  123  publications published over a period of 38 years from 1980 to 2018. More importantly, this study primarily concentrates on the information collection of the production and utilization of MPC in bio-materials, crack repair in pavements, hazardous waste management, fibre reinforced mortar, particle boards and clinical bio-ceramics using different design mixes of the MPC ingredients by the previous scholars. Additionally, based on the globally published data, the appropriate strength results of the MPC matrices under different material combinations have also discussed here. Even, it identifies various potential and challenging aspects related to the applicability of new dimensional MPC materials. As a final point, this review may encourage the readers to open the new chapter on further application sectors of MPC as a greater scale in the civil engineering aspects, preparing the usable products of daily life for human being and biomedical engineering usages.",

The results showed that the effects of different fibers on expansion of cement paste are related to the properties of fibers. Carbon fiber and alkali-resistant glass fiber, which have high elastic modulus, can effectively restrain the expansion, while nylon fiber with low elastic modulus has no restraint effect on the expansion.

        "abstract": "Maladaptive cardiac metabolism is a common trigger of cardiac lipid accumulation and cardiac injury under serious burn challenge. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is the key enzyme that catalyzes triglyceride hydrolysis; however, its alteration and impact on cardiac function following serious burn injury are still unknown. Here, we found that the cardiac fatty acid (FA) metabolism increased, accompanied by augmented FA accumulation and ATGL expression, after serious burn injury. We generated heterozygous ATGL knockout and heterozygous cardiac-specific ATGL overexpression thermal burn mice. The results demonstrated that partial loss of ATGL could not relieve burn-induced cardiac lipid accumulation and cardiac injury, possibly due to the suppression of cardiac FA metabolism plus insufficient compensatory glucose utilization. In contrast, cardiac-specific overexpression of ATGL alleviated cardiac lipid accumulation and cardiac injury following burn challenge by switching the substrate preference from FA towards increased glucose utilization. The underlying mechanism was possibly related to increased glucose transporter-1 expression and reduced cardiac lipid accumulation induced by ATGL overexpression. Our data first demonstrated that elevated cardiac ATGL expression after serious burn injury is an adaptive, albeit insufficient, response to compensate for the increase in energy consumption and that further overexpression of ATGL is beneficial for ameliorating cardiac injury, indicating its therapeutic potential.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) prepared with dead burned magnesia oxide (MgO), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH 2 PO 4 , KDP) and some retarders at a given proportion was applied as repairing material. In this research, the mechanical properties and durability of MPC modified by a silane-based redispersible polymer powder (RPP) were investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that the compressive and flexural strength at different curing ages increased as increasing RPP content initial, and decreased as the content going beyond 0.35%. The addition of RPP significantly improved the bonding strength between MPC mortar and substrate OPC concrete, and the flexural and tensile bonding strength of MPC with 0.233% RPP at 1 day of curing were 4.6 MPa and 1.65 MPa, respectively. The addition of RPP can improve the pore structure and transfer the hydrophilic surface of some minerals to hydrophobic one, hence improving the water resistance of MPC. For MPC mortar with RPP after freeze-thaw cycles, the mass loss and the freeze-thaw influence coefficient were both smaller due to less water permeating into hardened MPC mortar. Due to more harmless pores in MPC mortar with RPP, the volume stability was improved. The XRD analysis illustrates that small amount of RPP has little impact on the hydration reaction of MPC. The SEM micrographs confirms that the pore structure of set MPC could be improved by adding an appropriate content of RPP.",

Such class of systems may not be stabilized by delay-free dynamic compensators, while delayed dynamic compensator could achieve such purpose. We provide a design scheme of time-delayed dynamic compensator which makes the closed-loop system admissible. The design involves solving a quadratic matrix inequality, and consequently, we build a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based algorithm to compute compensator gains. We verify that, under certain circumstances for which delay-free dynamic compensators fail to stabilize, the proposed method works well. An illustrative example demonstrates the usefulness of the present scheme.",

        "abstract": "Studies have shown that endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) activated by spinal cord injury (SCI) primarily generate astrocytes to form glial scar. The NSCs do not differentiate into neurons because of the adverse microenvironment. In this study, we defined the activation timeline of endogenous NSCs in rats with severe SCI. These injury-activated NSCs then migrated into the lesion site. Cetuximab, an EGFR signaling antagonist, significantly increased neurogenesis in the lesion site. Meanwhile, implanting cetuximab modified linear ordered collagen scaffolds (LOCS) into SCI lesion sites in dogs resulted in neuronal regeneration, including neuronal differentiation, maturation, myelination, and synapse formation. The neuronal regeneration eventually led to a significant locomotion recovery. Furthermore, LOCS implantation could also greatly decrease chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) deposition at the lesion site. These findings suggest that endogenous neurogenesis following acute complete SCI is achievable in species ranging from rodents to large animals via functional scaffold implantation. LOCS-based Cetuximab delivery system has a promising therapeutic effect on activating endogenous neurogenesis, reducing CSPGs deposition and improving motor function recovery.",

In this report, we found that the native human NGF-beta fused with a collagen-binding domain (CBD) could form a collagen-based NGF targeting delivery system, and the CBD-fused NGF-beta could bind to collagen membranes efficiently. Using the rabbit dermal ischemic ulcer model, we have found that this targeting delivery system maintains a higher concentration and stronger bioactivity of NGF-beta on the collagen membranes by promoting peripheral nerve growth. Furthermore, it enhances the rate of ulcer healing through accelerating the re-epithelialization of dermal ulcer wounds and the formation of capillary lumens within the newly formed tissue area. Thus, collagen membranes loaded with collagen-targeting human NGF-beta accelerate ulcer healing efficiently.",

However, there are numbers of limitations for in vitro cell proliferation. Nanog is an important self-renewal determinant in embryonic stem cells. However, it remains unknown whether Nanog will influence the cell cycle and cell proliferation of mature cells. In this study, we expressed Nanog in NIH3T3 cells and showed that expression of Nanog in NIH3T3 promoted cells to enter into S phase and enhanced cell proliferation. This suggests that Nanog gene might function in a similar fashion in mature cells as in ES cells. In addition, it may provide an approach for in vitro cell expansion.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To assess the efficacy and safety of homemade lipoprostagladin E1 injection in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Methods:A randomized,controlled study was conducted by Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University. From September 2006 to September 2007,207 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups:the homemade lipoprostagladin E1 group (101 cases) and the non-homemade lipoprostagladin E1 group (106 cases ). The homemade lipoprostagladin E1 group comprised 72 males and 29 females with an average age of (63.8±9.3) years. The non-homemade lipoprostagladin E1 group comprised 67 males and 39 females with an average age of (63.7±8.4) years. The patients in both groups were administered an IV infusion of the homemade lipoprostagladin E1 10 μg and non-homemade lipoprostagladin E1 10 μg via Murphy's dropper once daily for 2 weeks,respectively. Rest pain score,ankle-brachial index,maximal painless walking distance,and the area of ischemic ulceration were recorded before treatment and on the day of treatment end ,and adverse reactions were observed during treatment. Results:In the homemade lipoprostagladin E1 and non-homemade lipoprostagladin E1 groups,the rest pain scores were (1.30±1.54) and (1.52±1.74) after 2 weeks of treatment as well as (2.37±2.17) and (2.38±2.29) before treatment; the differences were statistically significant (P<0.01,P<0.001),but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups(P>0.05); the ankle-brachial indexes were (0.76±0.22) and (0.74±0.22) after treatment as well as (0.68±0.20) and (0.66±0.21) before treatment,respectively; the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05,P< 0.01),but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P> 0.05). The improvement rate of the walking distance of patients with claudication was 10.34% and 16.13% before and after treatment,respectively; there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups(P>0.05). The difference in the area of ischemic ulceration was not statistically significant before and after treatment (P>0.05). In the homemade lipoprostagladin E1 group,9 patients developed adverse reactions including elevated liver aminotransferase (3 cases),phlebitis (3 cases),dermatitis (1 case),abnormal WBC count (1 case),elevated INR (1 case); the incidence was 8.9%. In the non-homemade lipoprostagladin E1,8 patients developed adverse reactions including phlebitis (2 cases),dermatitis (1 case),gastrointestinal uncomfort (1 case),palpitation (1 case),chest distress (1 case),abnormal WBC count (1 case),and fatigue (1 case); the incidence was 7.5%. The difference in the incidence of adverse reactions was not statistically significant between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion:The homemade lipoprostagladin E1 injection is a safe and effective agent for treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.",

The aim of the present study was to develop a collagen-based targeting bone repair system. A collagen-binding domain (CBD) was added to the N-terminal of native BMP-2 to allow it bind to collagen specifically. We showed that the collagen-binding bone morphogenetic protein-2 (named bone morphogenetic protein2-h, BMP2-h) had maintained the full biological activity as compared to rhBMP2 lacking the CBD. In vitro functional study also demonstrated that collagen matrix could maintain higher bioactivity of BMP2-h than native BMP-2. When demineralized bone matrix (DBM) impregnated with BMP2-h was implanted subcutaneously in rats, homogeneous bone formation was observed. Moreover, in a rabbit mandible defect model, surgical implantation of collagen matrix loaded with BMP2-h exhibited remarkable osteoinductive properties and excellent homogeneous bone formation. Our studies suggested that this novel collagen-based BMP-2 targeting bone repair system induced better bone formation not only in quantity but also in quality. Similar approaches may also be used for the repair of other tissue injuries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As an environmentally-friendly construction technique, modern rammed earth generally stabilized with ordinary Portland cement has attracted growing interest recently. In this study, cement-based composite (CSCN) consisting of cement, sodium silicate and composite promoter is employed to substitute ordinary Portland cement, and self-compacting earth-based specimens without compacting energy are prepared. The variables controlling strength development are investigated by unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and physical property tests. The total cement content ( C ) is proposed based on the pozzolanic effects of the supplementary cementing materials in CSCN, and the relationships of pozzolanic factors to curing time are also analyzed. The ratio of the porosity to total cement content ( n t  / C ) combines together the variables  C , curing time and fundamental parameters of stabilized earth, and the relational expression between strength and  n t  / C  is put forward. To normalize the fundamental parameters, the multiple linear regression is employed to analyze the after-curing unit weight (γ  t  ) and total water content ( w t  ), and the power regression is used to analyze the after-curing specific gravity ( G st  ). Subsequently, the phenomenological models for strength development of CSCN stabilized earth are established. A series of specimens are used to evaluate the precision of the phenomenological models, and the comparison of predicted strength and actual strength implies that the deviation is generally within 10%.",

        "abstract": "We report follow-up XMM-Newton and ground-based optical observations of the\nunusual X-ray binary SDSS J102347.67+003841.2 (=FIRST J102347.6+003841), and a\nnew candidate intermediate polar found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: SDSS\nJ093249.57+472523.0. SDSS J1023 was observed in its low-state, with similar\nmagnitude/color (V=17.4 and B=17.9), and smooth orbital modulation as seen in\nmost previous observations. We further refine the ephemeris (for photometric\nminimum) to: HJD(TT)_min= 2453081.8546(3) + E* 0.198094(1) d. It is easily\ndetected in X-rays at an unabsorbed flux (0.01-10.0 keV) of 5x10e-13\nerg/cm^2/s. Fitting a variety of models we find that: (i) either a hot (kT>~15\nkeV) optically thin plasma emission model (bremsstrahlung or MEKAL) or a simple\npower law can provide adequate fits to the data; (ii) these models prefer a low\ncolumn density ~10e19 cm^-2; (iii) a neutron star atmosphere plus power law\nmodel (as found for quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries) can also produce a good\nfit (for plausible distances), though only for a much higher column of about\n4x10e20 cm^-2 and a very cool atmosphere kT<~50eV. These results support the\ncase that SDSS J1023 is a transient LMXB, and indeed places it in the subclass\nof such systems whose quiescent X-ray emission is dominated by a hard power law\ncomponent. Our optical photometry of SDSS J0932 reveals that it is an high\ninclination eclipsing system. Combined with its optical characteristics -- high\nexcitation emission lines, and brightness, yielding a large F_X/F_opt ratio --\nits highly absorbed X-ray spectrum argues that SDSS J0932 is a strong IP\ncandidate. However, only more extensive optical photometry and a detection of\nits spin or spin-orbit beat frequency can confirm this classification.\n(abridged)",

C(0) and C(2) were collected for 5 months in 146 patients. The CYP3A5*3 genotype and MDR1 haplotype were determined by methods based on amplification refractory mutant PCR. The data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed-effect modeling (NONMEM). The model was evaluated using goodness of fit plots and relative error measurements. Physiological and pathological factors including CYP3A5 and MDR1 genotypes were evaluated as covariates of CsA pharmacokinetic parameters.Pharmacokinetics of CsA was best described by a one-compartment disposition model followed a first-order absorption process. The estimated clearance (CL/F) was 49.5 l·h(-1), the volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 226 l. K(a) was fixed as 1.25 h(-1). Post-transplant data, body weight, total bilirubin, and MDR1 genotype were covariates of CL/F (P < 0.005). Gender and MDR1 haplotype were covariates of Vd/F (P < 0.005). The AUC estimated based on the Bayesian method was 7,465 ± 1,708 ng·h·ml(-1) (2,946 ∼13,926 ng·h·ml(-1)).The PPK model developed in this study could be used to optimize CsA dose for Chinese renal transplant recipients by using conventional therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data.",

        "abstract": "Targeted therapy is a new generation of therapeutics, where two critical factors are involved. One is the particular molecular target, and the other is the specific target-binding drug. In this work, the fibrin, a main component of plasma clot at wound sites, was used as the target for human bFGF, aiming to improve therapeutic neovascularization and wound repair. To endow bFGF with fibrin-targeting ability, a fibrin-binding peptide Kringle1 (K1), derived from human plasminogen, was fused to human bFGF. The recombinant K1bFGF showed high fibrin and plasma-clot-binding ability. When applied to the wound sites with plasma clots, K1bFGF induced robust neovascularization and improved wound healing. To extend the application of K1bFGF to other cases where no plasma clots exist, we developed a fibrin-scaffold/K1bFGF system. This system could induce localized neovascularization by delivery of K1bFGF in a sustained and site-targeting manner, and provide a microenvironment promoting cell growth and tissue regeneration. In summary, we successfully used the pathologic environment fibrin clot as the target for bFGF, and based on which bFGF was designed into a targeting agent by introduction of a fibrin-binding peptide. This provides a potential approach to improve therapeutic neovascularization and wound repair.",

Based on a neural network (NN) online approximation model, a novel adaptive neural controller is obtained by constructing a novel quadratic-type Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, which not only efficiently avoids the controller singularity, but also relaxes the restriction on unknown virtual control coefficients. The merit of the suggested controller design scheme is that the number of online adapted parameters is independent of the number of nodes of the neural networks, which reduces the number of the online adaptive learning laws considerably. The proposed controller guarantees that all closed-loop signals remain bounded, while the output tracking error dynamics converges to a neighborhood of the origin. A simulation example is given to illustrate the design procedure and performance of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate differential serum peptide profiling of patients with bone metastasis from primary HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) using MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry), and to seek the potential serum biomarkers for diagnosis of bone metastasis. Methods: The serum samples of 50 patients with bone metastasis from primary HCC and 50 primary HCC patients without bone metastasis were collected. The 100 serum samples were randomly assigned into training set (n = 76) and test set (n = 24). The differential serum peptide profiling of all serum samples were examined by using ClinProt magnetic bead-based purification followed by MALDI-TOF-MS, and the data were analyzed by ClinProTools software. The sequences of serum peptides differentially expressed were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The diagnostic model was established using a learning algorithm of RBFNN (radial basis function neural network) and verified in a single-blind trial. Results: Ten peptide peaks in primary HCC patients with bone metastasis were significantly different from those in primary HCC patients without bone metastasis (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon-test). Of these ten peptides, the sequences of amino acids of seven peptides were successfully identified [the mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) for these seven peptides were 1 780.7, 1 866.5, 2 131.6, 2 880.4, 1 532.4, 2 489.8 and 2 234.3, respectively]. These seven peptides were derived from alpha-fetoprotein, prothrombin, serglycin, isoform 2 of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4, isoform 1 of autophagy-related protein 16-2, transthyretin and fibrinogen beta chain. The recognition rate and the predictive power of the diagnostic model established on the basis of six significant peptides between patients with and without bone metastasis (the m/z for these six peptides were 1 535.4, 1 780.7, 1 866.5, 2 131.6, 2 880.4 and 2 901.9, respectively) were 89.47% and 82.89%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of this model were 83% and 92%, respectively, in a single-blind trial. Conclusion: The differential serum peptide profiling may offer many potential molecules which can be used in the diagnosis of bone metastasis from primary HCC. Copyright © 2012 by TUMOR.",

The exploitation of multifunctional CDs in the area of fluorescent assay is still urgent and attractive. Herein, using a simple two-step heating procedure, positive charged carbon dots (P-CDs) were prepared with the co-doping of the elements of N and S. The morphology, optical properties and stability of P-CDs was investigated. Furthermore, P-CDs show the dual functions of unprecedented quenching performance toward fluorophore-modified DNA coupling the retaining fluorescence of P-CDs self. The quenching effect and mechanism of P-CDs to fluorophore-modified DNA was investigated. The fluorescence and quenching properties of P-CDs were used to design a ratiometric fluorescence platform for DNA based on the complex of P-CDs and FAM-labeled ssDNA. The ratiometric method allows the detection of target DNA because of the different affinities of P-CDs to ssDNA and dsDNA with acceptable sensitivity and improved reproducibility, when using sequence fragment of the gene of Gardnerella vaginalis as model. This method provides a new approach to widen the future of the biological applications based on some special CDs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   It is generally known that the physical and mechanical properties would be greatly degraded after water or moisture transferring into the foamed concrete. In this study, a foamed concrete with a low density of about 550 kg/m 3  is prepared using ordinary Portland cement, and three types of water repellents including potassium trimethylsilanolate (PT), calcium stearate (CS) and siloxane-based polymer (SP) are employed to decrease the water absorption of the foamed concrete. The effects of the water repellent on the mechanical and physical properties of the foamed concrete, such as 7-day and 28-day compressive strength, thermal conductivity, sorptivity and hygroscopicity, are studied. The laboratory results indicate that the water repellents improve the compressive strength to some extent without sacrificing the thermal insulation property of the foamed concrete. The sorptivity evaluated by 48-h water absorption and strength retention coefficient ( R S  ) is significantly improved as increasing the content of water repellent. When 1.0% SP is used, the water absorption and  R S   value of the foamed concrete with 28-day strength of 1.77 MPa and thermal conductivity of 0.150 W/m K are 2.5% (by volume) and 0.989, respectively. In addition, the contents of hygroscopic moisture [ W ( φ )] also decrease with the increasing content of water repellent. The hygroscopic fitted curves with high coefficients of determination obtained the KUM and CUB models have been proved applicable in exploring the relationship of the  W ( φ ) to the relative humidity.",

A delay-range-dependent sufficient condition is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which guarantees the existence of a linear filter. The proposed filter ensures that the filtering error system is stochastically asymptotically stable and that its L 2–L ∞ performance satisfies a prescribed level. The corresponding filter design is cast into a convex optimization problem which can be efficiently handled by using standard numerical algorithms. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Magnesium phosphate cements have the characteristics of fast setting and high early strength, which have been extensively used as rapid repair materials in civil engineering. However, Magnesium Phosphate Cement (MPCs) were also reported to have the disadvantage of water instability and short setting time which was difficult to control. The present research was carried out to evaluate the properties of magnesium phosphate cement with high dosage of metakaolin (MK). Different contents of metakaolin were used to replace magnesium to prepare magnesium phosphate cement. The experimental results showed that the successive additions of MK led to a cumulative increase in setting time to a maximum of 52 min for the compositions investigated, and the intensity of the exothermic reactions was also reduced by MK. Moreover, the additions of MK also improved the strengths of the specimens greatly at the early age, and the compressive strength at 1 h can reach 65.7 MPa. Meanwhile, the water resistance of MPC mortar was also investigated by the form of strength retention, and the results revealed that the addition of MK improved the water resistance after curing for 28 days and 56 days. The improvement mechanism was discussed based on the micro-analysis of XRD, SEM along with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The phase analysis revealed the promotion effect of MK on the hydration of MPC, and confirmed the formation of a new gel. From the microstructural and compositional analyses, the gel was identified as aluminum phosphate (AlPO 4 ), which increased the density of the cement.",

CsA trough level (C(0)) and peak level (C(2)) of 115 patients 1 week and 1 month after renal transplantation were determined. MDR1 C1236T, G2677T/A, C3435T and CYP3A5*3 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays based on amplification refractory mutation. Dose-adjusted C(0) (C(0)/D), C(2) (C(2)/D) were 50.5 +/- 22.5, 267.8 +/- 110.1 ng.kg.(ml.mg)(-1) after 1 week of therapy, and 79.3 +/- 29.4, 406.0 +/- 135.3 ng.kg.(ml.mg)(-1) after 1 month of therapy. Frequencies of MDR1 haplotype TTT, CGC, and TGC were 27.0%, 25.2% and 20.0%, respectively. After 1 month of therapy, C(2)/D of TTT/TTT patients were 30% (p = 0.057) and 53% (p = 0.003) higher than CGC/TTT and CGC/CGC patients. C(0)/D of CYP3A5 *1/*1, *1/*3 and *3/*3 patients after 1 month of therapy were 51.8 +/- 25.0, 71.5 +/- 27.6, and 86.7 +/- 28.6 ng.kg.(ml.mg)(-1) (p < 0.05).

Fuzzy logic systems in Mamdani type are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, then the adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is designed by using the backstepping technique and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. The proposed adaptive fuzzy controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the system output eventually converges to a small neighborhood of the desired reference signal. An advantage of the proposed control scheme lies in that the number of the online adaptive parameters is not more than the order of the original system.

Damage occurring within specimens was also investigated by acoustic emission (AE). Results indicated that the conductivity of the composite was related to the stress level. Under monotonic loading, the electrical resistance decreased with increasing stress at low stress levels and increased with increasing stress at higher stress levels. Under cyclic loading, at lower loading amplitude, the electrical resistance of the system showed reversibility with the change of the load, however, when the loading amplitude was larger, it showed the irreversible increase. Both cases indicated that the breakdown and rebuild-up process of the conductive network under pressure may be responsible for the stress dependency of conductivity. The damage occurring inside material can be monitored in real time by measuring the change in electrical resistance during loading and unloading.",

CL experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) investigation indicated that g-CNQD increased the production of singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide radical (˙O2−), and sulphite radical anion (˙SO3−) in the hydrogen peroxide–hydrosulfite CL system; this could be attributed to the enhanced-CL intensity and gave us new insights into the character of fluorescent carbon nitride quantum dots. Ascorbic acid exerted an inhibition effect on the CL of the hydrogen peroxide–hydrosulfite–g-CNQD CL system. This phenomenon was utilized as a determination method of ascorbic acid in the concentration ranging from 2.85 × 10−7 to 2.85 × 10−4 mol L−1, with a detection limit of 8.0 × 10−8 mol L−1. Ascorbic acid in tablets and injections has been successfully detected with recoveries in the range from 96.2% to 106%.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to establish a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and limited sampling strategy models for the estimation of MPA exposure in Chinese adult renal allograft recipients following oral administration of enteric coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS). A total of 74 sets of full pharmacokinetic profiles and 47 sets of MPA-sparing samples were collected from 102 renal transplant recipients who received oral EC-MPS. The MPA concentration was determined by an enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique, and the pathophysiologic data were recorded. The PPK model was constructed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, and the limited sampling strategy models for MPA were established by using multiple regression analysis and the maximum a posteriori Bayesian assay based on 2 to 4 sampling time points following EC-MPS administration. The pharmacokinetics of MPA were best described by a 2-compartment model with a first-order absorption process and a lag time of absorption. The clearance of MPA was 12.3 ± 1.14 L/h. Comedicating with cyclosporine A was found to have a significant impact on the clearance/bioavailability of MPA (P < .01). Sampling strategies consisted of plasma concentration at 1.5, 2, 4 (C1.5-C2-C4) hours and 1.5, 2, 4, 6 (C1.5-C2-C4-C6) hours after EC-MPS administration were shown to be suitable for the estimation of the MPA area under the concentration-time curve in these patients. The PPK model was acceptable and can describe the pharmacokinetics of MPA in Chinese renal transplant recipients administered EC-MPS. The area under the concentration-time curve of MPA in Chinese renal transplant recipients could be estimated through a limited sampling strategy method, based on which individualized immunosuppressive regimens could be designed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The long setting time of conventional OPC-based foamed concrete usually hinders the next step of constructions. Based on the unique advantages of magnesium phosphate cement (MPC), a novel foamed concrete with the characteristics of quick setting and high early-strength is prepared by using sodium bicarbonate (NAC) as a foaming agent in this study. In order to investigate the mechanical and physical properties systematically, the 3-h and 28-day compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, thermal conductivity and water resistance are measured during the experiments. The laboratory results indicate that the dry density, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, thermal insulation and water resistance decrease as increasing the NAC content. It is notable that the 3-h compressive strength of MPC-based foamed concrete is about 70% of the 28-day compressive strength. The relationships of the modulus of elasticity and splitting tensile strength to compressive strength are analyzed by power functions. And a linear function is suitable to describe the reduction in strength retention coefficient with the increase of the water absorption. The compressive strength and water resistance of MPC-based foamed concrete with a target density of 550 kg/m 3  can be improved by adding the predetermined amount of fly ash. And the 28-day compressive strength and thermal conductivity of MPC-based foamed concrete with 10% fly ash are 2.4 MPa and 0.072 W/mK, which are superior to those of OPC-based foamed concrete with the same dry density.",

The genetic basis for this anti-apoptotic activity and its implication for mycobacterial virulence have not been demonstrated or elucidated. Using a novel gain-of-function genetic screen, we demonstrated that inhibition of infection-induced apoptosis of macrophages is controlled by multiple genetic loci in M. tuberculosis. Characterization of one of these loci in detail revealed that the anti-apoptosis activity was attributable to the type I NADH-dehydrogenase of M. tuberculosis, and was mainly due to the subunit of this multicomponent complex encoded by the nuoG gene. Expression of M. tuberculosis nuoG in nonpathogenic mycobacteria endowed them with the ability to inhibit apoptosis of infected human or mouse macrophages, and increased their virulence in a SCID mouse model. Conversely, deletion of nuoG in M. tuberculosis ablated its ability to inhibit macrophage apoptosis and significantly reduced its virulence in mice. These results identify a key component of the genetic basis for an important virulence trait of M. tuberculosis and support a direct causal relationship between virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria and their ability to inhibit macrophage apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3-D) culture, compared with traditional two-dimensional (2-D) cell culture, can provide physical signals and 3-D matrix close to the in vivo microenvironments. Here, sponge-like collagen scaffolds were used to assess how 3-D culture would affect the differentiation and self-renewal of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Cultured in differentiation medium without growth factors, cells in 3-D collagen scaffolds yielded much higher clone formation efficiency and expressed less neuron marker, TUJ1, compared with cells cultured on 2-D plates. mTOR inactivation was identified and showed to supported the self-renewal of NPCs in 3-D culture. At the same time, REDD1 was highly expressed in cells cultured in 3-D conditions, which blocks the activity of mTOR. Moreover, knocking-down REDD1 induced the differentiation of NPCs in 3-D collagen scaffolds. These results indicated that mTOR inactivation by REDD1 mediated the self-renewal regulation of NPCs in 3-D cultures. Thus, 3-D collagen scaffolds maintained self-renewal properties of NPCs, and the inhibitory regulator of mTOR (such as REDD1) played an important role in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of NPCs.",

The technical success, clinical success, periprocedural complications, target vessel revascularization (TVR), and overall survival were compared between the DES and BMS groups.The technical success rate was 98.3% (119/121) for the DES group vs. 100% for the BMS group (p = 0.503). The clinical success rate was 95.5% (107/112) for the DES group vs. 97.9% (92/94) for the BMS group (p = 0.592). No periprocedural death or stroke occurred. The overall periprocedural complication rate was 2.7% (3/112) in the DES group vs. 4.3% (4/94) in BMS group (p = 0.813). The median follow-up was 43 months (range 3-95) for the DES group and 46 months (range 6-89) for BMS. At last follow-up, the TVR rate was 6.3% (7/112) for the DES group vs. 20.2% (19/94) for the BMS group (p = 0.003); 4 (3.6%) patients in the DES group and 8 (8.5%) patients in the BMS group experienced a VBS stroke (p = 0.132). By life-table analysis, the 5-year TVR rate was 4.5% (5/112) for the DES group vs. 19.1% (18/94) for the BMS group (p = 0.001). No difference was detected in the overall survival curves between the groups (p = 0.500).Both DES and BMS are feasible, safe, and effective for symptomatic VAS. However, DES can significantly decrease the TVR rate in the long term compared with BMS.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate a collagen targeting delivery system for myocardial repair. A specific peptide collagen-binding domain (CBD) was fused to human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to enhance the binding of VEGF to collagen. In this study, collagen membranes loaded with CBD-VEGF, natural VEGF, or phosphate-buffered saline are used as cardiac patches to repair the infarcted myocardium in a rabbit model. CBD-VEGF/collagen group could effectively induce more cells to penetrate into the collagen membrane after 4 weeks and promote more vascularization in infarcted myocardium after 12 weeks compared with the other two control groups. Echocardiography and hemodynamic studies both show cardiac function improvement in the CBD-VEGF/collagen group. These results reveal that implantation of CBD-VEGF collagen membrane patch into the infarcted myocardium could effectively improve left ventricle cardiac function and increase the vascular density.",

Multivariate models revealed that, besides WBC more than 30×10(9)/L and IK6 variant of IKZF1, high MSI2 expression was also an independent prognostic factor for adult BCR-ABL-negative B-ALL.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel adaptive neural control scheme for a class of perturbed strict-feedback nonlinear time-delay systems with unknown virtual control coefficients. Based on the radial basis function neural network online approximation capability, an adaptive neural controller is presented by combining the backstepping approach and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. The proposed controller guarantees the semiglobal boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system and contains minimal learning parameters. Finally, three simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) is an important neurotrophic factor for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair. However, constant exchange of cerebrospinal fluid often decreases the effective dosage of NT3 at the targeted injury site. In the present study, a recombinant collagen-binding NT3 (CBD-NT3), consisting of a collagen-binding domain (CBD) and native NT3, was constructed. Linear rat-tail collagen (LRTC) was used as a physical carrier for CBD-NT3 to construct a LRTC/C3 system. The collagen-binding ability of CBD-NT3 was verified, and the bioactivity of CBD-NT3 was assayed with neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants and DRG cells in vitro. After complete spinal cord transection in rats, LRTC/CBD-NT3 or the LRTC/NT3 system was transplanted into the injury site. Hindlimb locomotion recovery was closely observed using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and the grid walk test. Significant improvement was observed in the LRTC/CBD-NT3 group. The results of regenerating nerve fiber and anterograde tracing of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)-labeled corticospinal tract (CST) fibers demonstrated axonal regeneration of LRTC/CBD-NT3 in the injured spinal cord. Serotonin fiber regrowth also illustrated the effectiveness of LRTC/CBD-NT3. Thus, collagen-binding NT3 with LRTC may provide an effective method for treating SCI.",

During the controller design, fuzzy logic systems are used to model uncertain nonlinear function, then an adaptive fuzzy control scheme is designed. It is proven that the developed controller can suppress the chaotic behavior of the original system and guarantee that all the signals eventually converge to a small neighborhood around the origin. The main advantage lies in that only one adaptive parameter needs to be estimated online for the original systems with five uncertain parameters. Simulation results further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2013 IEEE.",

The photon-induced current increase through the Ge/Oxide structured RRAM is explained by the photon-assisted tunneling mechanism when the RRAM is at the low-resistance state. Furthermore, the good output and transfer characteristics, which could be controlled by the light, of the phototransistor are also demonstrated. Since, when both RRAM devices are at the high-resistance state, the structure does not show any optical sensitivity, the phototransistor realized in this letter is programmable. This programmable phototransistor may significantly enhance the performance of photon-electric integrated circuits and reduce the circuit design and fabrication cost.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To prepare pneumococcal conjugate vaccine using pneumolysin as a protein carrier and evaluate its immunogenicity in mice. Methods: The DNA fragment encoding for pneumolysin was amplified by PCR and cloned into plasmid pET-28a, and then the recombinant DNA was transfered to host cell E. coli JM109 (DE3). The recombinant pneumolysin (rPn) was expressed in, vivo and purified by Ni-NTA. The SDS-PAGE was used to identify the rPn. This protein was detoxified by 0.2% or 0.5% formalin. Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PS, 19F serotype) was conjugated with detoxified rPn using amino reductive method. The conjugate was mixed with the adjuvant Al2 (OH)3 before vaccination. The antibody response against PS or Pn was measured by ELISA. Results: The inserted pneumolysin gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing and the pneumolysin protein was successfully expressed. The relative molecular mass of the expressed product was 52 × 103. This recombinant pneumolysin was detoxified by 0.2% or 0.5% formalin. The PS (19F serotype) was successfully conjugated with rPn. There was a significant difference of antibody titer against PS or Pn between vaccinated and non- vaccinated mice (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The recombinant pneumolysin can obtained by genetic engineering technology. The PS and rPn conjugate vaccine produced by amino reductive method induced specific immune response in mice.",

        "abstract": "Minimal residual disease (MRD) is of the most important factor for predicting prognosis and guiding treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, we investigated the prognostic significance of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) as assessment of index of MRD in 125 adult B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) patients by eight-color flow cytometry. The LAIPs could be identified in 96% and 81.6% of patients with the sensitivity of 10(-4) and 10(-5), respectively. MRD-negative status could clearly predict a favorable 2-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at the end of induction of complete remission and one cycle of consolidation treatment. Moreover, we identified a group of cases with MRD of 0.001% to <0.01%, which showed significantly higher 2-year relapse rate than those with undetectable one. In multivariate analysis, MRD status was associated with RFS or OS independently. Furthermore, MRD assessed by LAIPs and RQ-PCR assay for patients with BCR-ABL fusion gene yielded concordant results in 89.7% of cases. In conclusion, MRD evaluated by eight-color flow cytometry could provide an important tool to assess treatment response and prognosis precisely in adult B-ALL.",

The memory cell performance for a horizontal cross-point is shown experimentally to be essentially comparable to vertical pillar-around geometry. Array performances (read/write, energy, and speed) of different 3D architectures are investigated by SPICE simulation, showing horizontal stacked RRAM is superior but suffers from higher bit cost. Adopting a bi-layer pillar electrode structure is demonstrated to enlarge the array size in 3D vertical RRAM. Design guidelines are proposed for the 3D VRRAM: it shows that increasing the number of stacks of VRRAM while keeping the total bits the same, as well as scaling of feature size (F), are critical for reducing RC delay and energy consumption. © 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Three adult patients with de novo acute myelold leukemia of distinct subtypes harboring t(11;12)(p15;q13) have been investigated to characterize the genes involved in that translocation. Through molecular cytogenetics, a chromosome break was detected at the 3′ part of nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) gene at 11p15. Using rapid amplification of cDNA end, we identified the partner gene at 12q13, HOXC11. Molecular analysis showed that exon 12 of NUP98 was fused in-frame to exon 2 of HOXC11 in all three cases with t(11;12)(p15;q13). Therefore, this type of fusion may represent the major form of the NUP98-HOXC11 chimera so far reported. Moreover, two out of three cases had a confirmed deletion of the 3′ part of NUP98 gene and more telomeric region of 11p harboring a group of tumor-suppressor genes. Interestingly, the NUP98-HOXC11 protein when assayed in a GAL4 reporter system, showed an aberrant trans-regulatory activity as compared to the wild-type HOXC11 in both COS-7 and HL-60 cells. Therefore, NUP98-HOXC11 may contribute to the leukemogenesis by interfering with the cellular mechanism of transcriptional regulation.",

The resulting materials were characterized in terms of their setting characteristics, strength properties, hydration products, and microstructures. The replacement of PDP by DHP was found to increase the setting time and reduce the intensity of the exothermic reactions during the initial setting and hardening stages. When the replacement percentage did not reach 50%, substitution of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate for potassium dihydrogen phosphate in the MPC paste could strike a good balance between the speedy strength gains and delayed setting time. The setting time of the MPC system increased from 5 min (without DHP addition) to 180 min with PDP replaced by DHP completely. The addition of borax also led to an extension of the initial hardening period, as indicated by reductions in...",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death worldwide, despite the availability of effective chemotherapy and a vaccine. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the tuberculosis vaccine, is an attenuated mutant of Mycobacterium bovis that was isolated after serial subcultures, yet the functional basis for this attenuation has never been elucidated. A single region (RD1), which is absent in all BCG substrains, was deleted from virulent M. bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and the resulting DeltaRD1 mutants were significantly attenuated for virulence in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice. The M. tuberculosis DeltaRD1 mutants were also shown to protect mice against aerosol challenge, in a similar manner to BCG. Interestingly, the DeltaRD1 mutants failed to cause cytolysis of pneumocytes, a phenotype that had been previously used to distinguish virulent M. tuberculosis from BCG. A specific transposon mutation, which disrupts the Rv3874 Rv3875 (cfp-10 esat-6) operon of RD1, also caused loss of the cytolytic phenotype in both pneumocytes and macrophages. This mutation resulted in the attenuation of virulence in mice, as the result of reduced tissue invasiveness. Moreover, specific deletion of each transcriptional unit of RD1 revealed that three independent transcriptional units are required for virulence, two of which are involved in the secretion of ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target). We conclude that the primary attenuating mechanism of bacillus Calmette-Guérin is the loss of cytolytic activity mediated by secreted ESAT-6, which results in reduced tissue invasiveness.",

        "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a respiratory pathogen, and mucosal immune response plays a significant role in the defense against pneumococcal infections. Thus, intranasal vaccination may be an alternative approach to current immunization strategies, and effective delivery systems to mucosal organism are necessary. In this study, BALB/c mice were immunized intranasally with chitosan-DNA nanoparticles expressing pneumococcal surface antigen A (PsaA). Compared to levels in mice immunized with naked DNA or chitosan-pVAX1, anti-PsaA IgG antibody in serum and anti-IgA antibody in mucosal lavages were elevated significantly in mice immunized with chitosan-psaA. The balanced IgG1/IgG2a antibody ratio in serum, enhanced gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and IL-17A levels in spleen lymphocytes, and mucosal washes of mice immunized with chitosan-psaA suggested that cellular immune responses were induced. Furthermore, significantly fewer pneumococci were recovered from the nasopharynx of mice immunized with chitosan-psaA than for the control group following intranasal challenge with ATCC 6303 (serotype 3). These results demonstrated that mucosal immunization with chitosan-psaA may successfully generate mucosal and systemic immune responses and prevent pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization. Hence, a chitosan-DNA nanoparticle vaccine expressing pneumococcal major immunodominant antigens after intranasal administration could be developed to prevent pneumococcal infections.",

        "abstract": "We report follow-up XMM-Newton and optical observations of three new polars found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Simple modeling of the X-ray spectra, and consideration of the details of the X-ray and optical lightcurves corroborate the polar nature of these three systems and pro- vide further insights into their accretion characteristics. During the XMM-Newton observation of SDSS J072910.68+365838.3, X-rays are undetected apart from a probable flare event, during which we find both the typical hard X-ray bremsstrahlung component and a very strong O VII (E = 0.57 keV) line, but no evidence of a soft blackbody contribution. In SDSS J075240.45+362823.2 we identify an X-ray eclipse at the beginning of the observation, roughly in phase with the primary minimum of the optical broad band curve. The X-ray spectra require the presence of both hard and soft X-ray compo- nents, with their luminosity ratio consistent with that found in other recent XMM-Newton results on polars. Lastly, SDSS J170053.30+400357.6 appears optically as a very typical polar, however its large amplitude optical modulation is 180◦ out of phase with the variation in our short X-ray lightcurve.

The stochastic stability and finite-time stability are considered. Some stability criteria including infinite matrix inequalities are obtained by parameter-dependent Lyapunov function. Furthermore, infinite matrix inequalities are converted into finite linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) via a set of slack matrices.

SFRP5 expression increases during the differentiation and maturation of adipocytes, but the factors regulating SFRP5 expression during this process remain unclear. This study showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) adenovirus transfection could enhance the SFRP5 expression of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Three potential binding sites of PPARγ in the SFRP5 promoter domain were found by bioinformatics analysis. Luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that PPARγ regulated the activity of the SFRP5 promoter through cis-acting elements at -2,284--1,500bp. Further experiments verified that PPARγ could specifically bind to the SFRP5 promoter at -2,284--2,263bp using chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These results suggest that SFRP5 be a target gene of PPARγ, and its expression may be under the transcriptional regulation of PPARγ.",

Then, through all products'pursuit of their own maximal output, maximum utilization of production line and manufacturing resources were realized. And the judging basis for output mix feasibility and solving approach on maximal output in mixed production line were proposed based on load rate of bottle-neck unit. In the process of solving maximum output mix, the definition and search algorithm of Nash equilibrium were put forward. Finally, an aero-engine casing production line was taken as the research object, then the optimal product mix of two given examples under output demand uncertainty was obtained. By comparing to integer programming, genetic algorithm and tabu search, effectiveness and feasibility of game model were proved.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes can impair neovascularization important for wound healing, and this study investigated the hypothesis that this effect can be reversed by an active provisional matrix. Here, a 3D collagen scaffold and uncultured adipose-derived SVFs were firstly utilized to construct a collagen-targeting system for wound healing in a diabetic porcine model. The diabetic porcine models were made by injected streptozocin (STZ) intravenously and removed full thickness skin from the dorsum. Each animal received four different samples: Group A (control groups, n=24), Group B (SVFs groups, n=24), Group C (scaffold groups, n=24), Group D (SVFs -scaffold groups, n=24). PBS was applied to the wounds in Group A. 1×105 SVFs suspended in PBS were sprayed on the wounds in Group B. Scaffolds only with PBS were covered on the wounds in Group C. Scaffolds with equal volume of cell suspension containing 1×105 SVFs were covered on the wounds in Group D. The healing rates were calculated and compared among the groups and the tissues of the wound were taken and evaluated for histological analysis. The diabetic wound treated with the SVFs -collagen scaffold showed a significant decrease in wound size, an increase of neovascularization and a maximum VEGF and bFGF expression in comparison with SVFs and scaffold alone. The SVFs -collagen scaffold accelerates wound healing since it stimulates higher capillary formation causes major proangiogenesis factors expression in diabetic pigs suffering from skin defects, suggesting this approach could have utility for diabetic wound healing.",

A total of 205 patients who received canal wall-down tympanoplasty with ossicular chain reconstruction were randomized into one of the three groups with different MEPA. Group 1 (n = 72) received MeroGel as the MEPA, Group 2 (n = 64) cartilage, and Group 3 (n = 69) both. Air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were measured, and air-bone gaps (ABG) were analyzed before and after the surgery for each patient.Mean pre- and post-operative ABG was 30.9 dB and 17.6 dB in Group 1, 31.4 dB and 21.9 dB in Group 2, and 32.2 dB and 19.1 dB in Group 3. The ABG closure was 13.3 ± 7.5 in Group 1, 9.5 ± 5.9 in Group 2, and 13.1 ± 9.3 in Group 3. The improvement of ABG after surgery was statistically significant in all three groups (p < .05). The ABG closure was statistically significantly smaller in Group 2 than in other two groups (p < .05).Tympanoplasty using esterified hyaluronic acid (i.e. MeroGel) or cartilage as the MEPA resulted in improved hearing for patients with conductive hearing loss due to adhesive OM. Using MeroGel as the MEPA appeared to achieve a better post-operative outcome than using cartilage.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of H∞ stabilization for nonuniform sampling fuzzy systems. A method to design a fuzzy controller is proposed by taking the variation ranges of membership functions within sampling intervals into consideration. To reduce the computational complexity, Jensen's integral inequality method is employed. Based on a well-known inequality, a convex combination technique is developed to deal with nonlinear time-varying coefficients derived from Jensen's integral inequality. Combining with capturing the characteristic of sampled-data systems with a novel piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), a less complex and less conservative H∞ stabilization criterion is formulated as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily checked by using standard numerical software. Some illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the significant improvement on the existing results. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "To explore the genetic abnormalities that cooperate with AML1-ETO (AE) fusion gene to cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21), we screened a number of candidate genes and identified 11 types of mutations in C-KIT gene (mC-KIT), including 6 previously undescribed ones among 26 of 54 (48.1%) cases with t(8;21). To address a possible chronological order between AE and mC-KIT, we showed that, among patients with AE and mC-KIT, most leukemic cells at disease presentation harbored both genetic alteration, whereas in three such cases investigated during complete remission, only AE, but not mC-KIT, could be detected by allele-specific PCR. Therefore, mC-KIT should be a subsequent event on the basis of t(8;21). Furthermore, induced expression of AE in U937-A/E cells significantly up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of C-KIT. This may lead to an alternative way of C-KIT activation and may explain the significantly higher C-KIT expression in 81.3% of patients with t(8;21) than in patients with other leukemias. These data strongly suggest that t(8;21) AML follows a stepwise model in leukemogenesis, i.e., AE represents the first, fundamental genetic hit to initiate the disease, whereas activation of the C-KIT pathway may be a second but also crucial hit for the development of a full-blown leukemia. Additionally, Gleevec suppressed the C-KIT activity and induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in cells bearing C-KIT N822K mutation or overexpression, but not in cells with D816 mC-KIT. Gleevec also exerted a synergic effect in apoptosis induction with cytarabine, thus providing a potential therapeutic for t(8;21) leukemia.",

METHODS: Blood samples were collected from liver transplant patients who received tacrolimus . The CYP3A5 and MDR1 genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP method. Tacrolimus tough concentration was measured by FPIA. The concentration/dose ratio was determined at 7, 14 d and 1 month after liver transplantation. RESULTS: The concentration/dose ratios of patients with CYP3A5 * 1/ * 1 and CYP3A5 * 1/ * 3 carrier were significantly lower than those with CYP3A5 * 3 * 3 patients at 7, 14 d and 1 month after liver transplantation. No difference was found among the MDR1 genotypes. CONCLUSION: CYP3A5 * 3 polymorphism is correlated with the whole blood concentration/dose ratio in Chinese liver transplant patients. Clinical application of pharmacogenetic studies will be significant for the individualization of tacrolimus dosage.",
