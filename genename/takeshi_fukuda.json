        "title": "A case of IgG4-related disease with rectal cancer",
        "abstract": "Abstract A 72-year-old male with liver dysfunction and an increase in serum total protein/albumin (TP/Alb) ratio was referred to our hospital. There was a marked increase in serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 level (IgG/IgG4: 3,485/2,860 mg/dl). Diagnostic imaging did not reveal any enlargement of the pancreas or narrowing of the pancreatic duct. However, bilateral submaxillary gland swelling, sclerosing cholangitis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis were noted, suggesting multifocal fibrosclerosis. Histological examination of the submaxillary gland showed the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells, although there was no narrowing of the pancreatic duct, leading to a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease with various extrapancreatic lesions. Systemic investigation before the introduction of steroid therapy revealed rectal cancer. After low-position anterior resection, steroid therapy was introduced, reducing the lesions. Recent studies have reported autoimmune pancreatitis/IgG4-related disease with malignant tumors. However, the association and pathogenesis remain to be clarified. Malignant tumors are detected before or after the treatment of autoimmune pancreatitis/IgG4-related disease; pretreatment diagnosis and post-treatment follow-up should be carefully performed, bearing in mind the concomitant development of malignant tumors.",

        "title": "Efficacy of Alfacalcidol on PEG-IFN/ Ribavirin Combination Therapy for Elderly Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C: A Pilot Study.",
        "abstract": "Serum vitamin D concentration is reported to show a decrease in older age. Patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Japan are older on average than those in Western countries. Moreover, the outcome of pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN)/ ribavirin therapy combined with vitamin D in elderly patients is unclear.This pilot study explored the efficacy and safety of alfacalcidol as vitamin D source in PEG-IFN/ ribavirin combination therapy for elderly CHC patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1b.Consecutive twenty CHC patients aged \u2265 65 years were enrolled in this pilot study. Fifteen patients met the inclusion criteria and received PEG-IFN/ ribavirin therapy combined with alfacalcidol. Four-week lead-in of oral alfacalcidol was conducted, and it was subsequently and concurrently administered in PEG-IFN/ ribavirin combination therapy (vitamin D group). Age, gender, and IL28B genotype-matched patients, who received PEG-IFN/ ribavirin alone, were saved as control group (n = 15) to compare the treatment outcome with the vitamin D group.Subjects consisted of 14 males and 16 females, with a median age of 70 years (65-78). The serum 25 (OH) D3 concentration in females (20 ng/ml, 11-37) was significantly lower than males (27 ng/mL, 13-49) (P = 0.004). Sustained virological response (SVR) rates were 33.3% (5/15) in the control group and 80.0% (12/15) in the vitamin D group, respectively (P = 0.025). While no significant difference was shown in the (SVR) rate between the two groups among males (P = 0.592), in females the SVR rate was significantly higher in the vitamin D group (87.5%, 7/8) than the control group (25.0%, 2/8) (P = 0.041). The relapse rates in the groups with and without alfacalcidol were 7.7% (1/13) and 61.5% (8/13), respectively (P = 0.011). Interestingly, in females, the relapse in the control group was shown in 5 of 7 (71.4%), whereas in the vitamin D group the relapse rate was decreased (1/8, 12.5%) (P = 0.041). No specific adverse events were observed in the vitamin D group.PEG-IFN/ ribavirin combined with alfacalcidol may be effective and safe in elderly CHC patients. In particular, concomitant administration of alfacalcidol may lead to a reduced relapse rate, and consequently improving the SVR rate in elderly females.",

        "abstract": "Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has recently been reported to be effective in the treatment of cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. However, the clinical utility of TIPS in the subset of refractory ascitic patients with good hepatic and renal function is uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of TIPS to that of large-volume paracentesis in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites who have good hepatic and renal function.Sixty cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites who presented with a Child-Pugh score of <11, serum bilirubin of <3 mg/dl and creatinine of <1.9 mg/dl were assigned randomly to TIPS (n = 30) or large-volume paracentesis plus albumin (n = 30). The primary endpoint was survival. The secondary endpoints were response to treatment and development of hepatic encephalopathy.The baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Seventeen patients treated with TIPS and 21 treated with paracentesis died during the study period. The cumulative probabilities of survival at 1 and 2 years were 80 and 64% in the TIPS group and 49 and 35% in the paracentesis group (p < 0.005). TIPS was significantly superior to paracentesis in the control of ascites (p < 0.005). Treatment failure was more frequent in the paracentesis group, whereas the frequency of hepatic encephalopathy was greater in the TIPS group.In cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites who have good hepatic and renal function, TIPS improves survival and provides better control of ascites than large-volume paracentesis.",

        "abstract": "Terlipressin has been shown to be effective in the management of hepatorenal syndrome. However, how terlipressin exerts its effect on the renal artery is unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of terlipressin on systemic, hepatic and renal hemodynamics in cirrhosis.Twenty-eight patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension were studied. Systemic and hepatic hemodynamics, hepatic and renal arterial resistive indices and neurohumoral factors were measured prior to and 30 min after intravenous administration of 1 mg terlipressin (n = 19) or placebo (n = 9).After terlipressin, there were significant increases in both mean arterial pressure (P < 0.001) and systemic vascular resistance (P < 0.001), whereas heart rate (P < 0.001) and cardiac output (P < 0.001) decreased significantly. There was a significant decrease in the hepatic venous pressure gradient (P < 0.001). Portal venous blood flow also decreased significantly (P < 0.001). The mean hepatic arterial velocity increased significantly (P < 0.001). Although there was a significant decrease in the hepatic arterial resistive index (0.72 +/- 0.08 to 0.69 +/- 0.08, P < 0.001) and renal arterial resistive index (0.74 +/- 0.07 to 0.68 +/- 0.07, P < 0.001), portal vascular resistance was unchanged (P = 0.231). Plasma renin activity decreased significantly (P < 0.005), and there was a significant correlation between this decline and the decrease in renal arterial resistive index (r = 0.764, P < 0.005). The effects of terlipressin on systemic, hepatic and renal hemodynamics were observed similarly in patients with and without ascites. Placebo caused no significant effects.Terlipressin decreases hepatic and renal arterial resistance in patients with cirrhosis.",

The operation was uneventful, and the patient did not experience new neurologic deficits upon recovery from anesthesia. Brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) obtained immediately after CEA showed a perfusion defect in the right parietal lobe and absence of cerebral hyperperfusion. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed no new abnormal findings. Aspirin therapy was instituted postoperatively. On the second postoperative day, the patient experienced abrupt worsening of left hemiparesis, and subsequent CT imaging demonstrated a hematoma in the right parietal lobe. Cerebral hyperperfusion was absent on repeat SPECT.Perioperative cerebral ischemia can result in intracerebral hemorrhage after CEA even in the absence of cerebral hyperperfusion and/or anticoagulation therapy. Further, cerebral perfusion imaging performed immediately after CEA is a useful modality for the identification of occult cerebral ischemia or hyperperfusion that may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage.",

        "abstract": "Neuropsychological testing detects cognitive impairment in 20% to 30% of patients after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).A 51-year-old man with asymptomatic right cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis underwent a CEA. Intraoperative transcranial regional cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring revealed ischemia in the right cerebral hemisphere during ICA clamping and transient hyperemia subsequent to ICA declamping. The patient recovered without the appearance of new neurologic deficits. Brain single-photon emission computed tomography performed immediately after CEA showed a decrease in cerebral blood flow in the right cerebral hemisphere. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed no new abnormal findings. Positron emission tomography performed 2 months after surgery revealed decreased cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in the right cerebral hemisphere, and neuropsychological testing demonstrated a decline in performance IQ relative to preoperative levels.Intraoperative ischemia and postischemic delayed hypoperfusion in CEA can impair cognition even in the absence of development of postoperative neurologic deficit.",

The purpose of the present case cohort study with historical control was to determine whether pretreatment with a novel free radical scavenger, edaravone, could prevent development of cognitive impairment after CEA.Fifty-five patients with ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (> or =70%) underwent CEA with administration of edaravone before ICA clamping. Neuropsychological testing was performed preoperatively and at the first postoperative month. Cerebral blood flow was also measured using single-photon emission computed tomography before and immediately after CEA and on the third postoperative day.Postoperative cognitive impairment was observed in only 1 (2%) patient, who exhibited postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion (cerebral blood flow increase > or =100% compared with preoperative values). Incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment in the control group (92 CEA patients without administration of edaravone) was significantly higher (12%) (P = .0298, control vs treatment group). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion and absence of pretreatment with edaravone were significant independent predictors of postoperative cognitive impairment.Pretreatment with edaravone can prevent development of cognitive impairment after CEA.",

        "abstract": "Hypoxic cells play a key role in the radioresistance of malignant glioma. Interferon-beta, ACNU as nimustine hydrochloride and radiotherapy (IAR) is a common therapy for malignant glioma in Japan. Since hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) increases oxygen pressure in glioma tissue, we applied a modified IAR therapy, radiotherapy after HBO combined with interferon-beta and ACNU (HBO/IAR therapy), for supratentorial malignant gliomas. Daily radiation therapy was completed within 15 min after HBO. We assessed HBO/IAR with respect to toxicity, response rates and the time of tumor progression (TTP). We also examined the incidence of responses by some prognostic factors before HBO/IAR, namely, age, Karnofsky performance scale (KPS), histological type, tumor size, tumor site and operation type. Of 39 patients who participated in this study, 35 underwent a complete schedule of HBO/IAR therapy in which toxicity was permissible. Thirty patients (76.9%) either maintained or increased KPS during HBO/IAR with a mean duration of 68 +/- 14 days. The response rates (CR + PR%) for glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and overall were 50%, 30% and 43%, respectively. The incidence of therapeutic responses among all prognostic factors before HBO/IAR did not significantly differ. Median TTP for patients with glioblastoma, patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, and overall were 38, 56 and 43 weeks, respectively. The present study suggested that HBO/IAR therapy could be applied to especially patients with poor prognostic factors, because of its short treatment period, its permissible toxicity and identical response to patients with good prognostic factors.",

Perfusion-weighted MRI (PW MRI) can measure the cerebral blood volume (CBV) as an indicator of hemodynamic impairment. CBV measured by PW MRI was compared with CVR measured by positron emission tomography (PET).Twelve normal subjects and 17 patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease underwent PW MRI and PET. The images were coregistered with 3-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition images. Quantitative PW MRI-CBV maps were generated using the indicator dilution method with arterial input function. One large cortical region of interest for each unilateral middle cerebral artery territory was determined on each image. PET-CVR was calculated by measuring cerebral blood flow before and after acetazolamide challenge.A significant negative correlation was observed between PW MRI-CBV and PET-CVR (r=-0.713; P<0.0001). PW MRI-CBV higher than the mean +2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.2 mL/100 g) was defined as elevated and PET-CVR lower than the mean -2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.1%) was defined as reduced. Assuming the PET-CVR as the true determinant of hemodynamic impairment, PW MRI-CBV provided 80.0% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity, with 80.0% positive predictive value for detecting patients with reduced CVR.The PW MRI-CBV method can simply and accurately identify patients with hemodynamic impairment without exposure to ionizing radiation.",

The postoperative course was uneventful until the patient developed headache and agitated delirium on the 4th postoperative day.Perfusion computed tomographic imaging demonstrated hyperperfusion in the right temporal lobe. The symptoms resolved by institution of intensive blood pressure control. Positron emission tomography performed 2 months after surgery demonstrated a postoperative reduction of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in the right temporal lobe, where brain atrophy was observed on magnetic resonance images 3 months postoperatively. Neuropsychological testing performed 3 months postoperatively showed worsening digit span, which adversely affected the patient's quality of life.The current case suggests that cerebral hyperperfusion after vascular reconstructive surgery can cause irreversible neural damage, which results in cognitive impairment.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a rare but potentially devastating complication. The purpose of the present study, which was not a randomized controlled trial but a case cohort study with historical control, was to determine whether pretreatment with a novel free radical scavenger, edaravone, could prevent occurrence of cerebral hyperperfusion after CEA.Fifty patients with ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (>/=70%) underwent CEA with administration of edaravone before internal carotid artery clamping. Preoperative cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to acetazolamide were assessed with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Cerebral blood flow also was measured immediately after CEA and on the 3rd postoperative day.Cerebral hyperperfusion (cerebral blood flow increase >/=100% compared with preoperative values) was revealed by SPECT performed immediately after CEA in only one patient (2%), who also exhibited reduced preoperative CVR. The incidence of post-CEA hyperperfusion as revealed by SPECT in the control group (51 CEA patients without administration of edaravone) was significantly higher (16%) (P = 0.0310, control versus treatment group). In addition, in a subgroup of patients with reduced preoperative CVR, the incidence of post-CEA hyperperfusion as revealed by SPECT in the edaravone group (7%) was significantly lower than that in the control group (67%) (P = 0.0029). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that reduced preoperative CVR and absence of pretreatment with edaravone were significant independent predictors of post-CEA hyperperfusion as revealed by SPECT.Pretreatment with edaravone can prevent occurrence of cerebral hyperperfusion after CEA.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome is a rare but serious complication of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The aim of the present study was to determine whether intraoperative blood flow velocity (BFV) monitoring in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) could be used as a reliable technique to detect cerebral hyperperfusion following CEA by comparing findings with those of brain single photon emission CT (SPECT).Intraoperative BFV monitoring was attempted in 67 patients undergoing CEA for treatment of ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (> or =70%). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was also assessed using SPECT, which was performed before and immediately after CEA.Intraoperative BFV monitoring was achieved in 60 patients. Of the 60 patients, post-CEA hyperperfusion (CBF increase > or =100%, compared with preoperative values) was observed in six patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the BFV increases immediately after declamping of the ICA for detecting post-CEA hyperperfusion was 100%, 94% and 67%, respectively, with a cut-off point 2.0-fold that of preclamping BFV. The sensitivity and specificity of the BFV increases at the end of the procedure for detecting post-CEA hyperperfusion were 100% for both parameters, with cut-off points of 2.0- to 2.2-fold BFV of preclamping value. Hyperperfusion syndrome developed in two patients with post-CEA hyperperfusion, but intracerebral hemorrhage did not occur. In one of these two patients, BFV monitoring was not possible because of failure to obtain an adequate bone window.Intraoperative MCA BFV monitoring by using TCD is a less reliable method to detect cerebral hyperperfusion following CEA than postoperative MCA BFV monitoring, provided adequate monitoring can be achieved.",

        "abstract": "Given a huge database, we address the problem of finding association rules for numeric attributes, such as( Balance \u2208 I )\u21d2( CardLoan = yes ),which implies that bank customers whose balances fall in a range I are likely to use card loan with a probability greater than p . The above rule is interesting only if the range I has some special feature with respect to the interrelation between Balance and CardLoan . It is required that the number of customers whose balances are contained in I (called the support of I ) is sufficient and also that the probability p of the condition CardLoan = yes being met (called the confidence ratio ) be much higher than the average probability of the condition over all the data. Our goal is to realize a system that finds such appropriate ranges automatically. We mainly focus on computing two optimized ranges : one that maximizes the support on the condition that the confidence ratio is at least a given threshold value, and another that maximizes the confidence ratio on the condition that the support is at least a given threshold number. Using techniques from computational geometry, we present novel algorithms that compute the optimized ranges in linear time if the data are sorted. Since sorting data with respect to each numeric attribute is expensive in the case of huge databases that occupy much more space than the main memory, we instead apply randomized bucketing as the preprocessing method and thus obtain an efficient rule-finding system. Tests show that our implementation is fast not only in theory but also in practice. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to compute optimized rules for all combinations of hundreds of numeric and Boolean attributes in a reasonable time.",

When it comes to handling numeric attributes,conventional methods are inefficient if any numeric attributesare strongly correlated. Our approach offers one solution tothis problem. For each pair of numeric attributes with strongcorrelation, we compute a two-dimensional association rule withrespect to these attributes and the objective attribute of thedecision tree. In particular, we consider a family {\\calR} of grid-regions in the plane associated with the pairof attributes. For R \\in {\\cal R}, the data canbe split into two classes: data inside R and dataoutside R. We compute the region R_{opt}\\in {\\cal R} that minimizes the entropy of the splitting,and add the splitting associated with R_{opt} (foreach pair of strongly correlated attributes) to the set of candidatetests in an entropy-based heuristic. We give efficient algorithmsfor cases in which {\\cal R} is (1) x-monotone connectedregions, (2) based-monotone regions, (3) rectangles, and (4)rectilinear convex regions. The algorithm has been implementedas a subsystem of SONAR (System for Optimized Numeric AssociationRules) developed by the authors. We have confirmed that we cancompute the optimal region efficiently. And diverse experimentsshow that our approach can create compact trees whose accuracyis comparable with or better than that of conventional trees.More importantly, we can grasp non-linear correlation among numericattributes which could not be found without our region splitting.",

From observed containments of transaction execution time periods, we estimate the probabilities of accidental and non-accidental containments, and build a competitive model for discovering direct dependencies by using a model estimation method based on the online EM algorithm. Utilizing the discovered dependency information, we also propose a hierarchical problem detection framework, where microscopic dependency information is incorporated with a macroscopic anomaly metric that monitors the behavior of the system as a whole. This feature is made possible by employing a network-based design which provides overall information of the system without any impact on the performance.",

We consider two classes of regions, rectangles and admissible (i.e. connected and x-monotone) regions. For each class, we propose efficient algorithms for computing the regions that give optimal association rules for gain, support, and confidence, respectively.

A structured association pattern is a set of sets of items that can represent a two level structure in some specified set of target data. Although the structure is very simple, it cannot be extracted by conventional pattern discovery algorithms. We present an algorithm that discovers all frequent structured association patterns. We were motivated to consider the problem by a specific text mining application, but our method is applicable to a broad range of data mining applications. Experiments with synthetic and real data show that our algorithm efficiently discovers structured association patterns in a large volume of data.",

The quality of a segmentation is defined by an objective function suitable for the user's objective, such as \"mean squared error,\" \"mutual information,\" or \"\\chi^2,\" each of which is defined in terms of the distribution of a given target attribute. Our goal is to find value groups on a given conditional domain that split databases into two segments, optimizing the value of an objective function. Though the problem is intractable for general objective functions, there are feasible algorithms for finding high quality binary segmentations when the objective function is convex, and we prove that the typical criteria mentioned above are all convex. We propose two practical algorithms, based on computational geometry techniques, which find a much better value group than conventional heuristics.",

The above rule is interesting only if the range 1 has some special feature with respect to the interrelation between Balance and CardLoan. It is required that the number of customers whose balances are contained in 1 (called the support of 1) is sufficient, and also that the probability p (called the confidence raho) should be much higher than the average probability of the condition being met. Our goal is to realize a system that finds such appropriate ranges automatically. We mainly focus on computing two optimized ranges: one that maximizes the support on the condition that the confidence ratio is at least a given threshold value, and another that maximizes the confidence ratio on the condition that the support is at least a given threshold number.",

        "abstract": "Production of chemoattractants by bronchial epithelial cells may contribute to the local accumulation of inflammatory cells in patients with bronchial asthma and other pulmonary diseases. Recently, interleukin (IL)-16 (lymphocyte chemoattractant factor) was reported to be a potent chemotactic stimulus for CD4(+) T lymphocytes and eosinophils, the types of leukocyte found in the proximity of bronchial epithelium in asthmatic individuals. To test the possibility that bronchial epithelial cells produce IL-16, we analyzed RNA and culture supernatants from the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. BEAS-2B constitutively expressed IL-16 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein; IL-16 expression was significantly upregulated in a concentration-dependent manner within 24 h by stimulation with histamine, IL-1beta, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha whereas interferon-gamma did not significantly increase IL-16. Findings in BEAS-2B cells were confirmed in primary bronchial epithelial cells. Using TA cloning, IL-16 was cloned from BEAS-2B airway epithelial cells. Sequence analysis confirmed its near identity with lymphocyte-derived IL-16. The combination of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha had an additive effect on IL-16 expression. This combination of cytokines also had a priming effect on histamine-induced IL-16 mRNA expression, which was observed within 24 h and which increased to at least 48 h after stimulation. The IL-16 expression induced by histamine and combined cytokines was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 microg/ml). Pretreatment with dexamethasone also significantly suppressed the expression of IL-16, in a concentration-dependent manner. Sputum samples from asthmatic subjects were found to have higher levels of IL-16 than were samples from subjects with other pulmonary inflammatory diseases. These findings suggest that bronchial epithelial cells have the capacity to produce IL-16 after stimulation with histamine, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha, and raise the possibility that epithelium-derived IL-16 may play a role in recruitment of eosinophils and CD4(+) T lymphocytes in the airways. Downregulation of IL-16 expression by dexamethasone suggests that glucocorticoids may inhibit airway inflammation partly by suppressing the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines including IL-16.",

        "abstract": "The basic pathological features of bronchial asthma can be explained on the basis of chronic airway inflammation, involving inflammatory cells such as T cells (particularly type 2 helper T, Th2, cells) and mast cells, and airway remodeling. Many aspects of airway remodeling remain unclear at the molecular level. Recent attention has focused on the role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a fibrogenic cytokine, in airway remodeling. Currently available evidence suggests that airway remodeling is caused by an imbalance in regulatory mechanisms mediated by Smads, a family of signal-transducing molecules.We studied the effects of the Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the regulatory cytokine IL-10 on the expression of inhibitory Smad7 protein in bronchial epithelial cells.Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was employed.Stimulation with IL-10 upregulated the expression of Smad7 compared with control. Neither IL-5 nor GM-CSF induced Smad7 expression. Smad7 expression was upregulated by IL-10 plus either IL-5 or GM-CSF. IL-10 inhibited the expression of TGF-beta-inducible early gene, which is known to downregulate Smad7 expression.Our results suggest that IL-10 acts as a regulatory cytokine in the inhibition of airway inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Smad7 is an intracellular antagonist of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling, which could determine the intensity or duration of the TGF-beta signal. Because TGF-beta has been implicated in the development of airway remodeling in asthma on the basis of its strong capacity to induce extracellular matrix production, it is possible that Smad7 also plays some roles in the regulation of the process.We sought to determine the relationships between Smad7 expression in bronchial biopsy samples from asthmatic subjects and clinicopathologic features.Bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained from 40 asthmatic subjects and 6 healthy control subjects. Expression levels of Smad7 on a histologic section were estimated by immunohistochemical staining. In addition, the roles of Smad7 in TGF-beta-mediated transcriptional responses were studied by in vitro studies.Smad7 immunoreactivity was detected mainly in bronchial epithelial cells in control and asthmatic subjects. Interestingly, asthmatic subjects exhibited less Smad7 immunoreactivity in bronchial epithelial cells than normal subjects. Expression levels of Smad7 in bronchial epithelial cells were inversely correlated with basement membrane thickness and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic subjects. In addition, abrogation of endogenous Smad7 expression through use of an antisense oligonucleotide enhanced transcriptional responses to TGF-beta, whereas overexpression of Smad7 inhibited TGF-beta-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor 1production in a human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS2B cells.These findings suggest that Smad7 is a key molecule that defines the susceptibility of bronchial epithelial cells to TGF-beta action and that regulation of Smad7 expression in bronchial epithelial cells might be related to the development of airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma.",

        "abstract": "To identify problems in early diagnosis of tuberculosis and to design countermeasures against the disease, we examined the status of active tuberculosis among patients admitted to a university hospital that did not have an isolation ward for tuberculosis. Between 2005 and 2007, we analyzed demographic characteristics, disease type, chest radiologic findings, and the process leading to diagnosis. Active tuberculosis was diagnosed after admission in 55 patients (34 males and 21 females): pulmonary tuberculosis, 26; tuberculous pleuritis, 13; tuberculous meningitis, 6; miliary tuberculosis, 4; tuberculous pericarditis, 3; lymph-node tuberculosis, 2; and tracheal and bronchial tuberculosis, 1. Although radiographic examinations provided abundant information, chest radiography showed normal findings in 7 patients (12.7%). Computed tomographic scanning was useful for detailed evaluation of abnormalities. Twenty patients (36.4%) were given diagnoses at departments other than ours (Department of Pulmonary Medicine). Numbers of days between hospital admission and diagnosis of tuberculosis (50th percentile/80th percentile) were 8.0/37.8 for miliary tuberculosis, 8.0/8.0 for tracheal and bronchial tuberculosis, 7.5/17.8 for tuberculous pleuritis, 7.0/8.8 for tuberculous pericarditis, 6.0/15.6 for pulmonary tuberculosis, 3.5/4.4 for lymph-node tuberculosis, and 1/1 for tuberculous meningitis. Early diagnosis of tuberculosis requires adherence to the following precautions. Tuberculosis should be suspected in any patient with respiratory symptoms. Sputum tests for acid-fast bacteria should be performed at least three times initially. If findings on chest X-ray films are equivocal, high-resolution computed tomography should be performed to confirm details of shadows and to detect minimal pulmonary shadows or cavitary lesions. Physicians from all specialties should be repeatedly informed about the risk of tuberculosis and should include tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients suspected to have pulmonary diseases.",

        "abstract": "Topical application of a glucocorticoid is now widely recognized as the first-line therapy for bronchial asthma. However, glucocorticoid treatment is largely ineffective in relation to overproduction of sputum and lung tissue remodeling.The purpose of the current study was to identify human mast cell (MC) products that are related to goblet cell hyperplasia.The FcepsilonRI-mediated gene expression profile of MCs was examined by using high-density oligonucleotide probe arrays and RT-PCR. Secretion of a protein, amphiregulin, by the MCs was measured by ELISA. Upregulation of mucin genes in NCI-H292 cells by amphiregulin was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. The expression levels of amphiregulin on histological sections obtained from 40 subjects with asthma and 6 healthy control subjects were estimated by immunohistochemical staining, and the correlation with the number of goblet cells was studied.Amphiregulin was secreted by human MCs after aggregation of FcepsilonRI, and its expression was not inhibited by a glucocorticoid (dexamethasone). Amphiregulin upregulated mucin gene expression in airway epithelial cells. Upregulation of amphiregulin expression was observed in MCs of patients with asthma, but not normal control subjects. Furthermore, upregulation of amphiregulin in MCs significantly correlated with the extent of goblet cell hyperplasia in the mucosa of patients with bronchial asthma.These results suggest that after exposure to antigens, human MCs may induce sputum production via release of amphiregulin. Therefore, amphiregulin may be a new target molecule for treatment of overproduction of sputum in bronchial asthma.",

However, its role in the pathogenesis of asthma remains unclear. PGD2-induced vasodilatation and increased permeability are well-known classical effects that may facilitate transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, and monocytes in allergic inflammation. These effects are initiated via a PGD2 receptor, D prostanoid receptor (DP), and are referred to as DP-mediated vasodilation-extravasation. Recently, novel functions of DP have been identified. Furthermore, a novel and different receptor of PGD2, CRTH2, has been discovered. To date, DP and CRTH2 have been shown to be major PGD(2)-related receptors that have pivotal roles in mediating allergic diseases by effects such as directly regulating the migration of inflammatory cells and controlling the production of cytokines and lipid mediators. Available evidence suggests that CRTH2 and DP may collaborate in allergic inflammation. This review focuses on the novel roles of DP and CRTH2 in the initiation and maintenance of allergy.",

LDEs are thought to be metabolically more activate than normal-density eosinophils (NDEs). Recent studies suggest that cytokine-induced eosinophil activation is associated with adhesion molecule expression. The activated state of LDEs may result from increased expression of adhesion molecules. This study compared the expression of eosinophil adhesion molecules on LDEs and NDEs from various diseases characterized by eosinophilia. Expression of very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), lymphocyte function-associated antigen-I (LFA-1) and macrophage antigen-1 (Mac-1) on eosinophils from patients with eosinophilia was increased compared with those from healthy subjects. Mac-1 expression on LDEs was higher than on NDEs. These results suggest that VLA-4 plays a role in selective migration of eosinophils into the inflammatory tissue, and that Mac-1 is associated with activation of eosinophils in eosinophilic diseases.",

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) production in lymphocytes after exposure to 10(-3) M salbutamol, predominantly a beta-2 receptor stimulant, was significantly less in asthmatic subjects than in normal subjects, while there was no significant difference in cyclic AMP response to 10(-3) M norepinephrine, predominantly a beta-1 receptor stimulant. Both drugs evoked the maximum response at 10(-3) M. The cyclic AMP response to salbutamol of 5 asthmatic subjects being treated with steroids was diminished significantly compared with that of 7 patients not treated with steroids; however, the response to norepinephrine was similar in both groups. The degree of the abnormality in the beta-2 receptor response seems to be related to the severity of the asthma.",

The transcriptional repressor BCL6 has emerged as a multifunctional regulator of lymphocyte differentiation and immune responses. BCL6-deficient (BCL6) mice display T helper type 2 (Th2)-type inflammation, which is caused by abnormality of both lymphoid cells and nonlymphoid cells. Thus, BCL6 apparently contributes to negative regulation of various central molecules such as cytokines, in particular Th2 cytokines, CC chemokines, and immunoglobulin E in allergic diseases.

Therefore, inhibition of the EGFR signal by an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) may prevent pulmonary fibrosis. However, there is a possibility that blocking the EGFR signal may inhibit epithelial cell repair, thereby exaggerating lung fibrosis.To investigate the effect of EGFR-TK inhibition on lung fibrosis.We looked at the effects of the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib (20, 90, 200 mg/kg) and AG1478 (12 mg/kg) on a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model in mice.Gefitinib prevented lung fibrosis at all three doses. Furthermore, in those mice that did not receive bleomycin treatment, gefitinib at 200 mg/kg did not induce lung fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that phosphorylation of EGFR in lung mesenchymal cells induced by bleomycin was inhibited by gefitinib. AG1478 also attenuated the lung fibrosis. In vitro studies further demonstrated that the addition of gefitinib or AG1478 suppressed the EGFR ligand-induced proliferation of lung fibroblasts.These findings suggest that, in the preclinical setting, EGFR-TKIs may have a protective effect on lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin. Because these molecular targeted drugs may have differing effects depending on species and individuals, a cautious interpretation is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Eosinophils accumulated in sites of allergic inflammation are thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, and tissue eosinophilia is attributable to increased eosinophil survival or decreased eosinophil apoptosis.Effects of the antiallergic, histamine H1 blocker oxatomide on viability and apoptosis of eosinophils isolated from the peripheral blood of atopic subjects were studied.Eosinophil viability and apoptosis were evaluated by using a colorimetric assay and annexin V-labeling, caspase-3 activity, and DNA fragmentation assay.The viability of eosinophils increased in the presence of IL-5 (10 ng/mL), confirming that IL-5 prolongs eosinophil survival in vitro. Application of oxatomide at concentrations over 20 micromol/L for 24 hours decreased the IL-5-induced enhancement of eosinophil viability. Double staining of the cells with annexin V and propidium iodide showed that deprivation of IL-5 promoted spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis and that oxatomide facilitated apoptosis and suppressed the prolongation of eosinophil survival stimulated by IL-5. In the absence of IL-5, approximately 71% and 96% of eosinophils after 24 and 48 hours, respectively, underwent spontaneous apoptosis. IL-5 decreased the rate of eosinophil apoptosis to 38% and 52% after 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Oxatomide increased eosinophil apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of IL-5. Furthermore, oxatomide increased caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation.We demonstrated that oxatomide possesses a novel therapeutic effect of apoptosis promotion on eosinophils and prevents the antiapoptotic effects of IL-5, suggesting that oxatomide may contribute to resolution of tissue eosinophilia in allergic inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Airway remodeling has an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. Many mediators that influence the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma, especially cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and TGF-beta1, are involved in airway remodeling.To know whether TGF-beta1 alters fibroblast responsiveness to CysLTs, we examined the effects of leukotriene (LT) D4 on collagen production from fibroblasts and from myofibroblasts transformed by TGF-beta1. We also examined whether TGF-beta1 upregulates CysLT1 receptor (CysLT1R) expression in fibroblasts.Concentrations of procollagen in the human fetal lung fibroblast (HFL) 1 cell supernatant were measured by using an enzyme immunoassay kit in the presence or absence of various concentrations of LTD4, TGF-beta1, CysLT1R antagonist, or some combination of these. The mRNA expression of CysLT1R and alpha-smooth muscle actin as a marker of myofibroblasts was measured by means of real-time PCR. Furthermore, protein expression of CysLT1R on fibroblasts was measured by means of flow cytometric analysis.TGF-beta1 stimulated collagen production from HFL-1 cells, but LTD4 alone did not. LTD4 in combination with TGF-beta1 increased collagen production compared with TGF-beta1 alone. Real-time PCR showed that stimulation with TGF-beta1 significantly upregulated CysLT1R and alpha-smooth muscle actin mRNA expression in HFL-1 cells.LTD4 increased collagen production by upregulating CysLT1R induced by TGF-beta1. In the TGF-beta-rich milieu, activated myofibroblasts expressing CysLT1R can respond to CysLTs and produce large amounts of extracellular matrix, thereby contributing to airway remodeling. These data suggest that treatment with leukotriene receptor antagonists might prevent airway remodeling in patients with asthma.",

        "abstract": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic disease, particularly bronchial asthma, by recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. In an effort to further elucidate this function of PAF, guinea-pig tracheal mucosa was cultured in the presence of PAF in vitro, and culture supernatants were injected intradermally into normal guinea-pigs. After 6 h, recruitment of the inflammatory cells in the tissue was evaluated as a marker of chemotactic activity. Neutrophil and eosinophil recruitment increased significantly 1 h after PAF stimulation, the latter more than the former. After fractionation of the culture supernatant using molecular sieve filters, the fraction of 10-30 kDa showed greater chemotactic activity than the fractions of below 10 kDA or greater than 30 kDA. This activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (over about 1-100 mg/ml) by treatment with anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibody. These results suggest that PAF induces the release of chemotactic factors for neutrophils and eosinophils from guinea-pig tracheal epithelial cells, and one of these factors may be GM-CSF.",

Major eosinophil-chemotactic factors released from mast cells are platelet activating factor and Leukotriene B4. In addition, T cells and bronchial epithelial cells produce eosinophil chemotactic cytokines. Cytokines including IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF, which are released mainly from CD4+ T cells and possibly Th2, activates eosinophils for migration, tissue damage, and survival. Adhesion molecules on eosinophils and constituent structures of the airway participate in the process of eosinophil migration. Among a variety of adhesion molecules, VLA-4 and VCAM-1 are unique to the interaction between eosinophils and endothelial cells. A major role of recruited eosinophils in the airway in asthma is considered to be damage to the bronchial epithelium caused by eosinophil specific granules proteins, in addition to production of lipid mediators, production of cytokines, antigen-presenting cell function, and possible induction of basement membrane thickening in the airway.",

Eosinophils cultured with secretory IgA for 3 and 12 h showed strong expression of mRNA for IL-8 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Exogenous IL-5 enhanced mRNA for IL-8 expression by eosinophils after 24 h of incubation. IL-8 secretion increased in a time-dependent manner throughout the 24 h of observation; in contrast, EDN release reached a plateau value after 12 h. Furthermore, at least 2 microM ionomycin was necessary for induction of IL-8 secretion, whereas 0.5 microM induced detectable EDN release by eosinophils. These results suggest that the mechanism of eosinophil degranulation may be different from those of cytokine secretion.",

However, the mechanism by which PGD 2 contributes to such reactions remains unclear. We established a novel experimental model of asthma that permitted direct assessment of the role of PGD 2 in airway inflammation. Antigen-sensitized mice were exposed to aerosolized prosta- glandin D 2 (PGD 2 ) 1 d before challenge with low-dose aerosolized antigen. Not only the numbers of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages but also the levels of IL-4 and IL-5 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were higher in PGD 2 -pretreated mice than in control mice. The expression of macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), a chemoattractant for Th2 cells, was greater in PGD 2 -pretreated mice than in control. Injection of anti-MDC antibody into PGD 2 -pretreated mice markedly inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration as well as Th2 cyto- kine production after antigen challenge. These results indicate that PGD 2 accelerates Th2 type inflammation by induction of MDC. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play a key role in the development of human asthma and that MDC might be a target molecule for ther- apeutic intervention.",

Eight years before presentation, bronchial asthma was diagnosed and the patient received inhaled corticosteroids plus antiasthmatic agents (a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist, leukotriene modifiers, and theophylline). Chest radiography showed small diffuse nodular shadows, and a computed tomographic scan showed thickening of the bronchi and bronchioles, with diffuse centrilobular nodules in both lung fields. A blood test and microscopic examination of the bronchoalveolar fluid revealed marked eosinophilia. Transbronchial lung biopsy and transbronchial biopsy showed eosinophilic bronchitis and bronchiolitis. After treatment with oral prednisolone (40 mg daily) and inhaled corticosteroids, the symptoms, blood eosinophilia, and radiographic findings improved. Recently, several similar cases of eosinophilic bronchiolitis have been reported. Studies of further cases and elucidation of the pathophysiology of eosinophilic bronchiolitis are necessary to establish a concept for this disease and to determine whether it should be classified as a subtype of bronchial asthma or as a distinct entity.",

        "abstract": "Asthma is characterized by an accumulation of activated eosinophils in the airway. Eosinophil viability-enhancing activity is present in the sputum of patients with asthma, largely because of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Bronchial epithelial cells have been shown to release cytokines including GM-CSF when stimulated with IL-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha.The study was designed to determine whether eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) stimulates the release of GM-CSF from bronchial epithelial cells.Epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were cultured in serum free HD-F12 medium in a 24-well tissue culture plate until they became confluent. The cells were then exposed to EPO (5.9 x 10(-8) to 5.9 x 10(-7) mol/L) for 15 minutes, washed twice, and cultured in 1 ml of HD-F12. The supernatants were harvested at 3, 6, or 24 hours, and GM-CSF concentration was measured by ELISA. BEAS-2B cells were also treated with a system comprising EPO (1.9 x 10(-9) to 5.9 x 10(-8) mol/L) + 10(-5) mol/L H2O2 + 10(-4) mol/L Br for 24 hours.The GM-CSF concentration in the supernatant pretreated with EPO increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner compared with control. The release of GM-CSF was not inhibited by catalase but was inhibited by cyclohexamide and by mixing of EPO with heparin, suggesting that the action is due to the cationic property of EPO. When EPO was combined with H2O2 and Br, 5.9 x 10(-9) mol/L EPO + 10(-5) mol/L H2O2 released two times more GM-CSF into the supernatants compared with control.These results suggest that EPO stimulates epithelial cells to release GM-CSF and forms a self-stimulatory cycle.",

        "abstract": "Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) play an important role in eosinophilic airway inflammation. In addition to their direct chemotactic effects on eosinophils, indirect effects have been reported. Eotaxin is a potent eosinophil-specific chemotactic factor produced mainly by fibroblasts. We investigated whether CysLTs augment eosinophilic inflammation via eotaxin production by fibroblasts. Leukotriene (LT)C(4) alone had no effect on eotaxin production by human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1). However, LTC(4) stimulated eotaxin production by IL-13-treated fibroblasts, thereby indirectly inducing eosinophil sequestration. Unstimulated fibroblasts did not respond to LTC(4), but coincubation or preincubation of fibroblasts with IL-13 altered the response to LTC(4). To examine the mechanism(s) involved, the expression of CysLT1R in HFL-1 was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Only low levels of CysLT1R mRNA and no CysLT1R protein were expressed in unstimulated HFL-1. In contrast, stimulation with IL-13 at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for 24 h significantly up-regulated both CysLT1R mRNA and protein expression in HFL-1. The synergistic effect of LTC(4) and IL-13 on eotaxin production was abolished by CysLT1R antagonists pranlukast and montelukast. These findings suggest that IL-13 up-regulates CysLT1R expression, which may contribute to the synergistic effect of LTC(4) and IL-13 on eotaxin production by lung fibroblasts. In the Th2 cytokine-rich milieu, such as that in bronchial asthma, CysLT1R expression on fibroblasts might be up-regulated, thereby allowing CysLTs to act effectively and increase eosinophilic inflammation.",

Lung membrane was first preincubated with 1-10 U/ml EPO and then incubated with 10(-4) M NaI and 10(-4) or 10(-6) M H2O2 for 2 hours. BAR density was determined using (-)125I-cyanopindolol. EPO combined with 10(-4) M H2O2 and I decreased the BAR density in a concentration-dependent manner. When only 10(-4) M H2O2 was used, the decrease in BAR density was small but significant. When compared to I, bromide was less effective and chloride alone was not effective. These results suggest that EPO is one of the factors responsible for beta-adrenergic blockade in asthma.",

Although little is known about its mechanism, recent in vitro observations suggest that the very late activation antigen-4 (VLA-4, CD49d/CD29) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) adhesion pathway may be involved in specific eosinophil migration. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of an anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) on the airway eosinophilia in a guinea pig model of asthma. Guinea pigs were sensitized by repeated inhalation of ovalbumin. After a single inhalation challenge, the animals showed a striking airway eosinophilia and late asthmatic response (LAR). In contrast, when guinea pigs were pretreated intravenously at 2 h before antigen challenge with a rat antimouse VLA-4 mAb, PS2/3, cross-reacting with guinea pig eosinophils and lymphocytes, eosinophil, basophil and lymphocyte infiltration in the tracheal wall was significantly inhibited as well as LAR in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that VLA-4 plays a critical role in antigen-induced airway eosinophilia and LAR.",

An animal model of local allergen (airways) sensitization was employed to study the effects of anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) on infiltration of eosinophils into inflammatory region, the development of antigen-induced late asthmatic response (LAR) and the increased bronchial responsiveness following LAR. Guinea pigs exposed to aerosolized ovalbumin (OVA) daily for 10 days developed an increase in the number of eosinophils in the tracheal wall 24 h after aerosolized OVA challenge. Furthermore, all animals developed an apparent LAR determined by the response with a 2-fold increase in respiratory resistance and showed an increase in bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine 24 h after OVA challenge. In animals treated with anti-IL-5 mAb, however, eosinophil number in the tracheal wall dramatically decreased compared with animals treated with control antibody. The development of LAR was also remarkably suppressed by anti-IL-5 mAb treatment, although a similar magnitude of immediate bronchoconstriction was observed. Moreover, in anti-IL-5 antibody-treated guinea pigs, an increase in bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine significantly decreased. Data demonstrate that IL-5 is involved in airway eosinophilia, development of LAR and an increase in bronchial responsiveness induced by allergen sensitization via the airways. Development of IL-5 synthesis inhibitors and/or receptor antagonists could provide another therapeutic class of anti-asthmatic drugs.",

The SIL-2R concentrations in patients with asthma irrespective of presence of acute attacks were significantly higher than those of the controls (p < 0.001). Although the sIL-2R concentrations were similar in the patients with acute asthma and those in remission, levels in patients with moderate and severe asthma attacks were significantly higher than levels for patients in remission (p < 0.001). These results suggest that T-lymphocyte activation occurs in asthma patients and becomes more prominent during moderate and severe acute attacks.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that allergic rhinitis is closely related to bronchial asthma, reflecting the \"one airway-one disease\" hypothesis. It is unclear if the effects of pranlukast, a leukotriene-receptor antagonist, are consistent with this hypothesis.The goal of the study was to determine if pranlukast has effects on the upper and lower airways through a comparison of the effects of fexofenadine and pranlukast on airway hyperresponsiveness in non-asthmatic patients with cedar pollinosis before the Japanese cedar pollen season and during the peak pollen season.Patients received fexofenadine hydrochloride plus oral mequitazine (fexofenadine group) or pranlukast hydrate plus oral mequitazine (pranlukast group) as an initial treatment. Subsequent changes in airway responsiveness to acetylcholine were measured.Among patients in whom coughing developed during the peak pollen season, airway responsiveness significantly increased in the fexofenadine group. In the pranlukast group, airway responsiveness did not increase significantly, regardless of the presence or absence of coughing.The results indicate that pranlukast hydrate inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness in non-asthmatic patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis. In turn, this suggests that cysteinyl leukotrienes have a role in increased airway responsiveness.",

We have reported that the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B can produce interleukin (IL)-16, a potent chemoattractant for CD4+ T cells. IL-16 is thought to regulate airway inflammation in asthmatics. Recent studies showed that IL-4 induces inflammatory cytokines in bronchial epithelial cells and that IL-9 is a candidate gene for development of asthma. The present study demonstrated that BEAS-2B cells produced specifically IL-16 by synergistic effects of IL-4 + IL-16, or IL-9 + IL-16, and that the synthesized IL-16 induced migration of CD4+ T cells. This study is a first report indicating that IL-16 production may be maintained by an autocrine machinery by epithelial cell-derived IL-16 with IL-4 and IL-9 in asthma.",

        "abstract": "Background: Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) has been suggested to play an important role in the development of airway remodeling in asthma; this suggestion is based on evidence that expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 are correlated with unique parameters of airway remodeling, such as thickness of basement membrane. However, the relevant studies were inconclusive because they were unable to demonstrate active signaling mediated by the cytokine in the airways of asthmatic individuals. Objective: We sought to determine whether TGF-\u03b2 signaling was active in the airways of asthmatic subjects and, if so, whether it was correlated with clinicopathologic features associated with the development of airway remodeling in asthma. Methods: We examined the phosphorylation status of Smad2 in bronchial biopsy samples obtained from 40 asthmatic subjects as a marker of active TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and we studied its correlation with basement membrane thickness. Results: Expression levels of phosphorylated Smad2 in bronchial biopsy specimens from asthmatic subjects were higher than those in specimens from normal subjects, and they were correlated with basement membrane thickness in asthma. Conclusion: The findings provide evidence that TGF-\u03b2 signaling was active in asthmatic airways and that the activity was associated with the development of airway remodeling in asthma.

In the early twentieth century, Plavec et al. reported that theophylline has a positive inotropic action on the myocardium.\n Since 1937, when Herrman et al. confirmed its effectiveness for asthma attacks, theophylline has been primarily considered\n a bronchodilator. In the 1970s and 1980s, theophylline was mainly used for the long-term management of asthma in the United\n States.\n \n Since the 1990s, the mainstay of treatment for asthma in the United States shifted to inhaled corticosteroids or inhaled corticosteroids\n plus long-acting inhaled \u03b2 2 agonists (LABAs). The clinical positioning of theophylline was thus negatively affected. Since\n the latter part of the 1990s, however, evidence has accumulated that theophylline inhibits the airway inflammation characteristically\n found in asthma and can be used with inhaled corticosteroids to treat asthma. In this paper, we describe the clinical significance\n of sustained-release theophylline for the long-term management of asthma.\n \n \n ",

Conditioned media (CM) prepared from patients' E rosette forming cells (ERFC) with or without IL-2 was assayed for CFU-Eo, CFU-monocyte, macrophage (CFU-M) and CFU-neutrophil (CFU-N) GSF. The addition of IL-2 to the ERFC significantly stimulated the production of CFU-Eo and CFU-M GSF while only CFU-M GSF increased in normals. Serial testing of the CFU-Eo GSF in ERFC-CM demonstrated that the ability of ERFC to produce CFU-Eo GSF with IL-2 stimulation was retained even when the eosinophilia had disappeared. These results suggest that CFU-Eo GSF is produced from T-cells with IL-2 stimulation and that the T-cells from patients produce IL-2 stimulation and that the T-cells from patients produce CFU-Eo GSF with IL-2 stimulation after the disappearance of eosinophilia.",

However, it remains unknown whether anti-PDGFRs antibody exists in collagen vascular diseases other than SSc. To answer the question, we developed an ELISA system and examined sera from patients with SLE (n = 75), SSc (n = 31), RA (n = 25) and control individuals. We also reviewed medical records to clarify clinical features of patients with anti-PDGFR\u03b1 antibody. To examine the functions of anti-PDGFR\u03b1 antibody in patients, fibroblasts were cultured and stimulated in the presence of purified IgG from patients, and their cell numbers were counted. Anti-PDGFR\u03b1 antibody was detected in 29% of patients with SLE and in 21% of patients with SSc. Anti-PDGFR\u03b1 antibody was found in 36% with active SLE, but in 10% in an inactive phase. Immunosuppressive therapy decreased the titer of the antibody. Patients with anti-PDGFR\u03b1 antibody frequently developed a rash and hematological abnormalities, particular hemolytic anemia. Moreover, anti-PDGFR\u03b1 antibody in SLE failed to demonstrate agonistic or antagonistic activities on PDGFR signaling. These findings indicate that nonfunctional anti-PDGFR\u03b1 autoantibody exists in patients with SLE as well as those with scleroderma, and that the antibody could be a marker of disease activity and may be a marker of a subgroup of SLE.",

In contrast, the guidelines followed in the west do not promote theophylline use due to safety concerns, and the use of injectable methylxanthines in particular are not recommended. We thus conducted a study on adult patients with bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with theophylline and injectable methylxanthines in Japan in order to assess the safety of these drugs.876 patients were surveyed at 55 medical institutions by the Committee on the Safety of Sustained-Release Theophylline and Injectable Methylxanthines (CST) of the Committee for Asthma Prevention and Management Guidelines of the Japanese Society of Allergology (JSA). 682 of the patients were evaluated for safety.Adverse reactions including facial flushing, palpitations, headache, tinnitus, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting and tachycardia were reported by only 2 (0.29%) of the 682 patients, but none of these were serious.The results confirm that injectable methylxanthines are safe, when used in accordance with the JGL.",

        "abstract": "Alveolar epithelial cells produce many types of chemokines such as regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES), eotaxin induced by interleukin (IL)-1 beta, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and may contribute to allergic disease by recruiting eosinophils. However, identification of the eosinophil chemotacic activity (ECA) release from A549 cells, an alveolar type II cell line, has not yet been completed. Recently, IL-16 was also reported to be a potent chemotactic stimulus for CD4(+) T lymphocytes and eosinophils in asthma and other pulmonary diseases. To test the possibility that alveolar epithelial cells produce IL-16, we analyzed RNA and culture supernatant from A549 cells by reverse transcription/ polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The release of ECA from A549 cells was assessed using a blind-well chemotactic chamber. IL-16 release was increased in a concentration-dependent manner by stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha. A549 cells also expressed IL-16 messenger RNA. The combination of IL-4 and IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha had an additive effect on IL-16 production. The release of ECA was induced by IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of these cytokines had a greater effect than one alone. The blockade of eotaxin and IL-16 caused 70% inhibition of ECA, but anti-RANTES antibodies only caused 30% inhibition and anti-IL-8 antibodies failed to affect inhibition. These findings suggest a role for chemokines released by alveolar epithelial cells in the recruitment of eosinophils into the lung in pulmonary disorders such as asthma and interstitial lung diseases, and suggested that eotaxin and IL-16 are potent and effective eosinophil chemoattractants.",

        "abstract": "Leucocytes, especially lymphocytes and neutrophils, as well as alveolar macrophages, that infiltrate into the lung are involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. However, the role of T helper (Th)2-type inflammation, mediated by Th2 cells and eosinophils, in fibrosis remains unknown. Transgenic mice deficient in the transcriptional repressor, Bcl6, display an attenuation of Th2 cytokine production. We studied the effects of Th2-type pulmonary inflammation on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis using Bcl6 transgenic mice.Bleomycin was administered to ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized Bcl6 transgenic and wild-type mice by intratracheal instillation during sequential OVA antigen challenge. Concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta1 in the BAL fluid were measured 2 weeks after bleomycin administration. At the same time lung tissue was examined histopathologically, and homogenized to assess collagen levels and Th1/Th2 cytokine mRNA expression.Although OVA-sensitized, bleomycin-treated Bcl6 transgenic mice had markedly lower numbers of eosinophils in both BAL and lung tissue compared with OVA-sensitized, bleomycin-treated wild-type mice, the development of pulmonary fibrosis in response to bleomycin was similar in Bcl6 transgenic mice and wild-type mice.These results suggest that Th2-dominant inflammation in the lung is not essential for the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",

Radioisotope-labeled probes, although sensitive, require autoradiographic detection, which is time-consuming. In the most recent study we attempted to detect IL-5 messenger RNA in the bronchial biopsy specimens from patients with asthma using nonradioactive in situ hybridization, which gives rapid results. Bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained from eight patients with asthma and seven diseased control subjects. IL-5 complementary DNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin-deoxyuridine triphosphate and hybridized to permeabilized sections. Hybridization signals were visualized by an immunohistochemistry technique. Positive hybridization signals were observed in six of the eight biopsy specimens from patients with asthma. Pretreatment with ribonuclease or hybridization with an unrelated probe produced negative results. Immunohistochemical staining of serial sections with a monoclonal antibody to IL-5 revealed that a few cells within the mucosa positively stained, suggesting active synthesis of IL-5. Biopsy results from the seven diseased control subjects did not show any hybridization signal. These results confirm and extend previous observations of IL-5 messenger RNA expression in the airways of patients with asthma, and suggest that digoxigenin-labeled IL-5 complementary DNA probes would be a powerful research tool.",

A 72-year-old woman with hypertension and diabetes, who did not smoke and did not have pets, consulted a physician with the chief complaints of cough, sputum, and slight fever. Chest X-ray films revealed a permeation shadow in the bilateral upper lobes. She visited a hospital because her symptoms did not improve. Pulmonary tuberculosis was suspected because of an elevated inflammatory reaction, and anti-tuberculosis treatment was started. Afterwards, eosinophilia appeared in the peripheral blood. Although daily drugs (nicardipine hydrochloride, pentoxifylline, and ticlopidine hydrochloride) were stopped, eosinophilia did not improve and was detected in a sputum sample. She was diagnosed with pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia syndrome and hospitalized. Physical examination revealed neither rhonchus nor cardiac murmurs on auscultation. Laboratory findings showed a leukocyte count of 21,300/microl, with eosinophils accounting for 66.3% of cells. A diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia was made after a lung biopsy specimen was examined under a bronchial fiberscope. After suspension of anti-tuberculosis drugs and administration of suplatast tosilate 300 mg/day for 4 weeks, symptoms subsided, eosinophilia improved to within normal ranges, eosinophils in sputum disappeared, and the permeation shadow disappeared on chest X-ray films.",

To further clarify the antiinflammatory machanism, we examined the ability of tranilast to counteract the prolongation of eosinophil survival induced by interleukin (IL)-5. Tranilast reduced the IL-5 prolonged survival of eosinophils at the concentration range of 30 microg/ml to 100 microg/ml. The DNA extracted from eosinophils cultured with tranilast showed signs of fragmentation that was comparable with apoptosis. Electron-microscopic analysis of activated eosinophils cultured with 100 microg/ml of tranilast also revealed morphologic features of apoptosis. These data suggest that tranilast may act in vivo on activated eosinophils to reduce inflammation in allergic diseases.",

        "abstract": "The helper (Th)2 cell-attracting chemokines thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) are ligands for the chemokine receptor CCR4. A number of cellular sources of TARC and MDC have been identified, including not only macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, but also bronchial epithelial cells. Recent studies report that TARC and MDC may serve as pivotal chemokines for the development of Th2-dominated experimental allergen-induced asthma. This study was designed to assess TARC and MDC production by CD4+ T cells, including naive T cells and memory/effector T cells, purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with asthma. Asthmatic subjects included in this study had mild asthmatic symptoms, positive skin test responses to house dust mite allergen, and elevated level of Dermatophagoides farinae immunoglobulin E in the sera. CD4+ T cells--CD45RA+ CD4+ T cells--as naive T cells and CD45RO+ CD4+ T cells--as memory/effector T cells--were purified by negative selection from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from asthmatic patients (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 6). These cells and established Th1/Th2 cell lines were then cultured in the presence of both anti-CD3 and -CD28 antibodies. After 48 hr of incubation, concentrations of TARC, MDC, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and interferon-gamma in the supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze mRNA expression of TARC and MDC. Our results clearly showed that TARC and MDC were produced by activated CD45RA+ CD4+ T cells rather than by activated CD45RO+ CD4+ T cells, and the levels of these chemokines in the asthmatic patients were higher than those in the healthy controls. Furthermore, these chemokines production by Th2 cell lines were greater than those by Th1 cell lines, but the level were smaller than those by naive T cells. Our studies suggest that TARC and MDC are produced by naive T cells rather than by memory/effector T cells, including Th2 cells, in asthmatic patients, and these chemokines were produced at modest levels in any T-cell populations from healthy controls. Taken together, naive T cells in asthma have a peculiar function to produce TRAC and MDC, which contribute to local migration of Th2 cells into lung and lymphoid tissues, along with a function as precursor for memory/effector T cell. This novel function of naive T cells may be implicated in the development of asthma.",

There were significant differences in serum levels in both ECP and IL-5 between symptomatic and asymptomatic asthma, and healthy subjects. A significant positive correlation was found between serum levels of ECP and IL-5. No significant correlation was found between %FEV1 and serum level of ECP or IL-5, however, when the analysis was restricted to patients of less than 60 years of age, the correlations were significant. These results suggest that IL-5 is one of the factors that activate eosinophils even in peripheral blood, and that measurement of serum levels of ECP and IL-5 is useful for in vitro monitoring of asthma.",

Therefore, a drug that may find a place as an adjunct to regular corticosteroid therapy, as\n a corticosteroid-sparing agent, or as an alternative to corticosteroids is needed.\n \n In this context, drugs, such as cyclosporin, that inhibit T-lymphocyte activity are receiving increasing attention since the\n hypothesis that activated T-lymphocytes play a central role in the pathogenesis of asthmatic airway inflammation has emerged.\n The results of recent clinical trials of cyclosporin provided a gleam of hope for the treatment of steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant\n asthma. However, it would be premature to consider the addition of this type of drug to the armamentarium of antiasthmatic\n drugs before the results of comparative studies to weigh the benefits against serious long-term side effects are obtained.\n Nonetheless, the data of those trials may encourage development of other, safer drugs that suppress T-lymphocyte function.\n \n \n ",

        "abstract": "The difference between allergen-induced asthma and exercise-induced asthma with respect to the late asthmatic response and airway responsiveness has not been well elucidated.We compared the incidence of late asthmatic response, the changes in airway responsiveness, the degree of epithelial desquamation, and the activation of eosinophils in the airways after induction of allergen-induced asthma and exercise-induced asthma.Allergen-induced asthma or exercise-induced asthma was provoked in asthmatic patients, and sputum was collected before challenge and at the immediate asthmatic response and the late asthmatic response. Clusters of columnar epithelial cells in sputum (Creola bodies) were detected to evaluate respiratory epithelial damage, and the sputum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) concentration was measured to evaluate eosinophil activation in the airways. Airway responsiveness was measured before and 48 hours after the challenge.The maximal % fall in FEV1 with the late asthmatic response was significantly higher after induction of allergen-induced asthma than after exercise-induced asthma, even though the maximal % fall in FEV1 with the immediate asthmatic response was similar. Airway responsiveness increased significantly at 48 hours after allergen-induced asthma, while it did not change after exercise-induced asthma. The increase in airway responsiveness was not correlated with the maximal % fall in FEV1 with the late asthmatic response, but was correlated with the degree of epithelial damage evaluated by observation of Creola bodies. The sputum ECP concentration and the percentage of sputum eosinophils increased significantly with the late asthmatic response after allergen-induced asthma, but did not change after exercise-induced asthma.We conclude that less airway inflammation was provoked by exercise-induced asthma resulting in less epithelial damage and no increase of airway responsiveness in contrast to allergen-induced asthma.",

        "abstract": "In atopic dermatitis (AD) there is evidence of tissue fibrosis involving a number of structural changes, including papillary dermal fibrosis and epidermal hyperplasia. These changes are suggested to be the result of chronic inflammation of the skin. Several remodeling-associated cytokines, including transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1, IL-11, and IL-17, have been shown to be increased in allergic diseases, including asthma.We investigated TGF-beta1, IL-11, and IL-17 expression in skin biopsy specimens recovered from acute and chronic skin lesions from patients with AD, as well as from uninvolved skin of patients with AD and skin from healthy volunteers. We also examined the correlation between the expression of these cytokines and the extent of total, type I, and type III collagen deposition.We evaluated the expression of TGF-beta1, IL-11, and IL-17 by means of immunohistochemistry. Collagen deposition was assessed by means of immunohistochemistry and van Gieson staining.TGF-beta1 expression was markedly enhanced in both acute and particularly chronic lesions (P <.001). Although IL-11 expression was significantly increased only in chronic lesions (P <.0001), IL-17 was preferentially associated with acute lesions (P <.005). Although collagen type III deposition was not significantly different among the groups, type I collagen deposition was significantly increased in chronic AD lesions (P <.0005). There was a significant correlation between IL-11 and type I collagen deposition, as well as the number of eosinophils in skin specimens from patients with AD (r (2) = 0.527, and r (2) = 0.622, respectively; P <.0001).These results suggest that TGF-beta1, IL-11, and IL-17 are involved in the remodeling of skin lesions in patients with AD. However, IL-11 and IL-17 are preferentially expressed at different stages of the disease. Type I collagen appeared to be the major subtype involved in this repair process.",

The MIC(90)/MIC(50) was 4/0.25, 2/0.125, 1/0.125, and 2/0.25 microg/mL for ciprofloxacin, 8/4, 8/4, 4/4, and 8/4 microg/mL for amikacin, 64/16, 64/16, 64/16, and 64/16 microg/mL for sulbactam/cefoperazone, 8/2, 16/2, 32/2, and 8/2 microg/mL for ceftazidime, indicating little change. The AUDs of fourth-generation cephalosporins increased from 2005 to 2008 (16.2, 18.4, 28.0, and 23.0), while the AUDs of carbapenems decreased (25.7, 23.7, 10.9, and 12.5).The decrease in the AUDs of carbapenems was associated with increased susceptibility rates of P. aeruginosa to carbapenem derivatives. A continuous understanding of trends in the resistance of P. aeruginosa and various other pathogens is essential for designing countermeasures against nosocomial infections, including the proper and effective use of antimicrobials.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoids have long been used as the most potent drugs in the treatment of bronchial asthma. Data reported recently have led to the proposal that theophylline and macrolides have antiinflammatory effects.We examined the abilities of theophylline, glucocorticoids, and macrolides to counteract the prolongation of eosinophil survival caused by IL-5.Purified guinea pig eosinophils were cultured in the presence or absence of human IL-5 and with or without the aforementioned drugs at various concentrations. The percentage of cells alive after 3 days in culture was determined.Aminophylline (AM), methylprednisolone (MP), erythromycin (EM), and clarithromycin (CAM) suppressed the IL-5 induced prolongation of eosinophil survival in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of these drugs on eosinophil survival were significantly greater at low concentrations of IL-5 than at high concentrations of IL-5. When eosinophils were cultured in the presence of IL-5 (1 ng/ml) with physiologic concentrations of MP (10(-6) mol/L), AM (10(-4) mol/L), and either EM or CAM (both 10 micrograms/ml), the effect of IL-5 was almost completely abolished, and the morphologic changes in eosinophils observed by electron microscopy were consistent with apoptosis. DNA extracted from eosinophils cultured with IL-5 and each of the drugs was definitely fragmented.One mechanism of the effectiveness of these drugs is induction of eosinophil apoptosis. Some combination of these drugs may be useful in the treatment of bronchial asthma.",

Complementary DNA libraries were formulated from both peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with mite antigens and those not stimulated with mite antigens and underwent subtraction and differential screening. The authors obtained 13 genes for which expression had increased because of mite antigens. Of these, nine were mitochondrial genes; two, h-satellite DNA III; one, factor XIII; and one, ferritin heavy subunit. As a result of polymerase chain reaction on both cDNA libraries, IL-5 genes were amplified only from the cDNA library that had been stimulated with mite antigens.",

        "abstract": "Preferential eosinophil accumulation is characteristic of airway inflammation in asthma. Although little is known about its mechanism, the effect of a sialyl Lewis X analog on airway eosinophilia was examined in a guinea-pig model of asthma. Guinea-pigs were sensitized by repeated inhalation of ovalbumin. After a single inhalation challenge, the animals showed striking airway eosinophilia and a late asthmatic response. In contrast, when guinea-pigs were pretreated intravenously with sialyl Lewis X analog (LX 0104) 1 h before antigen challenge, both eosinophil infiltration in the tracheal wall and the late asthmatic response were significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In a further in vitro study, LX 0104 significantly suppressed the adhesion of human and guinea-pig eosinophils to human umbilical vein endothelial cells activated with interleukin-1 beta. These results suggest that LX 0104 plays a critical role in antigen-induced airway eosinophilia and the late asthmatic response.",

        "abstract": "Transcriptional repressor B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) appears to regulate T2 immune responses in allergies, but its precise role is unclear. We previously reported that Bcl6 suppressed IL-4 production in na\u00efve CD4 T cell-derived memory T2 cells. To investigate Bcl6 function in allergic responses in naturally occurring memory phenotype CD4 T (MPT) cells and their derived T2 (MPT2) cells, -manipulated , highly conserved intron enhancer (hcIE)-deficient , and reporter mice for conserved noncoding sequence 2 (CNS2) 3' distal enhancer region were used to elucidate Bcl6 function in MPT cells. The molecular mechanisms of Bcl6-mediated T2 cytokine gene regulation were elucidated using cellular and molecular approaches. Bcl6 function in MPT cells was determined using adoptive transfer to na\u00efve mice, which were assessed for allergic airway inflammation. Bcl6 suppressed IL-4 production in MPT and MPT2 cells by suppressing CNS2 enhancer activity. Bcl6 downregulated  expression in MPT2 cells, but not MPT cells, by suppressing hcIE activity. The inhibitory functions of Bcl6 in MPT and MPT2 cells attenuated allergic responses. Bcl6 is a critical regulator of IL-4 production by MPT and MPT2 cells in T2 immune responses related to the pathogenesis of allergies.",

The dependence of pH values in the starting solution revealed that the process condition\n should be within the modest region with the optimum pH value around 6\u20137. The PL intensity increased with increasing the concentration\n of Eu(TTA)3phen initially, then it showed saturating tendency above 0.6\u00a0mol%. An improvement of reliability by the glass encapsulation\n was exemplified by monitoring the long-term PL intensity under constant UV irradiation. We consider that the glass network\n carefully prepared by sol\u2013gel process is effective for preventing free oxygen and water from attacking Eu(TTA)3phen molecule without loss of PL output.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope, photoluminescence (PL) and PL quantum yield (PL-QY) measurements have been performed for analyzing the relation between crystallographic and light emission characteristics. The PL-QY is determined by both the crystalline phase purity of the ZnVO phase defined by XRD patterns and the crystalline size. With optimizing the sintering condition at a slightly Zn-rich side, a pure ZnVO phase with enough large crystalline size was obtained with the PL-QY value of 52\u00a0%, which was higher than our previously obtained value by solid state reaction.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the conversion efficiency of a silicon-photovoltaic (PV) module, we investigated the combination with a wavelength conversion film (WCF), which consists of Eu chelate particles encapsulated by the sol\u2013gel derived silica glass. The photoluminescence (PL) excitation spectrum of Eu chelate shows that the violet light below 400 nm is effectively converted to the red emission at 613 nm. Since the PV cell has higher sensitivity at the red wavelength region compared to the violet region, Eu chelate is one of the suitable material for a WCF. The diameter of fabricated sol\u2013gel encapsulated Eu chelate was larger than the wavelength of irradiated sunlight, therefore, the transmittance of a WCF decreased with increasing the concentration of Eu chelate. The short circuit current ( J SC ) was increased by inserting the the WCF on the front side of Si-PV cell compared to the reference module (glass/ethylene vinyl acetate/WCF without Eu chelate/Si-PV cell/EVA/back-film), and the maximum increase of \u0394 J SC was 1.03 mA/cm 2 compared to the reference module. However, the maximum \u0394 J SC of fabricated module was almost same as the conventional Si-PV cell due to the refractive index mismatch of each layers. Keywords Silicon-photovoltaic cell Wavelength conversion film Eu chelate Sol\u2013gel process Photoluminescence 1 Introduction A silicon (Si)-photovoltaic (PV) module efficiently converts a sunlight to an electrical output, and has been already in practical use in all over the world. This is because that Si has many advantages against other photoconductive materials for PV cells, such as abundance in earth, non-toxicity and ease to encapsulate. Generally, a Si-PV cell has lower sensitivity at violet and infrared wavelength regions compared to the visible region [1\u20133] . One of the key technique to improve the spectral mismatch between the photocurrent spectrum of a Si-PV cell and the spectrum of a sunlight is the wavelength conversion film (WCF), which consists of the up-conversion phosphors [4\u20137] . The wavelength conversion efficiency of an up-conversion phosphor is not so high [8,9] , therefore, the enhancement effect to the conversion efficiency of a Si-PV module will be considered to be small. On the contrary, the photoluminescence (PL) at the visible light by the ultraviolet light excitation has high wavelength conversion efficiency compared to the up-conversion phosphor, and it enables to improve the Si-PV module performance. Eu chelate has considerable promise as a light-emitting material for a WCF due to the high PL quantum efficiency by the ultraviolet excitation. Though the typical transition of trivalent Eu ion generates red emission [10,11] , a concentration quenching of Eu ion limits the available total emission intensity. Eu chelate, such as Eu(TTA) 3 phen [TTA: thenoyltrifluoronacetone, phen: 1,10-phenanthroline], improves the absorption coefficient per each Eu ion, and reduces the concentration quenching due to the inter-molecular interaction [12] . Therefore, Eu chelate has much attention for several applications such as white light-emitting diode and an organic light-emitting diode [13] . In comparison with conventional inorganic phosphors, on the other hand, the robustness of organic molecules is lower due to the bond strength of molecules fundamentally. In previous papers, organic\u2013inorganic hybridized light-emitting devices were investigated to improve the device performance compared to the all organic device [14\u201316] . In addition, an encapsulation against ambient oxygen and water by sol\u2013gel derived inorganic materials is one of crucial technological issues for practical applications [17\u201320] . The sol\u2013gel process is of great interest and has been considered as an excellent candidate for the preparation of inorganic\u2013organic composite materials in recent years due to its practical advantages including a low-temperature reaction, the ability to control the final composition and the convenience for the formation of various shapes. The conventional sol\u2013gel method is based on hydrolysis and condensation of organoalkoxides as starting materials with the aid of catalyst, water and alcohol. Since the solution is homogeneous and the condition of such chemical synthesis is mild without the need for a high temperature process, it provides a versatile way to introduce Eu(TTA) 3 phen, thus fabricating inorganic\u2013organic hybridized functional materials. In this study, we investigated the PL and PL excitation (PLE) spectroscopic characteristics of Eu(TTA) 3 phen encapsulated by sol\u2013gel derived silica glasses. In order to estimate the dependence of sol\u2013gel encapsulated Eu chelate on the device performance, we measured the particle size of sol\u2013gel encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen and the transmittance of a WCF. We achieved the improvement in the short circuit current the Si-PV module by inserting the WCF with sol\u2013gel glass encapslated Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles. 2 Experimental At first, Eu(TTA) 3 phen was dissolved into N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) with stirring for 30 min at room temperature. And then, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), ethanol and distilled water were also mixed into another bottle. Both solutions were put together into a bottle and stirred for 30 min. The catalyst of NH 3 was added into the bottle to start the sol\u2013gel reaction. The mole ratio of TEOS:DMF:ethanol:distilled water:NH 3 :Eu(TTA) 3 phen was 1:4:4:4:0.01:0.05. After stirring for more than 5 h, flake-like precipitates were found, and then the reaction mixture was poured into Teflon tray to dry with 120 \u00b0C oven for more than 5 h. The dried material was broken with an agate mortar. The fabricated sol\u2013gel encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles were mixed into the high refractive acryl resin as the WCF. The acryl polymer was synthesized as follows. At first, toluene was poured into the separable flask equipped reflux condenser at 70 \u00b0C. Fluorene based acryl monomer and an initiator, 2,2\u2032-azeobisisobutyronitride, was dissolved into toluene, then the mixture was added drop-wise into the separable flask with taking for more than 30 min. The solution was stirred for 3\u20135 h until increasing the viscosity. After cooling down to the room temperature, two-functional acryl oligomer, multi-functional monomer and an initiator, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-buthylperoxy)hexane, were added to the flask to obtain a thermosetting polymer solution mixture. The mixture containing the sol\u2013gel glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen was dropped onto a transparent film, and was coated with an applicator adjusting the gap at 8 mil. And then, the coated film was dried at 120 \u00b0C for 10 min. The thickness of a fabricated film was typically 50 \u03bcm. Above-mentioned sol\u2013gel glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen was added to the thermosetting polymer solution mixture with varying the amount from 0 to 2 wt%. The structure of PV module was cover glass/ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA)/WCF/Si-PV cell/EVA/back-film, as shown in Fig. 1 . The lamination film was covered by a PV vacuum laminator on the top of a back-film. The lamination condition was 150 \u00b0C for 10 min in vacuum and 15 min in pressure of 0.1 MPa. PL and PLE spectra of WCF were measured by a luminance spectrometer (FluoroMax-3, Horiba Jovin Yvon). The wavelength of monitoring in PLE and that of excitation in PL were 613 and 400 nm, respectively. To investigate the influence of the process condition on the optical characteristics of Eu(TTA) 3 phen encapsulated by sol\u2013gel glass, the PL quantum yield of a WCF was measured by a luminance quantum yield measurement system (QEMS-2000, Systems Engineering Inc.), which consists of a calibrated integrated sphere and an exciting violet light source with the center wavelength of 365 nm. The PL quantum yield was determined as the photon number ratio of the PL to the absorption in the calibrated integrating system. In order to estimate the amount of scattering owing to Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles, the transmittance of the WCF was recorded by a haze mater (NDH-200, Nippon Denshoku). The diameter distribution of sol\u2013gel encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen dissolved in toluene was measured by a dynamic light scattering method by a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (LS 13 320, Beckman Coulter Inc.). PV characteristics were measured by a solar simulator (WACOM, WXS-155S-10, AM1.5G) with AM1.5 (1000 mW/m 2 ) and the I \u2013 V curve tracer (EKO, MP-160). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 2 shows PL and PLE spectra of Eu(TTA) 3 phen encapsulated by the sol\u2013gel derived silica glass. The luminous transition of Eu(TTA) 3 phen originates from 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F J ( J = 0, 1, 2, 3) in Eu 3+ [10,11] . The experimental result in Fig. 2 showed a distinct peak of 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition of 613 nm in the PL spectrum, resulting in the high color-purity as a red wavelength region. In addition, the PLE spectrum rapidly increased less than 400 nm region, and this result indicates that only the violet light is converted to the red emission. As a result, the visible light passes through the WCF with Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles, and it reaches the Si-PV cell without the optical loss. The Si-PV cell has little sensitivity at the violet wavelength region less than 400 nm [1] , therefore, the red emission due to the Eu(TTA) 3 phen suggests the assumption of the increase the device performance. In Fig. 3 , we show the PL quantum yield of the WCF with sol\u2013gel derived silica glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles as a function of the concentration in the high refractive acryl resin. The PL quantum yield increased with increasing the concentration of sol\u2013gel encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen, and the maximum PL quantum yield of 64% was achieved at the concentration of 15%. This result indicates that the acryl resin has absorption at the excitation wavelength of 365 nm, resulting in the high PL quantum yield at the high concentration. In all the concentrations, the PL quantum yield was over 20%, and the violet light is efficiently converted to the red emission. It is noted that the concentration quenching of Eu(TTA) 3 phen was not observed less than the concentration less than 16 wt%, implying a high total emission intensity from the WCF utilizing the large amount of sol\u2013gel glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen in the WCF, as shown in Fig. 3 . In addition, the WCF became clouded at the concentration over 16 wt%. Fig. 4 shows the straight and integrated transmittance of WCFs with different concentrations of sol\u2013gel glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen. A halogen lamp was used as a light source to measure the transmittance. Both straight and integrated transmittance decreased with increasing the concentration due to the Rayleigh scattering. In addition, we show the diameter distribution of sol\u2013gel encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen measured by a dynamic light scattering method in Fig. 5 . As is evident from Fig. 5 , the typical diameter of sol\u2013gel encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen was 48 \u03bcm, which is larger than the wavelength of incident light. Such a large particle size is considered to cause the decrease in the transmittance of a WCF with increasing the concentration of Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles. The long reaction time of sol\u2013gel process more than 5 h caused the large particle size in our experiment, therefore, the optimization of reaction time is necessary for further improvement in the transmittance against the visible light. 6 shows the improvement in the short circuit current (\u0394 J SC ) of a Si-PV module in combination with the WCF including different concentrations of sol\u2013gel glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles. Here, \u0394 J SC was calculated as the difference between J SC of Si-PV module with the WCF and J SC of Si-PV cell before encapsulating as the module structure. In addition, \u0394 J SC of reference module at the concentration of 0% was defined as 0, and the concentration dependence of \u0394 J SC was calculated as the difference in \u0394 J SC between 0 and each concentrations to compare the reference module without sol\u2013gel glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles. It is note that \u0394 J SC increased with increasing the concentration of sol\u2013gel encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen up to 2%, and the maximum increase of \u0394 J SC was 1.03 mA/cm 2 compared to the reference module. Since the PL quantum yield increased with increasing the concentration, as shown in Fig. 3 , the total emission intensity of the WCF linearly increases with increasing the concentration of Eu(TTA) 3 phen. Therefore, the experimental result in Fig. 6 offers evidence that the improvement of \u0394 J SC was caused by the increase in the total emission intensity from the Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles. On the contrary, \u0394 J SC tended to decrease at the high concentration region. The transmittance of the WCF decreased with increasing the concentration of Eu chelate, as shown in Fig. 4 , owing to the large particle size. In a viewpoint of the transmittance of a WCF, the high transmittance due to the low concentration is required, however, the high concentration in Eu(TTA) 3 phen generates strong red emission, resulting in the high module performance. The maximum \u0394 J SC of fabricated module was almost same as the conventional Si-PV cell. The possible reason of this experimental result is that the refractive index mismatch of each layers, and the incident light is reflected at the interface between the high and low refractive index layers. As a result, a part of incident light cannot reach the Si-PV cell. The WCF was consisted of the acryl layer on a polyehylene terephthalate (PET) film with a high refractive index of 1.6. The decrease of \u0394 J SC of reference module by inserting only the acryl layer on the PET film was approximately 1 mA 2 . This result indicates that 4% of the incident light was not used for the optical\u2013electrical conversion in the Si-PV cell due to the reflection at the interface of each layer. If the scattering loss owing to the Eu chelate is ignored, \u0394 J SC is considered to increase with increasing the concentration of sol\u2013gel glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen. We can achieve the increase in \u0394 J SC of 5 mA/cm 2 at the concentration of 10 wt%. However, it is difficult to realize due to the aggregation of Eu chelate. 4 Conclusion We demonstrated the Si-PV module in combination with the WCF including the sol\u2013gel glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen, which has the high luminance red emission with the near violet excitation. The \u0394 J SC increased constantly with increasing Eu(TTA) 3 phen, and it decreased over 2 wt% owing to the scattering of Eu(TTA) 3 phen particles. Since the physical size of sol\u2013gel glass encapsulated Eu(TTA) 3 phen was approximately 48 \u03bcm, the large scattering loss caused the decrease in \u0394 J SC at the high concentration region. However, the \u0394 J SC of all the modules were lower than the conventional module owing to the refractive index mismatch of each layers. The use of acryl resin with low absorption coefficient at the excited light and the optimized device structure is one of the useful way for further improvement in the efficiency of the Si-PV module.

        "abstract": "We have studied trap centers and nonradiative (NRR) recombination centers in a Ba3Si6O12N2:Eu2+ (BSON), one of promising materials for efficient and stable phosphors in white LED lamp applications. The energy distribution of four trap centers was obtained by thermo-luminescence (TL) with the excitation energy of 5.59eV. By superposing a below-gap excitation light of 1.77eV and observing the intensity change of the 5d-4f emission of Eu2+ centered at 2.36eV in our two-wavelength excited photoluminescence (TWEPL) measurement, both transient and steady state enhancement were observed. Such peculiar behavior of photo-stimulation is attributed to the coexistence of trap centers and NRR centers: the photoexcitation of electrons from trap centers generates the transient component, while that from NRR centers maintains the steady state component. An optical detection of relatively faint contribution of defects became possible in order to improve further the reliability and efficiency of phosphor materials.",

The crystallinity parameter and the ordering domain were estimated from Raman and optical absorption spectra, respectively. As a result, they were improved with decreasing the off time of pulse voltage, corresponding to the slow evaporation speed of solvent. In addition, both the space-charge limited current mobility and the photoconversion efficiency showed same trend. A highest photoconversion efficiency of 1.11 % was achieved without the thermal annealing process after depositing the active layer.",

The relative photoluminescence intensities after the UV irradiation for 90\u00a0min were 88, 76, and 67% for nano-particles in the sol-gel derived glass film, powders in the sol-gel derived glass film, and raw powders, respectively.

By using highly chlorinated metal phthalocyanine as the building block and potassium as the coupling reagent, phthalocyanine-based carbon materials (PBCMs) containing transition metals were obtained. Our experiments demonstrate the structure of these PBCMs consists of transition metals embedded in graphitic carbon that includes a square planar MN4 magnetic core and the Fe and Co-PBCM possess spontaneous magnetization at room temperature. In addition, carbon-coated transition metal particles were obtained by the Wurtz-type reaction with excess amount of potassium coupling agent. The large transition metal surface area and magnetization of these M-PBCMs are useful for spintronic and catalytic applications.",

        "title": "Effect of annealing-induced oxidation of molybdenum oxide on organic photovoltaic device performance",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Molybdenum oxide (MoO  x  ) has been widely used as a hole transport layer in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), whose performance can be improved by inserting a MoO  x   layer between an organic active layer and a transparent anode because of efficient carrier dissociation. In this study, the influence of thermally annealed MoO  x   on the photovoltaic performance of OPVs was first investigated using low-bandgap polymer and [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 71 BM) blend films as the active layer. We used three low-bandgap polymers: poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4 H -cyclopenta[2,1- b ;3,4- b \u2032]dithiophene)- alt -4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), poly(4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2- b :4,5- b \u2032]dithiophene-2,6-diyl3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl) (PTB7), and poly([2,6\u2032-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b,3,3-b]dithiophene]3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl) (PTB7-Th). Power conversion efficiencies were drastically increased for all investigated polymers when the as-deposited MoO  x   layer was annealed at 160\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. In particular, a high efficiency of 6.57% was achieved when PTB7 was used; for comparison, the efficiency of a reference device with an as-deposited MoO  x   layer (not subjected to annealing) was 1.40%. Specifically, the short-circuit current density and fill factor were remarkably improved after annealing, which means that efficient carrier dissociation was achieved in the active layer. We evaluated optical absorption and surface morphology to elucidate reasons behind the improved photovoltaic performance, and these parameters only slightly changed after annealing. In contrast, angle-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the MoO  x   layer was oxidized after annealing. In general, the oxygen vacancies of MoO  x   act as carrier traps; a reduction in the number of carrier traps causes high hole mobility in the organic layer, which, in turn, results in an improved photovoltaic performance. Therefore, our results indicate that the annealing-induced oxidation of MoO  x   is useful for achieving high photovoltaic performance.",

In these compounds, each pymca ligand connects to two  M  2+  ions, forming a honeycomb network in the  ab  plane. The temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibilities in these compounds show broad maxima, indicating antiferromagnetic interactions within two-dimensional honeycomb layers. We also observed an antiferromagnetic phase transition at low temperatures by magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements. From the crystal structures and magnetic properties, we conclude that the compounds 1, 2, and 3 are good realizations of honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnets.",

We have studied carrier recombination (CR) processes in p-type 4H-SiC substrate by our optical scheme of two wavelength excited photoluminescence (TWEPL) at 12K. The Donor acceptor pair (DAP) photo-luminescence (PL) decreased distinctly with the addition of the below gap excitation (BGE) light, which revealed the presence of CR levels whose energy location corresponds to the BGE photon energy of 0.98 eV. Its dependence on the BGE power density together with the difference obtained by the BGE energy of 1.17 eV revealed a distribution of CR levels inside the forbidden gap of SiC. The method is free from electrical contact and is applicable to whole wafer mapping.",

We have studied carrier recombination processes via the IB in GaPN with N concentration of 0.56% by two wavelength excited photoluminescence (TWEPL) measurement. Spectral behavior of high energy shoulder in the IB luminescence with increasing the density of below gap excitation (BGE) light (hv BGE  =1.17eV) discriminated the effect of optical excitation from that of thermal activation.

The intensity of DAP and the YL decreased while it increased for I OX  after irradiation of the BGE. The intensity change in PL after addition of the BGE implies the presence of defect levels in the energy position corresponding to the photon energy of the BGE. Possible recombination models are listed and examined. Only the recombination model in which the YL corresponds to the transition from a shallow donor to a deep state at about 1\u00a0eV above the valence band maximum satisfies our experimental result.

        "abstract": "Though the crystal growth technology of SiC is improving steadily, it is still crucial to reduce crystalline defects which act as carrier recombination (CR) centers and deteriorate device performance. We detected CR centers in a p-type 4H-SiC substrate by observing the intensity change of photoluminescence due to the addition of a below-gap excitation (BGE) light of 0.93 eV. We noticed the temperature and the BGE density dependence of band edge (BE) emission in addition to donor acceptor pair (DAP) emission and discriminated the temperature effect from that of BGE. The BGE density dependence of the PL intensity quenching is different among the BE emission, B 0 - and C 0 -lines of the DAP, respectively. It gives us an important clue for understanding CR mechanisms inside the bandgap of SiC.",

By using a soft chemical exfoliation technique, exfoliated \u03b1-Co hydroxide nanosheets, typically with lateral dimensions of few 100\u00a0nm, were obtained in a colloidal suspension. The magnetic responses of a sample consisting of a colloidal suspension of the nanosheets indicates a ferromagnetic phase transition occurs at  T  C =37.8\u00a0K. The magnetization possesses a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures below  T  C . In addition to this observation, the magnetization is proportional to (1- T / T  C )  \u03b2   with  \u03b2 =0.8\u00b10.1 near  T  C,  which imply that the surface magnetism dominates in the exfoliated \u03b1-Co hydroxide nanosheets.",

The change in PL intensity as a function of the photon number density of below-gap excitation is examined for both bands, which enables us to determine the distribution of NRR centers inside the GaAs:N \u03b4-doped SL and GaAs layers. We propose recombination models to explain the experimental results.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Because co-deposition method has been utilized in a conventional thermal evaporation process to realize graded donor-acceptor architectures, we investigated an alternative intermittent electrospray co-deposition method for solution-processed organic photovoltaic cells. In this method, two solutions of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and phenyl-C 61  butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were alternatively deposited using high-voltage pulse. Thus, the P3HT:PCBM blend thin film could be deposited even in a vacuum-free experimental setup. The optimum pulse width was found to be greater than 6\u00a0s to avoid an unexpected charge to the adjacent glass capillary, which causes the instable electrospray. The P3HT molecular ordering estimated from Raman spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction patterns was comparable to that estimated from the spin-coated device. In addition, the P3HT:PCBM ratio of the deposited thin film could be controlled by changing the ratio of the pulse width for the P3HT and PCBM solutions and was evaluated from the ultraviolet\u2013visible absorption spectrum. Finally, a two layered bulk heterojunction structure with P3HT:PCBM was successfully demonstrated, leading to a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 3.1%. This value was 1.4-fold higher than that of the uniformly mixed bulk heterojunction device because of the high carrier-collection efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) is one of the most popular donor polymers for organic photovoltaic cells; however, annealing-induced molecular ordering is necessary for realizing high photoconversion efficiency. In this study, the ratio of ordered-disordered P3HT Raman signals was calculated as the crystallinity parameter, which can be evaluated as the molecular ordering of P3HT. In the case of spin-coated devices, the crystallinity parameter increases with increasing annealing temperature, and this agrees with the photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, the direct molecular ordering of P3HT during electrospray deposition is reported, detailing the relation between the solvent evaporation time and the crystallinity of P3HT, and is evaluated by Raman spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. To observe the solvent evaporation phenomena of the electropsray process, in situ measurement of solvent evaporation time was also successfully realized for the first time by placing a CCD camera below the substrate in electrospray deposition. The solvent evaporation time was controlled from 0.036 to 2.8\u00a0s by changing the applied voltage and solvent. By investigating the relationship between the solvent evaporation time and the molecular ordering of P3HT, the long solvent evaporation time caused the high crystallinity of P3HT. In addition, the population of P3HT crystallinity with an edge-on orientation also increased with increasing solvent evaporation time by evaluating the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction pattern, in good agreement with the estimated crystallinity from Raman spectroscopy. Finally, a photoconversion efficiency of 2.0% was achieved by electrospray deposition without post thermal annealing.",

In this research, a highly efficient organic photovoltaic cell was successfully demonstrated by the electrospray deposition method using a non-halogenated solvent, o-xylene. An addition of acetonitrile and 1,8-diiodooctane drastically reduced domain size of the organic active layer, resulting in improved device performance. In addition, the photoconversion efficiency was continuously increased with increasing the solvent evaporation time of a droplet deposited on a substrate, and the highest photoconversion efficiency of 5.6% was achieved by optimizing the solvent evaporation time.Current-density\u2013voltage characteristics under irradiation with AM 1.5 light and corresponding AFM images of the active layers electrosprayed with and without the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane in o-xylene and acetonitrile.",

        "abstract": "We have studied trap centers and nonradiative (NRR) recombination centers in a Ba3Si6O12N2:Eu2+ (BSON), one of promising materials for efficient and stable phosphors in white LED lamp applications. The energy distribution of four trap centers was obtained by thermo-luminescence (TL) with the excitation energy of 5.59eV. By superposing a below-gap excitation light of 1.77eV and observing the intensity change of the 5d-4f emission of Eu2+ centered at 2.36eV in our two-wavelength excited photoluminescence (TWEPL) measurement, both transient and steady state enhancement were observed. Such peculiar behavior of photo-stimulation is attributed to the coexistence of trap centers and NRR centers: the photoexcitation of electrons from trap centers generates the transient component, while that from NRR centers maintains the steady state component. An optical detection of relatively faint contribution of defects became possible in order to improve further the reliability and efficiency of phosphor materials.",

These arrays are further perpendicularly bridged by SBA ligand to construct a three-dimensional framework. Its magnetic properties have been investigated, and ferromagnetic interactions within the arrays have been found. From heat capacity measurements, we have found that this compound exhibits a three-dimensional ferromagnetic phase transition at  T  C \u202f=\u202f1.54\u202fK, and the specific heat just above  T  C  shows a Schottky anomaly which originates from an energy gap caused by uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. These results suggest that [Co 3 (SBA) 2 (OH) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ]  n   consists of weakly coupled 1D ferromagnetic Ising arrays.",

        "abstract": "We present the synthesis protocol of a red emissive InP/ZnS quantum dot with a 1-dodecanthiol ligand and its application to a quantum dot light-emitting diode. The ligand change from oleylamine to 1-dodecanthiol, which were connected around the InP/ZnS quantum dot, was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The absorption peak was blue-shifted by changing 1-dodecanthiol ligands from oleylamine ligands to prevent the unexpected nucleation of the InP core. In addition, the luminance of the light-emitting device was improved by using the InP/ZnS quantum dot with 1-dodecanthiol ligands, and the maximum current efficiency of 7.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 cd/A was achieved. The 1-dodecanthiol ligand is often used for capping to reduce the number of surface defects and/or prevent unexpected core growth, resulting in reduced Auger recombination. This result indicates that 1-dodecanthiol ligands prevent the deactivation of excitons while injecting carriers by applying a voltage, resulting in a high luminance efficiency.",

        "abstract": "A reprecipitation method has been investigated for fabricating colloidal nanoparticles using Eu-complex. Herein, we investigated optical degradation characteristics of (1,10-phenanthroline)tris [4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedionato]europium(III) colloidal nanoparticles, which were embedded into a silica glass film fabricated by a conventional sol-gel process. At first, we tried several types of good solvents for the reprecipitation method, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is found to be a suitable solvent for realizing the small diameter and the high long-term stability against the ultraviolet irradiation even though the boing point of DMSO is higher than that of water used as a poor solvent. By optimizing the good solvent and the concentration of Eu-complex, the relative photoluminescence intensity of 0.96 was achieved even though the ultraviolet light was continuously irradiated for 90 min. In addition, the average diameter of 106 nm was achieved when DMSO was used as a good solvent, resulting in the high transmittance at a visible wavelength region. Therefore, we can achieve the transparent emissive thin film with a center wavelength of 612 nm, and the optical degradation was drastically reduced by forming nanoparticles.",

In this study, wefabricated normal OPVs and investigated the reason of an improvedoptical-to-electrical conversion efficiency by annealing the MoOx layer. The photoconversion efficiency was improved up to 5.65% from 2.05% afterannealing at 160\u00b0C for 5 min, and the external quantum efficiency alsoincreased for all the measurement wavelength ranging from 300 to 900 nm. Especially, the short circuitcurrent density increased among photovoltaic parameters. The carrier transportresistance of photoactive layer was found to be reduced by evaluating theimpedance measurement. These results indicate that defects at the MoOx/organicinterface were successfully reduced by the thermal annealing process of MoOx layer. The efficient carrier transport was realized for the annealed-device,resulting in the high device performance. In addition, the relaxation andelectron recombination times were also reduced by the annealing process, whichlead to the improved photovoltaic performance.",

        "abstract": "An electrospray deposition (ESD) is a solution process, which has several advantages, such as the utilization of low concentration solution, the large device area using a continuous roll-to-roll process, and the simple setup without vacuum condition. By applying a high voltage to a solution, mists are generated from a tip of glass capillary, leading to the formation of organic thin film. Halogenated solvents are often used, but the amount of solvent should be reduced from the environmental aspect. Thus, by using the ESD and the non-halogenated solvent, the manufacturing process is friendly to environment. In this research, by measuring current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics and atomic force microscope (AFM) images, we evaluated OPV characteristics and root mean square (RMS) roughness of devices fabricated using the non-halogenated solvent. By adding 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), the photo conversion efficiency (PCE) was drastically improved, and the PCE of 5.45% was achieved.",

Control of film morphology at the microscopic scale is critical if spray-coated devices are to achieve high performance. Here we investigate electrospray deposition protocols for the fabrication of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) thin films with a single additive system under ambient conditions at room temperature. Critical deposition parameters including solution composition, applied voltage, and relative humidity are discussed systematically.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Spray coating, in competition with conventional spin coating, has attracted extensive attention among large-scale solution casting techniques for producing high-performance organic solar cell (OSC) devices. Solution-processed vanadium oxide (VO  x  ) is used extensively as an anode interlayer (AIL) in OSCs because of its unique optical and electronic properties. In this study, we optimized VO  x   AILs prepared using electrospray deposition (ESD-VO  x  ) and compared them with AILs prepared using spin coating (SC-VO  x  ); various ESD-VO  x   properties were found to be optimized at a flow rate of 6.25\u202f\u03bcL/min. The OSC active layer used was poly(4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-bu0027]dithiophene-2,6-diyl3- fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-bthiophenediyl): [6,6]phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC 71 BM). The ESD-VO  x   devices had transmittance and surface morphology comparable to SC-VO  x   interlayers used in high-efficiency OSC devices. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the obtained ESD-VO  x   surfaces had a favorable chemical composition. Measurement of hole mobilities using the space charge limited current method showed values of 4.36\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 \u22124  and 1.39\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 \u22124 \u202fcm 2 \u202fV \u22121 \u202fs \u22121  for ESD- and SC-VO  x  , respectively. The charge transport resistance, measured by impedance spectroscopy, was very low for ESD-VO  x   devices, indicating that there faster charge transportation occurs within these devices because of enhanced hole mobility. These data are consistent with the carrier lifetimes of 1.59\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 \u22128  and 4.53\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 \u22124 \u202fs for ESD- and SC-VO  x  , respectively. The enhanced charge transportation properties, which can reduce charge recombination, can be attributed to the advantageous surface and interfacial properties of ESD-VO  x   AILs. Results indicate that optimized ESD had unperturbed diode characteristics with an improved power conversion efficiency, compared to spin coated VO  x  , of 7.61%.",

Thus, the P3HT:PCBM blend thin film can be deposited even though a vacuum free experimental setup. The optimized pulse width was found to be u003e 6 s to avoid unexpected charge to the adjacent glass capillary, which cases the instable electrospray. The P3HT:PCBM ratio of deposited thin film can be controlled by changing the ratio of pulse width for P3HT and PCBM solutions. Finally, a vertically graded bulk heterojunction structure with P3HT:PCBM was successfully demonstrated, leading to a maximum photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.1%. This value was 1.4-fold compared to the uniformly blended device due to the high carrier collection efficiency.",

Previous studies on the electrospray process have mainly focused on novel device structure owing to its unique characteristic of small droplet size, which is less than 1\u00a0 \u03bc m. However, in this research, we investigated the spontaneous formation of interpenetrating continuous networks of the donor- and acceptor-rich domains of solvent evaporation during the electrospray process. By evaluating the ultraviolet\u2013visible absorption spectrum, Raman spectroscopy, and direction of polymer ordering, it was shown that the polymer-stacking condition was not influenced by solvent evaporation time, even though poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) along the face-on direction was well stacked under the slow solvent evaporation condition. In contrast, the crystallite size, which was estimated from the full width at half maximum X-ray diffraction pattern, increased as the solvent evaporation time increased. This means that the crystalline grain spontaneously grew in the droplet and that the large crystalline grain was formed during the slow evaporation condition. Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance trend was the same as the performance trend of the crystallite size and were increased with increasing solvent evaporation time for both polymers. Therefore, the crystalline grain size was a dominant factor in determining the photovoltaic performance. Additionally, the crystalline grain size could be controlled by the solvent evaporation time. Finally, by optimizing the active-layer thickness, the highest photoconversion efficiency of 8.6% was achieved. This is the highest value of an electrospray-based device. These results indicate that the solvent evaporation time is an important factor in determining the crystallite size of an organic thin film, which directly affects the photoconversion efficiency of OPVs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to realize high performance of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), it is indispensable to optimize device structures according to composing materials. In particular, the optical density distribution in stacked layers is one of important factors to enhance the optical absorption within the photoactive layer, resulting in the improved photoconversion efficiency. In this study, we optimized the film thickness of the photoactive layer as a fundamental way to control the optical density distribution. The influence of the photoactive layer thickness on photovoltaic performances of OPVs was first investigated using, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b\u2032]dithiophene-2,6diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-uorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] and [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester blend films in normal and inverted OPV structures, respectively. The short circuit current density (J  sc  ) showed a peak at the thickness at around 100\u2013120\u00a0nm and 80\u2013100\u00a0nm in normal and inverted OPVs, respectively. In addition, J  sc   of inverted OPVs were higher than those of normal OPVs for all the thicknesses. The FF decreased continuously with increasing the thickness in both device structures. The fill factor of normal OPV decreased with increasing thickness more slowly than that of the inverted OPV at the thickness of over than 200\u00a0nm. Furthermore, we simulated the optical density distribution in the stacked layers using the algorithm utilized matrix formulas based on Abelesu0027s formulas. The simulated optical intensity distribution as a function of the position and the wavelength is in a good agreement with the experimental spectra of external quantum efficiency. The result indicates a close correspondence between the optical density distribution and the photovoltaic performance. At the optimum photoactive layer thickness of 116\u00a0nm in the normal and 76\u00a0nm in the inverted OPVs, we obtained the highest PCEs of 9.25 and 10.4%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Despite great increases in photovoltaic performance due to the insertion of ligand-exchanged PbS quantum dot layer via 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), detailed carrier transport characteristics of solar cells with solution-phase ligand-exchanged PbS quantum dot (QD) still remains unknown. In this paper, relaxation time, recombination resistance, chemical capacitance, carrier lifetime, carrier diffusion length, and defect density corresponding to the depletion width were measured through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using the Schottky diode model to understand limiting factors for photovoltaic performance. The activation energy, which is estimated from the temperature-dependence of resistance, was reduced from 0.06\u202feV to 0.02\u202feV by inserting the PbS-EDT layer, leading to the improved photovoltaic performance. We also evaluated QD solar cells with varying thicknesses of PbS QD layers to investigate the impedance analysis and photovoltaic measurements. The depletion width as well as the carrier diffusion length was larger than the physical thickness of the layer, and this indicates that an increased short-circuit current density can be realized at the thick PbS QD layer due to the resulting large absorbance. Furthermore, the reduced trap density of the QD layer improves the open circuit voltage and fill factor. As a result, a high photoconversion efficiency of 9.41% was achieved.",

In this study, we investigated the resistance and capacitance components at the ZnO/PbS-QD interface and inside a PbS-QD layer by measuring the impedance spectrum while the interface area was controlled by changing the ZnO nanowire length. By evaluating the dependence of optical intensity and DC bias voltage on the ZnO nanowire length, only the capacitance was observed to be influenced by the interface area, and this indicates that photoinduced carriers are generated at the surface of PbS-QD. In addition, since the capacitance is proportional to the surface area of the QD, the interface area can be evaluated from the capacitance. Finally, photovoltaic performance was observed to increase with increasing ZnO nanowire length owing to the large interface area, and this result is in good agreement with the capacitance measurement.",

For further developments in this field, it is essential to understand the molecular conformation of the QD-antibody conjugates at the single-molecule scale. Here, we report on the direct imaging of QD-antibody conjugates at the single-molecule scale by using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Owing to the high spatiotemporal resolution of HS-AFM, we observed the dynamic splitting of individual antibodies during the conjugation process. QD-antibody conjugates were also clearly visualized at the single-molecule scale details. Several important features were even discovered through dynamic observation of the QD-antibody conjugates. We observed an intermediate state of conjugation, where the antibodies attached and detached to QDs repeatedly. We also revealed that the attached antibodies were not steady but drastically fluctuated in their recognition areas due to the Brownian motion. We also demonstrated that HS-AFM observation is useful for the quantitative analysis of fabricated conjugates.",

        "abstract": "An approach similar to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with the advantage of saving time and effort but exhibiting high performance, was developed using orientation-directed half-part antibodies immobilized on CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. ELISA is a widely accepted assay used to detect the presence of a target substance. However, it takes time to quantify the target with specificity and sensitivity owing to signal amplification. In this study, CdSe/ZnS quantum dots are introduced as bright and photobleaching-tolerant fluorescent materials. Since hydrophilic surface coating of quantum dots rendered biocompatibility and functional groups for chemical reactions, the quantum dots were modified with half-sized antibodies after partial reduction. The half-sized antibody could be bound to a quantum dot through a unique thiol site to properly display the recognition domain for the core process of ELISA, which is an antigen-antibody interaction. The reducing conditions were investigated to generate efficient conjugates of quantum dots and half-sized antibodies. This was applied to IL-6 detection, as the quantification of IL-6 is significant owing to its close relationships with various biomedical phenomena that cause different diseases. An ELISA-like assay with CdSe/ZnS quantum dot institution (QLISA; Quantum dot-linked immunosorbent assay) was developed to detect 0.05ng/mL IL-6, which makes it sufficiently sensitive as an immunosorbent assay.",

        "abstract": "The standard treatment for ovarian serous carcinoma comprises maximum debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite the high response rate to chemotherapy, the majority of patients will be resistant to first-line agents and the prognosis for these patients is particularly poor. At present there are no reliable methods to determine or predict platinum resistance. T-box 2 (TBX2) is widely expressed in cancer cells and is involved in embryonic development and cell cycle regulation. TBX2 enables cells to bypass senescence through its ability to repress the cell cycle regulators p21 and p14; silencing TBX2 induces senescence. Ectopic expression of TBX2 is associated with conferred resistance to the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and doxorubicin. In the present study the association between TBX2 expression and platinum sensitivity was investigated. A total of 54 patients with ovarian serous carcinoma (FIGO stages III and IV) were treated at Osaka City University Hospital (Osaka, Japan) from January 2005 to December 2012. Patients were divided into platinum-sensitive (n=27) and resistant (n=27) groups, according to the platinum-free interval calculated from the last platinum administration to the time of recurrence. TBX2 expression in human ovarian serous carcinoma cells was inhibited by a TBX2-specific siRNA and changes in cisplatin and carboplatin sensitivity were determined. The TBX2-weighted score was significantly lower in the platinum-sensitive group than the platinum-resistant group (P=0.005) and the low TBX2 expression group was significantly more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy (P=0.004). Sensitivity to cisplatin and carboplatin significantly increased when TBX2 expression was inhibited in human ovarian serous carcinoma cells  (P<0.05). TBX2 expression may serve as a predictive marker of the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with ovarian serous carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "The standard treatment for locally advanced uterine cervical cancer is concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Successful neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may reduce tumor size and facilitate a hysterectomy, thereby improving the prognosis for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. In contrast, unsuccessful NAC may worsen the prognosis because if a hysterectomy is not possible, the change in treatment plan may delay the initiation of core treatment. Therefore, there is a need to identify biomarkers that predict the efficacy of NAC in patients with uterine cervical cancer. The xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XPA) protein serves a major role in nucleotide excision repair, which is a key DNA damage response pathway involved in cisplatin resistance. In the present study, the association between XPA expression in tumor tissue and the efficacy of NAC for locally advanced uterine cervical cancer was investigated. Data from 56 patients aged <70 years with locally advanced uterine cervical cancer (FIGO stages IIIA or IIIB) who were classified into two groups based on effective (n=31) and ineffective (n=25) responses to NAC treatment was evaluated. Tumor tissue samples were obtained by punch biopsy prior to NAC and XPA expression was examined immunohistochemically and scored using a weighted scoring system. In addition, the effects of RNA interference-mediated downregulation of XPA on the cisplatin sensitivity of uterine cervical cancer cells was investigated . It was revealed that the NAC effective group had significantly lower weighted XPA scores than the NAC ineffective group (P=0.001). Similarly, low tumor expression of XPA was significantly associated with higher sensitivity to NAC (P=0.001). Additionally, the downregulation of XPA expression in cervical cancer cells significantly increased their sensitivity to cisplatin . The results of the present study suggest that low XPA expression may be a predictive biomarker of NAC efficacy for patients with locally advanced uterine cervical cancer, which may be helpful for improving their prognosis.",

        "abstract": "The warning statement issued by the United States Food and Drug Administration against the use of laparoscopic power morcellators prompted a discussion about the methods of preoperative diagnosis of uterine myometrial lesions. Since 1994, transcervical needle biopsies have been performed to differentiate between uterine leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas. Needle biopsies are also useful for performing laparoscopic surgery on uterine smooth muscle tumors with histopathological safety. In the present study, data from hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained specimens obtained by transcervical needle biopsies from 331 patients with smooth muscle tumors and high intensity regions on T1 weighted images (WI) and/or T2WI from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were retrospectively examined. From a total of 10 patients with moderate or severe cytological atypia, 4 exhibited smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential and 6 exhibited leiomyosarcomas. The final diagnosis in 3 patients with \u226510 mitotic figures/high-power field was leiomyosarcoma. A total of 5 patients with coagulative tumor cell necrosis exhibited final diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma. Patients without cytological atypia, mitotic figures or coagulative tumor cell necrosis were not diagnosed with either leiomyosarcomas or smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential. The present study revealed that laparoscopic surgery is safe when HE-stained specimens obtained by transcervical needle biopsy from areas of high intensity on an MRI scan are negative for all three criteria assessed-cytological atypia, mitotic figures and coagulative tumor cell necrosis.",

        "abstract": "The standard treatment for ovarian serous carcinoma is maximum debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite the high response rate for chemotherapy, the majority of patients will be resistant to first-line agents and the prognosis for these patients is particularly poor. Currently there are no reliable methods to determine or predict platinum resistance. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is widely expressed in cancer cells and regulates the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). A reduction in ROS is associated with carcinogenesis and chemoresistance. Downregulation of UCP2 significantly causes increased cell death following chemotherapy. The present study investigated the association between UCP2 expression and platinum sensitivity. The study included 54 patients with ovarian serous carcinoma (FIGO stages III and IV) who were treated at Osaka City University Hospital between January 2005 and December 2012. Patients were divided into a platinum-sensitive group (n=27) and platinum-resistant group (n=27) based on the platinum-free interval, which was calculated from the time of last platinum administration to the time of recurrence. UCP2 expression in human ovarian serous carcinoma cells was inhibited by genipin, and changes in carboplatin sensitivity were examined. The UCP2 weighted score was lower in the platinum-sensitive group than in the platinum resistant-group (P=0.005). In addition, patients in the low UCP2 expression group were more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy than those in the high UCP2 expression group (P=0.001). Sensitivity to carboplatin was significantly increased when UCP2 was inhibited in human ovarian serous carcinoma cells . UCP2 expression may be a predictive marker of the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with ovarian serous carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 40% of all patients with ovarian cancer in Japan are aged \u226565 years. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the differences in prognosis and prognostic factors between elderly and younger patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. A total of 114 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I-IV ovarian cancer who were initiated on primary treatment at the Osaka City University Hospital (Osaka, Japan) were included in this study. Patient characteristics, treatment outcome and prognosis were compared between elderly (aged \u226565 years) and younger patients, and the prognostic factors associated with overall survival were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. The most common histological type in younger patients was clear cell carcinoma (33.8%) vs. serous carcinoma in elderly patients (44.1%), with a significant difference in the distribution of histological type (P=0.006). Complete resection was achieved in 56.2% of younger patients compared with 32.4% of elderly patients (P=0.03). The rates of standard primary treatment were comparable (56.7% of younger vs. 50.0% of elderly patients). Overall and disease-free survival did not differ significantly between the two groups. Multivariate analyses identified FIGO stage and standard primary therapy as prognostic factors in younger patients and performance status in elderly patients. Age was not an independent significant prognostic factor among patients with ovarian cancer. Therefore, performance status, rather than age, should be considered when selecting the optimal treatment for elderly patients based on objective assessment.",

        "abstract": "Opportunities for patients undergoing hemodialysis to receive chemotherapy are increasing. A combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC) is first-line chemotherapy in patients with M\u00fcllerian cancer. However, the optimal dose and time interval between the end of carboplatin administration and initiation of hemodialysis remains to be elucidated. TC was administered to a patient with fallopian tube cancer undergoing hemodialysis. The paclitaxel regimen was determined to be 135 mg/m (total of 210 mg) over 3 h. After paclitaxel administration, 125 mg of carboplatin was administered over 1 h to achieve a target area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5.0 mg\u2022min/ml using the Calvert formula. The time interval between the end of carboplatin administration and hemodialysis initiation was 1 h at the first cycle, 16 h at the second cycle and 20 h at the third cycle, and the AUC obtained was 2.86, 4.16 and 6.0 mg\u2022min/ml, respectively. The desired AUC of free platinum was demonstrated and only mild side effects were observed at the third cycle. Therefore, hemodialysis was initiated 20 h after completion of carboplatin infusion at cycles 4-6. The total chemotherapy planned was completed without severe adverse events. Measurement of the concentration of free platinum subsequent to administration is useful for determination of the optimal dose of carboplatin and time interval following administration to obtain an adequate AUC. The present study suggests that carboplatin can be administered to a patient undergoing hemodialysis, and that an adequate interval between the end of carboplatin administration and hemodialysis initiation may be ~20 h.",

        "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by hysterectomy may be effective for the treatment of locally advanced uterine cervical cancer and improve patient prognosis. It is important to identify markers that are able to predict whether NAC may be successful. Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) regulates vascular sprouting in blood vessel formation. In numerous types of human cancer, EGFL7 is upregulated and inhibits endothelial cell adhesion molecules, decreasing vascular tightness and, thus, increasing vascular permeability. It is considered that the overexpression of EGFL7 is able to inhibit drug delivery, resistance to apoptosis and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In the current study, 63 patients with locally advanced uterine cervical cancer were reviewed and classified as stage IIIA-IIIB using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics criteria. These patients (aged <70 years) were treated at Osaka City University Medical School Hospital, Japan, between 1995 and 2010. Tumor tissue samples were obtained by biopsy prior to NAC. The tissue samples were classified as group 1 or 2 depending on the efficacy of NAC. Surgery and radiotherapy were administered in group 1 (n=36), for which NAC was effective. In the patients of group 2 NAC was not effective, and radiotherapy alone was administered (n=27). The expression of EGFL7 and Snail was examined in paraffin-embedded tissue sample sections using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method. The results indicated that EGFL7 expression levels were significantly higher in group 2, as compared with group 1 (P<0.001). A similar result was observed for the expression levels of Snail (P=0.001). Group 1 exhibited significantly longer overall survival times compared with group 2 (P=0.001). The patients were also classified into a low EGFL7 expression level group (weighted score of \u22646) and a high EGFL7 expression level group (weighted score of \u22658). NAC was observed to be significantly more effective in the low EGFL7 expression level group (P<0.001), as compared with the high expression level group. The results suggest that the expression levels of EGFL7 may be a potential predictive marker of the efficacy of NAC for the treatment of locally advanced uterine cervical cancer.",

The prognosis of vaginal melanoma is extremely poor, as it is often resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and metastases may develop in the early stages of the disease. The present study investigated 5 patients with vaginal melanoma treated at the Department of Gynecology of Osaka City University Hospital (Osaka, Japan) between October, 2000 and April, 2014. All the cases presented with abnormal genital bleeding as the main complaint. Notably, in 3 of the 5 cases the tumors appeared as non-pigmented polyps. Local resection was performed as the primary treatment in all 5 cases. After surgery, dermal injection of interferon \u03b2 (feron maintenance therapy) was performed in 3 cases, and dacarbazine, nimustine, vincristine and interferon \u03b2 (DAVFeron therapy) was administered in 1 case as adjuvant therapy. All 5 cases recurred within 1 year. The site of recurrence varied, and included the vaginal wall, liver, brain and lung. The median overall survival was 419 days and the median progression-free survival 177 days. In this cohort, all the cases presented with abnormal genital bleeding as the main complaint. Therefore, malignant melanoma of the vagina must be considered along with other gynecological malignancies in patients with abnormal genital bleeding. In this study, over half of the cases had a non-pigmented polypoid lesion of the vagina. Therefore, malignant melanoma of the vagina must be considered when a polypoid lesion is identified on the vaginal wall.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To determine the feasibility of dual-energy (DE) computed tomography (CT) with an iodine overlay image (IOI) for evaluation of psoriatic arthritis in the hand. Materials and Methods Approval from the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent from all patients were obtained. This prospective study included 16 patients who had psoriasis with finger joint symptoms from January 2015 to January 2016. Contrast material-enhanced (CE) DE CT and 1.5-T CE magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed within 1 month of each other. DE CT was performed with a tube voltage of 80 kV and 140 kV with use of a 0.4-mm tin filter. Images acquired with both modalities were evaluated by two radiologists independently by using a semiquantitative scoring system. Interreader agreement was calculated for each modality: Weighted \u03ba values were calculated for synovitis, flexor tenosynovitis, and extensor peritendonitis, and \u03ba values were calculated for periarticular inflammation. With consensus scores and CE MR images as the reference, the sensitivity and specificity of IOI DE CT for inflammatory lesions were calculated. Statistical analysis of discordant readings was performed by using the McNemar test. Results Interreader agreement for inflammatory lesions was excellent or good (weighted \u03ba = 0.83 and \u03ba = 0.75 in IOI DE CT; weighted \u03ba = 0.81 and \u03ba = 0.87 in CE MR imaging). The sensitivity and specificity of IOI DE CT were 0.78 and 0.87, respectively. Total agreement was 86.3%; however, there were significantly more lesions detected with IOI DE CT than with CE MR imaging alone (134 vs 20 lesions in 1120 evaluated items; P < .001). Sixty-nine percent of the abnormalities detected with IOI DE CT alone were located in distal interphalangeal joints. Conclusion IOI DE CT is a new imaging modality that may be useful for evaluating psoriatic arthritis in the hand, particularly in the detection of inflammatory lesions in small joints, and may be more useful than CE MR imaging, within the limitation that there is no histopathologic reference.

Recent studies have shown significantly higher EAT volume in psoriatic patients compared with that in control subjects, but this has not been validated in Japanese patients. We enrolled 86 Japanese patients with moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and 31 control subjects, and evaluated EAT volume and coronary artery calcification (CAC) by retrospectively assessing non-enhanced computed tomography obtained through routine examinations. Both mean EAT volume and mean CAC score were not significantly different between the two groups. Interestingly, however, a subanalysis with those of 50\u00a0years of age or less (28 psoriatic patients and seven non-psoriatic subjects) showed significantly higher mean EAT volume in psoriatic patients. Similarly, the ratio of the presence of at least one CAC was significantly higher in this group. Our findings suggest that Japanese psoriatic patients should also be aware of the cardiovascular risk, and EAT volume and CAC may be useful tools to predict such risk.",

Hepcidin inhibition could be a strategy for treating anemia of chronic disease. We previously reported the discovery of DS79182026, a new inhibitor of hepcidin production, from phenotypic screening using the human hepatocyte HepG2 cell line. In this study, we utilized a combination of affinity purification-based chemical proteomics and radioactive compound binding assay, and identified several candidate proteins. Purified recombinant proteins were subjected to radioactive compound binding assays for validation, and ALK2 and ALK3 demonstrated specific binding to the compound. Since ALK2 is known to be related to hepcidin production, we focused on ALK2 and found that its knockdown decreased hepcidin expression; we also found a strong correlation (R\u202f=\u202f0.920) between pharmacological activity and compound affinity to ALK2. These results indicate that ALK2 is the primary target protein of our new hepcidin production inhibitors.",

Non-contact measurement of vital signs using radar has been attracting much attention because such technologies can breakthrough benefits for monitoring health conditions without electrodes or wearable devices. Most existing studies have measured echoes from the torso, particularly the chest wall. However, this is difficult because of multiple interfering reflections from the complex shape of the torso and other body parts, such as limbs. The current study is the first demonstration that non-contact heart rate measurement can be easily achieved using echoes from the human head. There are two important advantages of measurement from the human head: (i) the simple shape of the head makes an ideal radar target with only a single reflection, and (ii) the other undesired echoes can be removed using time-gating when an ultra-wideband radar is used. Nonetheless, because the displacement of the human head due to heart rate is small, a millimetre-wave ultra-wideband array radar system is developed, which is installed on the ceiling and used in the proposed measurements with participants.",

        "abstract": "To measure vital signs using Doppler radar, a common approach involves the use of time-varying echo phase. To acquire these measurements, clutter rejection is necessary because clutter power is often larger than echo power. To reject static clutter, several techniques have been proposed that assume relatively large phase rotation angles because many studies assume the measurement of the upper torso, where displacement is mainly caused by respiration. However, signals from other parts of the human body are known to have smaller displacements that exhibit small phase rotation angles, which make clutter rejection more difficult. Three clutter rejection techniques for measuring small displacements are compared and their performances are investigated. Using numerical analysis, one method is demonstrated to be the most effective, even for small displacements in noisy data. The best method successfully estimates the centre with an error of \u221213.4 and \u221224.0 dB, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 and 40 dB and the range of phase rotation angles of 90\u00b0 and 15\u00b0.",

Recently, low-cost radar systems have been intensively studied for this purpose, employing Doppler interferometry technology to image a single human target. The technique, however, has limitations when there is more than one target person in the scene. To resolve this problem, we combined the Doppler interferometry algorithm with adaptive array processing. This approach enables the separation of multiple human targets with the help of a clustering algorithm. We applied the proposed method to simulated data and demonstrated that it could separate multiple human echoes with a root-mean-square error of 4.3 cm, which makes the accuracy more than three times higher than that of the conventional method.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar imaging has attracted attention for use in security and intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications. Conventional UWB Doppler interferometry is an effective way to obtain high-resolution images while using a simple radar system. However, this method produces ghost images when multiple closely-spaced human targets are present. To resolve this problem, we propose a new technique that combines UWB Doppler interferometry with an adaptive beamforming method called estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT). We also propose a tracking and separation algorithm that uses the \u03ba-nearest neighbor method. Through a combination of numerical simulations and measurements, we demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement that can be achieved using our proposed method. The proposed method can separate multiple humans with a root-mean-square error of 5.2 cm, which makes its accuracy 1.9 times higher than that of the conventional method.",

Die Freisetzung von 133 Xe, 135 Xe, 138 Xe, 85m Kr, 87 Kr and 88 Kr aus gesintertem UO 2 wurde zwischen 250 und 930\u00b0C in einem Graphit-Probenhalter bestimmt. Zur Gewinnung der Netto-Freisetzung aus der UO 2 -Tablette wurde die Freisetzung aus dem Halter, in den ein Teil durch R\u00fcckstoss implantiert wurde, abgezogen. Die Freisetzung aus dem UO 2 durch Stoss wurde direkt gemessen. Dies ist jedoch nicht der vorherrschende Freisetzungsmechanismus, zumindest nicht f\u00fcr kurzlebige Kerne. Es wird ein Pseudo-R\u00fcckstossmodell vorgeschlagen, mit dem die Freisetzung bei tiefen Temperaturen unter Bestrahlung erkl\u00e4rt wird. In diesem Modell dienen einige der durch Spaltfragmente gebildeten Defekte als kurzlebige Tr\u00e4ger des Spaltgases.",
