        "abstract": "To better understand the characteristics of precipitation chemistry and its relationship with atmospheric transport at a background site in Liaoning Province,pH,conductivities and ionic concentrations of rain samples were analyzed at Liaozhong hydrological site from February 2007 to January 2008.pH was found to range from 3.4 to 7.3,with a precipitation volume weighted average of 4.6,representing generally acidic acidity.The major anions,SO_4~(2-) and NO_3~-, were found to be 154.3 and 53.4 \u03bceq\ue4d4L respectively and occupied 76.8% of all anions.With concentrations of 124.6 and 89.2 \u03bceq\ue4d4L respectively,the NH_4~+ and Ca~(2+) occupied 70.6% of all cations.Backward trajectory analysis was conducted to gain further insights into the influence of the origination and travelling path of air masses on the chemical composition of the collected rain samples.The results suggest that the samples with high ion concentrations were found to be mainly influenced by locally originated air masses,while those with lower ion values were mainly caused by south-southeast air masses originating from Eastern Asia and then traveling across the Korean peninsula.",

        "abstract": "Because volatile organic compounds(VOCs) are one of the most important precursors of tropospheric ozone,understanding their characteristics and sources are of great significance in controlling ozone.The contents of VOCs,O3,NO2,temperature and UV radiation were simultaneously monitored by online method from 10th August to 18th September 2006 at Wuqing Meteorology Bureau in a Tianjin suburb.In addition,the concentrations,propene-equivalent concentrations(Prop-Equiv),and OFP of the VOCs were investigated from September 10th to 15th during an ozone episode.The results showed that: 1) the mean mixing ratio of hourly VOCs was about 24.6\u00d710-9;2) alkanes were the most abundant components followed by alkenes and aromatics,and vehicle emissions,light hydrocarbon industrial processes,biogenic sources,biogas and hydrocarbon solvents were their major sources.According to assessment using both the OH-reactivity-based method(Prop-Equiv) and maximum incremental reactivity,alkenes were shown to play a dominant role in photochemical ozone production,and isoprene,propene,xylene and toluene were the top compounds with the highest ozone formation potential.VOCs in the suburban and urban areas of Tianjin City were different,not only in the chemical composition,but also in their chemical-reactive species.",

To best recognize the influence of haze days on regional air quality, the pollution levels of deleterious gases of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene) and carbonyls (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone) under haze and non-haze days were contrastively investigated during the period of September 2008-August 2010 in Beijing. In comparison with non-haze days, remarkable enhancement of BTEX and the carbonyls under haze days in winter was found, with enhancement factors of 1.9-5.7 for BTEX and of 1.5-4.2 for the carbonyls. Whereas the enhancement factors for both BTEX (1.0-3.0) and the carbonyls (1.2-1.9) under haze days in summer were relatively small. The ratios of each BTEX to CO under both haze days and non-haze days exhibited a minimal value in the afternoon, whereas maximal values for the ratios of the carbonyls to CO were usually found in the afternoon. The ratios of each BTEX to CO were extremely greater under haze days than those under non-haze days in winter, but no evident difference was found in summer. The ratios of each carbonyl under both haze days and non-haze days in summer were at least a factor of 2 greater than those in winter and only enhancement of the ratios under haze days was found in winter. The remarkably higher ratios of ethylbenzene to m,p-xylene under haze days than non-haze days in both winter and summer revealed high reactivity of photochemical reactions initiated by OH radicals under haze days.",

Here, we conducted the first objective analysis of tiling array platforms, amplification procedures, and signal detection algorithms in a simulated ChIP-chip experiment. Mixtures of human,genomic,DNA and,\u201cspike-ins\u201d comprised,of nearly 100 human,sequences,at various concentrations,were hybridized,to four tiling array platforms by eight independent,groups. Blind to the number,of spike-ins, their locations, and the range of concentrations, each group made predictions of the spike-in locations. We found that microarray platform choice is not the primary determinant of overall performance. In fact, variation in performance between labs, protocols, and algorithms within the same array platform was greater than the variation in performance between array platforms. However, each array platform had unique performance characteristics that varied with tiling resolution and the number of replicates, which have implications for cost versus detection power. Long oligonucleotide arrays were slightly more sensitive at detecting very low enrichment. On all platforms, simple sequence repeats and genome redundancy tended to result in false positives. LM-PCR and WGA, the most popular sample amplification techniques, reproduced relative enrichment levels with high fidelity. Performance among signal detection algorithms was,heavily dependent,on array platform. The spike-in DNA samples,and,the data presented here provide a stable benchmark against which future ChIP platforms, protocol improvements, and analysis methods can be evaluated.

        "abstract": "Tissue development and function are exquisitely dependent on proper regulation of gene expression, but it remains controversial whether the genomic signals controlling this process are subject to strong selective constraint. While some studies show that highly constrained noncoding regions act to enhance transcription, other studies show that DNA segments with biochemical signatures of regulatory regions, such as occupancy by a transcription factor, are seemingly unconstrained across mammalian evolution. To test the possible correlation of selective constraint with enhancer activity, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation as an approach unbiased by either evolutionary constraint or prior knowledge of regulatory activity to identify DNA segments within a 66-Mb region of mouse chromosome 7 that are occupied by the erythroid transcription factor GATA1. DNA segments bound by GATA1 were identified by hybridization to high-density tiling arrays, validated by quantitative PCR, and tested for gene regulatory activity in erythroid cells. Whereas almost all of the occupied segments contain canonical WGATAR binding site motifs for GATA1, in only 45% of the cases is the motif deeply preserved (found at the orthologous position in placental mammals or more distant species). However, GATA1-bound segments with high enhancer activity tend to be the ones with an evolutionarily preserved WGATAR motif, and this relationship was confirmed by a loss-of-function assay. Thus, GATA1 binding sites that regulate gene expression during erythroid maturation are under strong selective constraint, while nonconstrained binding may have only a limited or indirect role in regulation.",

        "title": "The Genomic Distribution and Function of Histone Variant HTZ-1 during C. elegans Embryogenesis",
        "abstract": "In all eukaryotes, histone variants are incorporated into a subset of nucleosomes to create functionally specialized regions of chromatin. One such variant, H2A.Z, replaces histone H2A and is required for development and viability in all animals tested to date. However, the function of H2A.Z in development remains unclear. Here, we use ChIP-chip, genetic mutation, RNAi, and immunofluorescence microscopy to interrogate the function of H2A.Z (HTZ-1) during embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, a key model of metazoan development. We find that HTZ-1 is expressed in every cell of the developing embryo and is essential for normal development. The sites of HTZ-1 incorporation during embryogenesis reveal a genome wrought by developmental processes. HTZ-1 is incorporated upstream of 23% of C. elegans genes. While these genes tend to be required for development and occupied by RNA polymerase II, HTZ-1 incorporation does not specify a stereotypic transcription program. The data also provide evidence for unexpectedly widespread independent regulation of genes within operons during development; in 37% of operons, HTZ-1 is incorporated upstream of internally encoded genes. Fewer sites of HTZ-1 incorporation occur on the X chromosome relative to autosomes, which our data suggest is due to a paucity of developmentally important genes on X, rather than a direct function for HTZ-1 in dosage compensation. Our experiments indicate that HTZ-1 functions in establishing or maintaining an essential chromatin state at promoters regulated dynamically during C. elegans embryogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Among organisms with chromosome-based mechanisms of sex determination, failure to equalize expression of X-linked genes between the sexes is typically lethal. In C. elegans, XX hermaphrodites halve transcription from each X chromosome to match the output of XO males. Here, we mapped the binding location of the condensin homolog DPY-27 and the zinc finger protein SDC-3, two components of the C. elegans dosage compensation complex (DCC). We observed strong foci of DCC binding on X, surrounded by broader regions of localization. Binding foci, but not adjacent regions of localization, were distinguished by clusters of a 10-bp DNA motif, suggesting a recruitment-and-spreading mechanism for X recognition. The DCC was preferentially bound upstream of genes, suggesting modulation of transcriptional initiation and polymerase-coupled spreading. Stronger DCC binding upstream of genes with high transcriptional activity indicated a mechanism for tuning DCC activity at specific loci. These data aid in understanding how proteins involved in higher-order chromosome dynamics can regulate transcription at individual loci.",

        "abstract": "Although microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in normal human physiology and disease, transcriptional regulation of miRNAs is poorly understood, because most miRNA promoters have not yet been characterized. We identified the proximal promoters of 175 human miRNAs by combining nucleosome mapping with chromatin signatures for promoters. We observe that one-third of intronic miRNAs have transcription initiation regions independent from their host promoters and present a list of RNA polymerase II- and III-occupied miRNAs. Nucleosome mapping and linker sequence analyses in miRNA promoters permitted accurate prediction of transcription factors regulating miRNA expression, thus identifying nine miRNAs regulated by the MITF transcription factor/oncoprotein in melanoma cells. Furthermore, DNA sequences encoding mature miRNAs were found to be preferentially occupied by positioned-nucleosomes, and the 3' end sites of known genes exhibited nucleosome depletion. The high-throughput identification of miRNA promoter and enhancer regulatory elements sheds light on evolution of miRNA transcription and permits rapid identification of transcriptional networks of miRNAs.",

Unfortunately, the large number of cells needed for the standard ChIP protocol has hindered the analysis of many biologically interesting cell populations that are difficult to obtain in large numbers. New ChIP methods involving the use of carrier chromatin have been developed that allow the one-gene-at-a-time analysis of very small numbers of cells. However such methods are not useful if the resultant sample will be applied to genomic microarrays or used in ChIP-sequencing assays. Therefore, we have miniaturized the ChIP protocol such that as few as 10,000 cells (without the addition of carrier reagents) can be used to obtain enough sample material to analyze the entire human genome. We demonstrate the reproducibility of this MicroChIP technique using 2.1 million feature high-density oligonucleotide arrays and antibodies to RNA polymerase II and to histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 27 or lysine 9.",

Although it is known that lineage specification depends on cell-specific gene expression, which in turn is driven by promoters, enhancers, insulators and other cis-regulatory DNA sequences for each gene1, 2, 3, the relative roles of these regulatory elements in this process are not clear. We have previously developed a chromatin-immunoprecipitation-based microarray method (ChIP-chip) to locate promoters, enhancers and insulators in the human genome4, 5, 6. Here we use the same approach to identify these elements in multiple cell types and investigate their roles in cell-type-specific gene expression. We observed that the chromatin state at promoters and CTCF-binding at insulators is largely invariant across diverse cell types. In contrast, enhancers are marked with highly cell-type-specific histone modification patterns, strongly correlate to cell-type-specific gene expression programs on a global scale, and are functionally active in a cell-type-specific manner. Our results define over 55,000 potential transcriptional enhancers in the human genome, significantly expanding the current catalogue of human enhancers and highlighting the role of these elements in cell-type-specific gene expression.",

The use of enzymes sensitive to cytosine methylation allows high-throughput analysis of this epigenetic regulatory process. We show that the use of a dual-adapter approach allows us to generate genomic representations that includes fragments of <200 bp in size, previously not possible when using the standard approach of using a single adapter. By expanding the representation to smaller fragments using HpaII or MspI, we increase the representation by these isoschizomers to more than 1.32 million loci in the human genome, representing 98.5% of CpG islands and 91.1% of refSeq promoters. This advance allows the development of a new, high-resolution version of our HpaII-tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR (HELP) assay to study cytosine methylation. We also show that the MspI representation generates information about copy-number variation, that the assay can be used on as little as 10 ng of DNA and that massively parallel sequencing can be used as an alternative to microarrays to read the output of the assay, making this a powerful discovery platform for studies of genomic and epigenomic abnormalities.",

We study the constraints which current cosmological data place on the\nlocation of such a break, and more generally on the position of the break and\nthe slope at length scales smaller than the break. The observational data we\nuse include the WMAP five-year data set (WMAP5), other CMB data from BOOMERanG,\nCBI, VSA, and ACBAR, large-scale structure data from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS, their luminous red galaxies sample), Type Ia Supernovae data (the\n\"Union\" compilation), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Lyman-\\alpha forest\npower spectrum (Ly\\alpha) data. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method\nto constrain the features in the primordial power spectrum which are motivated\nby the matter bounce model. We give an upper limit on the length scale where\nthe break in the spectrum occurs.",

In this Letter, we study the effectiveness of the usage of this distance information and find that the compressed CMB information can give similar constraints on dark energy parameters compared with the full CMB power spectrum if dark energy perturbations are included; however, if the dark energy perturbations are incorrectly neglected, the difference of the results is sizable. \u00a9 2008.

        "abstract": "We investigate the constraints on cosmological parameters especially for EoS\nof dark energy, inflationary parameters, neutrino mass and curvature of\nuniverse using simulated Planck data. Firstly we determine cosmological\nparameters with current observations including ESSENCE, WMAP3, Boomerang-2K2,\nCBI, VSA, ACBAR, SDSS LRG and 2dFGRS, and take best-fit model as the fiducial\nmodel in simulations. In simulations we pay attention to the effects of\ndynamical dark energy in determination of cosmological parameters. We add\nsimulated SNAP data to do all the simulations. Using present data, we find\nQuintom dark energy model is mildly favored while \\LambdaCDM remains a good\nfit. In the framework of dynamical dark energy, the constraints on inflationary\nparameters, m_{\\nu} and \\Omega_{K} become weak compared with the constraints in\n\\LambdaCDM. Intriguingly, we find that the inflationary models with a \"blue\"\ntilt, which are excluded about 2\\sigma in \\LambdaCDM model, are well within\n2\\sigma region with the presence of the dynamics of dark energy. The upper\nlimits of neutrino mass are weakened by a factor of 2 (95% C.L.), say,\nm_{\\nu}<1.59 eV and m_{\\nu}<1.53 eV for two forms of parametrization of the\nequation of state of dark energy. The flat universe is a good fit to the\ncurrent data, namely, |\\Omega_{K}|<0.03 (95% C.L.). With the simulated Planck\nand SNAP data, dynamical dark energy and \\LambdaCDM might be distinguished at\n4\\sigma. And uncertainties of inflationary parameters, m_{\\nu} and \\Omega_{K}\ncan be reduced obviously. We also constrain the rotation angle \\Delta\\alpha,\ndenoting possible cosmological CPT violation, with simulated Planck and CMBpol\ndata and find that our results are much more stringent than current constraint\nand will verify cosmological CPT symmetry with a higher precision.

        "title": "Overcoming the Circular Problem for \u03b3\u2212ray Bursts in Cosmological Global Fitting Analysis",
        "abstract": "Due to the lack of low redshift long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), the circular prob- lem has been a severe obstacle for using GRBs as cosmological candles. In this paper, we present a new method to deal with such a problem in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) global fitting analysis. Our methodology is similar t o that of self-calibrations in using clusters of galaxies as cosmological probes. Assuming that a certain type of correlations between different observables exists in a sub sample of GRBs, for the pa- rameters involved in the correlation relation, we treat the m as free parameters and de- termine them simultaneously with cosmological parameters through MCMC analysis on GRB data together with other observational data, such as SNe Ia, cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS). Then the circular prob- lem is naturally eliminated in this procedure. To demonstrate the feasibility of our method, we take the Ghirlanda relation (E \u221d CEA peak) as an example while keep- ing in mind the debate about its physical validity. Together with SNe Ia, WMAP and SDSS data, we include 27 GRBs with the reported Ghirlanda relation in our study, and perform MCMC global fitting. We consider theCDM model and dynamical dark energy models with equation of state (EoS) wDE = w0 + w1(1 \u2212 a) and the oscillating EoS wDE = w0 + w1 sin(w2 ln(a)), respectively. We also include the curvature of the universe in our analysis. In each case, in addition to the con straints on the relevant cosmological parameters, we obtain the best fit values as wel l as the distributions of the correlation parameters A and C. We find that the observational data sets other than GRBs can affect A and C considerably through their degeneracies with the cosmolog- ical parameters. With CMB+LSS+SNe+GRB data included in theanalysis, the results on A and C for different cosmological models are in well agreement within 1\u03c3 range. The best fit value of A in all models being analyzed is A \u223c 1.53 with \u03c3 \u223c 0.08. For C, we have the best value in the range of 0.94 \u2212 0.98 with \u03c3 \u223c 0.1.

Of particular importance is the choice of prior, which must be chosen carefully to minimise variance and bias in the reconstruction. Using a principal component analysis, we show how a correlated prior can be used to create a smooth reconstruction and also avoid bias in the mean behaviour of w(z). We test our method using Wiener reconstructions based on Fisher matrix projections, and also against more realistic MCMC analyses of simulated data sets for Planck and a future space-based dark energy mission. While the accuracy of our reconstruction depends on the smoothness of the assumed w(z), the relative error for typical dark energy models is \u224510% out to redshift z = 1.5. \u00a9 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo code to study the dark matter properties in frameworks to interpret the recent observations of cosmic ray electron/positron excesses. We assume that the dark matter particles couple dominantly to leptons and consider two cases, annihilating or decaying into lepton pairs, respectively. The constraint on the central density profile from the H.E.S.S. observation of diffuse \u03b3 rays around the Galactic center is also included in the Markov chain Monte Carlo code self-consistently. In the numerical study, we have considered two cases of the background: fixed e +e- background and the relaxed one. Two data sets of electrons/positrons, i.e. PAMELA+ATIC (Data set I) and PAMELA+Fermi-LAT+H.E.S.S. (Data set II), are fitted independently, considering the current inconsistence between the observational data. We find that for Data set I, dark matter with m\u03c70.70TeV for annihilation (or 1.4 TeV for decay) and a non-negligible branching ratio to e+e- channel is favored; while for Data set II, m\u03c72.2TeV for annihilation (or 4.5 TeV for decay) and the combination of \u03bc+\u03bc- and \u03c4+\u03c4 - final states can best fit the data. We also show that the background of electrons and positrons actually will significantly affect the branching ratios. The H.E.S.S. observation of \u03b3 rays in the Galactic center ridge puts a strong constraint on the central density profile of the dark matter halo for the annihilation dark matter scenario. In this case the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, which is regarded as the typical predication from the cold dark matter scenario, is excluded with a high significance (>3\u03c3). For the decaying dark matter scenario, the constraint is much weaker. \u00a9 2010 The American Physical Society.",

We note that if the Lorentz and symmetries are broken by a Chern-Simons term in the effective Lagrangian, which couples the dual electromagnetic field strength tensor to an external four-vector, the polarization vectors of propagating CMB photons will get rotated. Using the WMAP data alone, one could put an interesting constraint on the size of such a term.

For a generally parameterized equation of state (EoS) such as\nw_D(z) = w_0+w_1\\frac{z}{1+z}, (for a single fluid or a single scalar field )\nthe dark energy perturbation diverges when its EoS crosses the cosmological\nconstant boundary w_D=-1. In this paper we present a method of treating the\ndark energy perturbations during the crossing of the $w_D=-1$ surface by\nimposing matching conditions which require the induced 3-metric on the\nhypersurface of w_D=-1 and its extrinsic curvature to be continuous. These\nmatching conditions have been used widely in the literature to study\nperturbations in various models of early universe physics, such as Inflation,\nthe Pre-Big-Bang and Ekpyrotic scenarios, and bouncing cosmologies. In all of\nthese cases the EoS undergoes a sudden change. Through a detailed analysis of\nthe matching conditions, we show that \\delta_D and \\theta_D are continuous on\nthe matching hypersurface. This justifies the method used[1-4] in the numerical\ncalculation and data fitting for the determination of cosmological parameters.\nWe discuss the conditions under which our analysis is applicable.",

        "abstract": "Due to the lack of low redshift long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), the circular\nproblem has been a severe obstacle for using GRBs as cosmological candles. In\nthis paper, we present a new method to deal with such a problem in MCMC global\nfitting analysis. Assuming that a certain type of correlations between\ndifferent observables exists in a subsample of GRBs, for the parameters\ninvolved in the correlation relation, we treat them as free parameters and\ndetermine them simultaneously with cosmological parameters through MCMC\nanalysis on GRB data together with other observational data. Then the circular\nproblem is naturally eliminated in this procedure. We take the Ghirlanda\nrelation as an example while keeping in mind the debate about its physical\nvalidity. Together with SNe Ia, WMAP and SDSS data, we include 27 GRBs with the\nreported Ghirlanda relation in our study, and perform MCMC global fitting. We\nconsider the $\\Lambda$CDM model and dynamical dark energy models. In each case,\nin addition to the constraints on the relevant cosmological parameters, we\nobtain the best fit values as well as the distributions of the correlation\nparameters $A$ and $C$. We find that the observational data sets other than\nGRBs can affect $A$ and $C$ considerably through their degeneracies with the\ncosmological parameters. The results on $A$ and $C$ for different cosmological\nmodels are in well agreement within $1\\sigma$ range. The best fit value of $A$\nin all models being analyzed is $A\\sim 1.53$ with $\\sigma \\sim 0.08$. For $C$,\nwe have the best value in the range of $0.94-0.98$ with $\\sigma\\sim 0.1$. It is\nalso noted that the distributions of $A$ and $C$ are generally broader than the\npriors used in many studies in literature. (Abriged)",

        "abstract": "Recently PAMELA released their first results on the positron and antiproton\nratios. Stimulated by the new data, we studied the cosmic ray propagation\nmodels and calculated the secondary positron and antiproton spectra. The low\nenergy positron ratio can be consistent with data in the convection propagation\nmodel. Above $\\sim 10$ GeV PAMELA data shows a clear excess on the positron\nratio. However, the secondary antiproton is roughly consistent with data. The\npositron excess may be a direct evidence of dark matter annihilation or decay.\nWe compare the positron and anti-proton spectra with data by assuming dark\nmatter annihilates or decays into different final states. The PAMELA data\nactually excludes quark pairs being the main final states, disfavors gauge\nboson final states. Only in the case of leptonic final states the positron and\nanti-proton spectra can be explained simultaneously. We also compare the\ndecaying and annihilating dark matter scenarios to account for the PAMELA\nresults and prefer to the decaying dark matter. Finally we consider a decaying\nneutralino dark matter model in the frame of supersymmetry with R-parity\nviolation. The PAMELA data is well fitted with neutralino mass $600\\sim 2000$\nGeV and life time $\\sim 10^{26}$ seconds. We also demonstrate that neutralino\nwith mass around 2TeV can fit PAMELA and ATIC data simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "With the nine-year data release of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP9), it is found that the inflationary models with the scalar spectral index ns\u22651 are excluded at about 5\u03c3 confidence level. In this paper, we set the new limits on the scalar spectral index in different cosmological models by the WMAP9 data, the small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement from the South Pole Telescope, baryon acoustic oscillation data, Hubble Telescope measurements of the Hubble constant, and supernovae luminosity distance data. In most of extended cosmological models, e.g. with a dark energy equation of state, the constraints on ns do not change significantly, when comparing with that obtained in the standard \u039bCDM model. The Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles (HZ) scale invariant spectrum is still disfavored at more than 4\u03c3 confidence level. However, when considering the model with an effective number of neutrinos Neff, we obtain the limit on the spectral index of ns=0.980\u00b10.011 (1\u03c3), due to the strong degeneracy between ns and Neff. The HZ spectrum now is consistent with the current data at 95% confidence level. Recently, the Planck collaboration has published CMB maps with the highest precision. Therefore, we also analyze these extended cosmological models again using the Planck data, and find that the degeneracy between ns and Neff still weakens the constraint on the spectral index significantly. \u00a9 2013 The Authors.",

We analyze all possible dimension-six CP-conserving operators which can give rise to an anomalous Wtb coupling which represents new physics effects generated at a higher-energy scale. For those operators which also give rise to anomalous Zbb\u0304 or right-handed Wtb couplings, we rind that they are strongly constrained by the existing Rb and b \u2192 s \u03b3 data. As a result, a collider with a luminosity of the order of 100 fb-1 is required to observe anomalous effects. For other operators which currently are subject to no strong constraints, the high-energy e\u03b3 collider can probe their couplings effectively because of the clean environment of such a collider.",

Considering that Draco is dark matter dominated, the gamma rays may be generated through dark matter annihilation in the Draco halo. In the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model we explore the parameter space to account for the gamma ray signals at CACTUS. We find that the neutralino mass is constrained to be approximately in the range between 100\u00a0GeV\u223c400\u00a0GeV and a sharp central cuspy of the dark halo profile in Draco is necessary to explain the CACTUS results. We then discuss further constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space by observations at the ground-based ARGO detector. It is found that the parameter space can be strongly constrained by ARGO if no excess from Draco is observed above 100\u00a0GeV.",

After about one year operation of Fermi-LAT,\nseveral nearby clusters are reported with stringent upper limits of GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray emission. We use the Fermi-LAT upper limits of these clusters to\nconstrain the DM model parameters. We find that the DM model distributed with\nsubstructures predicted in cold DM (CDM) scenario is strongly constrained by\nFermi-LAT $\\gamma$-ray data. Especially for the leptonic annihilation scenario\nwhich may account for the $e^{\\pm}$ excesses discovered by\nPAMELA/Fermi-LAT/HESS, the constraint on the minimum mass of substructures is\nof the level $10^2-10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$, which is much larger than that expected\nin CDM picture, but is consistent with a warm DM scenario. We further\ninvestigate the sensitivity of neutrino detections of the clusters by IceCube.\nIt is found that neutrino detection is much more difficult than $\\gamma$-rays.\nOnly for very heavy DM ($\\sim 10$ TeV) together with a considerable branching\nratio to line neutrinos the neutrino sensitivity is comparable with that of\n$\\gamma$-rays.",

Our results show that\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model remains a good fit to the current data. In a flat\nuniverse, we obtain the tight limit on the constant EoS of dark energy as,\n$w=-0.977\\pm0.056$ ($1 \\sigma$). For the dynamical dark energy models with time\nevolving EoS, we find that the best-fit values are $w_0=-1.08$ and $w_1=0.368$,\nimplying the preference of Quintom model whose EoS gets across the cosmological\nconstant boundary. For the curvature of universe, our results give\n$-0.012<\\Omega_k<0.009$ (95% C.L.) when fixing $w_{\\DE}=-1$. When considering\nthe dynamics of dark energy, the flat universe is still a good fit to the\ncurrent data. Regarding the neutrino mass limit, we obtain the upper limits,\n$\\sum m_{\\nu}<0.533$ eV (95% C.L.) within the framework of the flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM model.

Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are\nadiabatic with a power law spectrum, within the $\\Lambda$CDM model, we find\nthat the upper limit on the ratio of the tensor to scalar is $r<0.200$ (95%\nC.L.) and the inflationary models with the slope $n_s\\geq1$ are excluded at\nmore than $2 \\sigma$ confidence level. However, in the framework of dynamical\ndark energy models, the allowed region in the parameter space of ($n_s$,$r$) is\nenlarged significantly. Finally, we find no evidence for the large running of\nthe spectral index. (Abridged)",

Our toy\nmodel demonstrates the importance for inflationary cosmology both of the\ntrans-Planckian problem for cosmological perturbations and of back-reaction\neffects . Firstly, without understanding both Planck-scale physics and the\nphase which preceded inflation, it is a non-trivial assumption to take the\nperturbations to be in their local vacuum state when they exit the Hubble\nradius at late times.

This stage is characterized by exponential particle production due to the parametric resonance. We study this process in the frame of matter bounce cosmology. Our results show that the preheating process in bouncing cosmology is even more efficient than that in inflationary cosmology. In the limit of weak coupling, the period of preheating is doubled. For the case of normal coupling, the back-reaction of light fields can lead to thermalization before the bouncing point. The scenario of matter bounce curvaton could be tightly constrained due to a large coupling coefficient if the curvaton field is expected to preheat the universe directly. However, this concern can be greatly relaxed through the process of geometric preheating. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "A self-consistent global fitting method based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to study the dark matter (DM) property associated with the cosmic ray electron/positron excesses was developed in our previous work. In this work we further improve the previous study to include the hadronic branching ratio of DM annihilation/decay. The PAMELA p\u0304 data are employed to constrain the hadronic branching ratio. We find that the 95% (2\u03c3) upper limits of the quark branching ratio allowed by the PAMELA p\u0304 data is \u223c0.032 for DM annihilation and \u223c0.044 for DM decay, respectively. This result shows that the DM coupling to pure leptons is indeed favored by the current data. Based on the global fitting results, we further study the neutrino emission from DM in the galactic center. Our predicted neutrino flux is some smaller than previous works since the constraint from \u03b3-rays is involved. However, it is still capable to be detected by the forthcoming neutrino detector such as IceCube. The improved points of the present study compared with previous works include: (1) the DM parameters, both the particle physical ones and astrophysical ones, are derived in a global fitting way, (2) constraints from various species of data sets, including \u03b3-rays and antiprotons are included, and (3) the expectation of neutrino emission is fully self-consistent. \u00a9 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

Based\non the localized principal component analysis and the model selection criteria,\nwe find that the LCDM model is generally consistent with the current data, yet\nthere exists weak hint of the possible dynamics of dark energy. In particular,\na model predicting w(z)<-1 at z\\in[0.25,0.5) and w(z)>-1 at z\\in[0.5,0.75),\nwhich means that w(z) crosses -1 in the range of z\\in[0.25,0.75), is mildly\nfavored at 95% confidence level. Given the best fit model for current data as a\nfiducial model, we make future forecast from the joint data sets of JDEM,\nPlanck and LSST, and we find that the future surveys can reduce the error bars\non the w bins by roughly a factor of 10 for a 5-w-bin model.",

In addition we've also considered the implications of recent\nX-ray gas mass fraction data on dark energy, which favors a negative running of\nthe equation of state.",

We present a new\nmethod to show that the conventional dark energy models based on single\nk-essence field and perfect fluid cannot act as quintom due to the\nsingularities and classical instabilities of perturbations around $w = -1$. One\nneeds to add extra degrees of freedom for successful quintom model buildings.\nThere are no singularities or classical instabilities in perturbations of\nrealistic quintom models and they are potentially distinguishable from the\ncosmological constant. Basing on the realistic quintom models in this paper we\nprovide one way to include the perturbations for dark energy models with\nparametrized equation of state across -1.

The DM halo profile\nand the minimal halo mass, which are not yet well determined from the current\nN-body simulations, are constrained by the EGRB data from EGRET and Fermi\ntelescopes. Then we discuss the impact of such leptonic DM models on cosmic\nevolution, such as the reionization and heating of intergalactic medium,\nneutral Hydrogen 21 cm signal and suppression of structure formation. We show\nthat the impact on the Hydrogen 21 cm signal might show interesting signatures\nof DM annihilation, but the influence on star formation is not remarkable.\nFuture observations of the 21 cm signals could be used to place new constraints\non the properties of DM.",

        "abstract": "In the present Universe visible and dark matter contribute comparable energy density although they have different properties. This phenomenon can be explained if the dark matter relic density, originating from a dark matter asymmetry, is fully determined by the baryon asymmetry. Thus the dark matter mass is not arbitrary; rather, it becomes predictive. We realize this scenario in baryon (lepton) number conserving models where two or more neutral singlet scalars decay into two or three baryonic (leptonic) dark matter scalars, and also decay into quarks (leptons) through other on-shell and/or off-shell exotic scalar bilinears. The produced baryon (lepton) asymmetries in the dark matter scalar and in the standard model quarks (leptons) are thus equal and opposite. The dark matter mass can be predicted in a range from a few GeV to a few TeV, depending on the baryon (lepton) numbers of the decaying scalars and the dark matter scalar. The dark matter scalar can interact with the visible matter through the exchange of the standard model Higgs boson, opening a window for the dark matter direct detection experiments. These models also provide testable predictions in the searches for the exotic scalar bilinears at LHC. \u00a9 2011 American Physical Society.",

Unless either the\npotential of the Lee-Wick theory or the initial conditions are finely tuned, it\nis impossible to obtain background solutions which have a sufficiently long\nperiod of inflation after the bounce. More interestingly, however, we find that\nin the generic non-inflationary bouncing cosmology, perturbations created from\nquantum vacuum fluctuations in the contracting phase have the correct form to\nlead to a scale-invariant spectrum of metric inhomogeneities in the expanding\nphase. Since the background is non-singular, the evolution of the fluctuations\nis defined unambiguously through the bounce. We also analyze the evolution of\nfluctuations which emerge from thermal initial conditions in the contracting\nphase.

This coincidence can be\nelegantly explained if the dark matter relic density, originating from a dark\nmatter asymmetry, is fully determined by the baryon asymmetry. Thus the dark\nmatter mass is not arbitrary, rather becomes predictive. We realize this\nscenario in baryon(lepton) number conserving models where two or more neutral\nsinglet scalars decay into two or three baryonic(leptonic) dark matter scalars,\nand also decay into quarks(leptons) through other on-shell and/or off-shell\nexotic scalar bilinears. The produced baryon(lepton) asymmetries in the dark\nmatter scalar and in the standard model quarks(leptons) are thus equal and\nopposite. The dark matter mass can be predicted in a range from a few GeV to a\nfew TeV depending on the baryon(lepton) numbers of the decaying scalars and the\ndark matter scalar. The dark matter scalar can interact with the visible matter\nthrough the exchange of the standard model Higgs boson, opening a window for\nthe dark matter direct detection experiments. These models also provide\ntestable predictions in the searches for the exotic scalar bilinears at LHC.",

This is followed by a quintom scenario in which the background equation of state crosses the cosmological constant boundary allowing for a nonsingular bounce which in turn is followed by Galilean Genesis. We analyze the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in this background. Our results show that the fluctuations evolve smoothly and without any pathology, but the adiabatic modes form a blue tilted spectrum. In order to achieve a scale-invariant primordial power spectrum as required by current observations, we introduce a light scalar field coupling to the Galileon kinetically. We find two couplings which yield a scale-invariant spectrum, one of which requires a fine tuning of the initial conditions. This model also predicts a blue tilted spectrum of gravitational waves stemming from quantum vacuum fluctuations in the contracting phase. \u00a9 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.",

We mainly focus on cases where the EOS is oscillating or with local\nbumps. By performing a global analysis with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethod, we find the current observations, in particular the WMAP3 + SDSS data\ncombination, allow large oscillations of the EOS which can leave oscillating\nfeatures on the (residual) Hubble diagram, and such oscillations are\npotentially detectable by future observations like SNAP, or even by the\nCURRENTLY ONGOING SNIa observations. Local bumps of dark energy EOS can also\nleave imprints on CMB, LSS and SNIa. In cases where the bumps take place at low\nredshifts and the effective EOS are close to -1, CMB and LSS observations\ncannot give constraints on such possibilities. However, geometrical\nobservations like (future) SNIa can possibly detect such features. On the other\nhand when the local bumps take place at higher redshifts beyond the\ndetectability of SNIa, future precise observations like Gamma-ray bursts, CMB\nand LSS may possibly detect such features. In particular, we find that\nbump-like dark energy EOS on high redshifts might be responsible for the\nfeatures of WMAP on ranges l \\sim 30-50, which is interesting and deserves\naddressing further.",

As a result, a collider with a luminosity of the order of 100\nfb^{-1} is required to observe the anomalous effects. For other operators which\ncurrently subject to no strong constraints, the high energy e\\gamma collider\ncan probe their couplings effectively because of the clean environment of such\na collider.",

By imposing a degenerate condition on the higher derivatives in curved spacetime, one can select the models which are free from the ghost mode and the equation of state is able to cross the cosmological constant boundary smoothly, dynamically violate the null energy condition. Generally the Lagrangian of this type of dark energy models depends on the second derivatives linearly. It behaves like an imperfect fluid, thus its cosmological perturbation theory needs to be generalized. We also study such a model with explicit form of degenerate Lagrangian and show that its equation of state may cross -1 without any instability. \u00a9 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a dark matter model and study aspects of its\nphenomenology. Our model is based on a new dark matter sector with a U(1)'\ngauge symmetry plus a discrete symmetry added to the Standard Model of particle\nphysics. The new fields of the dark matter sector have no hadronic charges and\ncouple only to leptons. Our model can not only give rise to the observed\nneutrino mass hierarchy, but can also generate the baryon number asymmetry via\nnon-thermal leptogenesis. The breaking of the new U(1)' symmetry produces\ncosmic strings. The dark matter particles are produced non-thermally from\ncosmic string loop decay which allows one to obtain sufficiently large\nannihilation cross sections to explain the observed cosmic ray positron and\nelectron fluxes recently measured by the PAMELA, ATIC, PPB-BETS, Fermi-LAT, and\nHESS experiments while maintaining the required overall dark matter energy\ndensity. The high velocity of the dark matter particles from cosmic string loop\ndecay leads to a low phase space density and thus to a dark matter profile with\na constant density core in contrast to what happens in a scenario with\nthermally produced cold dark matter where the density keeps rising towards the\ncenter. As a result, the flux of gamma rays radiated from the final leptonic\nstates of dark matter annihilation from the Galactic center is suppressed and\nsatisfies the constraints from the HESS gamma-ray observations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we will give a general introduction to the project of Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT), which is a Sino-US joint project led by the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) and has involved many different institutes in China. It is the first ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization experiment in China and an integral part of Chinau0027s Gravitational Waves Program.  main scientific goal of AliCPT project is to probe the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) originated from the very early Universe. The AliCPT project includes two stages.  first stage referred to as AliCPT-1, is to build a telescope in the Ali region of Tibet with an altitude of 5,250 meters. Once completed, it will be the worldwide highest ground-based CMB observatory and open a new window for probing PGWs in northern hemisphere. AliCPT-1 telescope is designed to have about 7,000 TES detectors at 90GHz and 150GHz.  second stage is to have a more sensitive telescope (AliCPT-2) with the number of detectors more than 20,000. Our simulations show that AliCPT will improve the current constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by one order of magnitude with 3 yearsu0027 observation. Besides the PGWs, the AliCPT will also enable a precise measurement on the CMB rotation angle and provide a precise test on the CPT symmetry. We show 3 yearsu0027 observation will improve the current limit by two order of magnitude.",

We combine the latest supernova (SNLS 3 year or Union 2.1), cosmic microwave background, redshift space distortion, and the baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements (including BOSS, WiggleZ, and 6dF) and find that the cosmological constant appears consistent with current data, but that a dynamical dark energy model which evolves from w<-1 at z~0.25 to w>-1 at higher redshift is mildly favored. Estimates of the Bayesian evidence show little preference between the cosmological constant model and the dynamical model for a range of correlated prior choices. Looking towards future data, we find that the best fit models for current data could be well distinguished from the \u039bCDM model by observations such as Planck and Euclid-like surveys.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss a possibility of studying properties of dark energy\nin long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. We consider two types of\nmodels of neutrino dark energy. For one type of models the scalar field is\ntaken to be quintessence-like and for the other phantom-like. In these models\nthe scalar fields couple to the neutrinos to give rise to a spatially varying\nneutrino masses. We will show that the two types of models predict different\nbehaviors of the spatial variation of the neutrino masses inside Earth and\nconsequently result in different signals in long baseline neutrino oscillation\nexperiments.",

        "abstract": "We construct a new realization of type-II seesaw for neutrino masses and\nbaryon asymmetry by extending the standard model with one light and two heavy\nsinglet scalars besides one Higgs triplet. The heavy singlets pick up small\nvacuum expectation values to give a suppressed trilinear coupling between the\ntriplet and doublet Higgs bosons after the light singlet drives the spontaneous\nbreaking of lepton number. The Higgs triplet can thus remain light and be\naccessible at the LHC. The lepton number conserving decays of the heavy\nsinglets can generate a lepton asymmetry stored in the Higgs triplet to account\nfor the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. We further introduce\nstable gauge bosons from a hidden sector, which obtain masses and annihilate\ninto the Higgs triplet after spontaneous breaking of the associated non-Abelian\ngauge symmetry. With Breit-Wigner enhancement, the stable gauge bosons can\nsimultaneously explain the relic density of dark matter and the cosmic\npositron/electron excesses.",

        "abstract": "We investigate three Earth density models for the measurement of the CP phase in very long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments to study the effect of the potential error due to Earth density uncertainties. Two of the density models which are commonly used are global models. The third provides a more realistic density profile which takes into account the local density variation along a specific 2100 km baseline. We find significant differences among these density models. The more realistic density model has a smaller intrinsic density fluctuation and hence allows better control of the error caused by the Earth density uncertainty. We also find that the conventional CP violation (CPV) variable, i.e., the CP odd difference, is in general small. Under the running conditions assumed in the present calculation, the differences of this CPV variable among the different density models and even the CPV variable itself can be dominated over by statistical and systematic errors. Therefore, other more suitable CPV variables have to be considered in the extraction of the CP phase.",

        "abstract": "In the model of quintessino as dark matter particle, the dark matter and dark\nenergy are unified in one superfield, where the dynamics of the Quintessence\ndrives the Universe acceleration and its superpartner, quintessino, makes up\nthe dark matter of the Universe. This scenario predicts the existence of long\nlived $\\tilde{\\tau}$ as the next lightest supersymmetric particle. In this\npaper we study the possibility of detecting $\\tilde{\\tau}$ produced by the high\nenergy cosmic neutrinos interacting with the earth matter. By a detailed\ncalculation we find that the event rate is one to several hundred per year at a\ndetector with effective area of $1 km^2$.

In our model, the right-handed neutrino masses change as the\nQuintessence scalar evolves. We then examine in detail the parameter space of\nthis model allowed by the observed baryon number asymmetry. Our results show\nthat it is possible to lower the reheating temperature in this scenario in\ncomparison with the case that the neutrino masses are unchanged, which helps\nsolve the gravitino problem. Furthermore, a degenerate neutrino mass patten\nwith $m_i$ larger than the upper limit given in the minimal leptogenesis\nscenario is permitted.",

The early stage is known as inflation and the\ncurrent acceleration is driven by dark energy. Observing inflation and dark\nenergy dynamics are among the most important aspects of the current\ncosmological research. In this paper we make a first detailed probe of possible\ndegeneracies between dynamical inflation and dark energy in light of current\ncosmological observations. We find the inclusion of inflation and dark energy\nparameters together make the parameter spaces broader, but interestingly\ndeviation from scale-invariant primordial spectrum is sightly more favored by\ncurrent cosmological observations when one marginalizes over dynamical dark\nenergy models.",

The difference in baselines resulting from the 1 km separations of Daya Bay and Ling Ao reactors reduces the amplitudes of 1-3 oscillations at low energies, decreasing the sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy. A perpendicular detector location eliminates this effect. We simulate experiments under several mountains perpendicular to the Daya Bay/Ling Ao reactors, considering in particular the background from the TaiShan and YangJiang reactor complexes. In general the hierarchy can be determined most reliably underneath the 1000 meter mountain BaiYunZhang, which is 44.5 km from Daya Bay. If some planned reactors are not built then nearby 700 meter mountains at 47-51 km baselines gain a small advantage. Neglecting their low overhead burdens, hills near BaiMianShi or DongKeng would be the optimal locations. We use a weighted Fourier transform to avoid a spurious dependence on the high energy neutrino spectrum and find that a neural network can extract quantities which determine the hierarchy marginally better than the traditional RL + PV. \u00a9 2012 SISSA, Trieste, Italy.",

The \u03bc + are created by bombarding a target with a 9 mA beam of 800 MeV protons. With this proposal \u03b4 can be determined with a precision of 20 (15) degrees in 6 (12) years. In contrast with the DAE\u03b4ALUS project, only a single source is required and it runs with a duty factor limited only by maintenance requirements. As a result 9 mA is the maximum instantaneous current, greatly reducing both the technological challenges and the costs.",

        "abstract": "At upcoming medium baseline reactor neutrino experiments the spallation 9Li background will be somewhat larger than the inverse \u03b2 decay reactor neutrino signal. We use new FLUKA simulations of spallation backgrounds to optimize a class of veto strategies and find that surprisingly the optimal veto for the mass hierarchy determination has a rejection efficiency below 90%. The unrejected background has only a modest effect on the physics goals. For example \u0394\u03c72 for the hierarchy determination falls by 1.4 to 3 points depending on the muon tracking ability. The optimal veto strategy is essentially insensitive to the tracking ability, consisting of 2 meter radius, 1.1 second cylindrical vetoes of well tracked muons with showering energies above 3 to 4 GeV and 0.7 second full detector vetoes for poorly tracked muons above 15 to 18 GeV. On the other hand, as the uncertainty in \u03b8 12 will be dominated by the uncertainty in the reactor neutrino spectrum and not statistical fluctuations, the optimal rejection efficiency for the measurement of \u03b8 12 is 93% in the case of perfect tracking.",

Feasibility studies for such experiments generally determine the statistic \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd2. As the hierarchy is a discrete choice, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd2 does not obey a one degree of freedom \ufffd\ufffd2 distribution and so the number of \ufffd\ufffd's of sensitivity to the hierarchy is not the square root of \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd2. We present a simple Bayesian formula for the sensitivity to the hierarchy determination that can be expected from the median experiment as a function of \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd 2. ? 2014 SISSA.",

        "abstract": "Searching for gamma rays from dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) is a promising approach to detect dark matter (DM) due to the high DM densities and low baryon components in dSphs. The Fermi-LAT observations from dSphs have set stringent constraints on the velocity independent annihilation cross section. However, the constraints from dSphs may change in velocity dependent annihilation scenarios because of the different velocity dispersions in galaxies. In this work, we study how to set constraints on the velocity dependent annihilation cross section from the combined Fermi-LAT observations of dSphs with the kinematic data. In order to calculate the gamma ray flux from the dSph, the correlation between the DM density profile and velocity dispersion at each position should be taken into account. We study such correlation and the relevant uncertainty from kinematic observations by performing a Jeans analysis. Using the observational results of three ultrafaint dSphs with large J-factors, including Willman 1, Reticulum II, and Triangulum II, we set constraints on the p-wave annihilation cross section in the Galaxy as an example.",

        "abstract": "Discharging of the aprotic Li\u2013O2 battery relies on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) producing Li2O2 in the positive electrode, which remains incompletely understood. Here, we report a mechanistic study of the Li-ORR on a model system, i.e., an Au electrode in a Li+ dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) electrolyte. By spectroscopic identification of the reaction intermediates coupled with density functional theory calculations, we conclude that the formation of O2\u2013 and LiO2 in the Li-ORR critically depends on electrode potentials and determines the Li2O2 formation mechanism. At low overpotentials (u003e 2.0 V vs Li/Li+) O2\u2013 is identified to be the first surface intermediate, which diffuses into the bulk electrolyte and forms Li2O2 therein via a solution-mediated disproportionation mechanism. At high overpotentials (ca. 2.0\u20131.6 V vs Li/Li+) LiO2 has been observed, which can rapidly transform to Li2O2 by further electro-reduction, suggesting a surface-mediated mechanism. The solution-mediated Li2O2 formation that can ac...",

        "abstract": "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Polarization plays an important role in current cosmological studies. CMB B-mode polarization is the most effective probe to primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) and a test of the inflation as well as other theories of the early universe such as bouncing and cyclic universe. So far, major ground-based CMB polarization experiments are located in the southern hemisphere.Recently, China has launched the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) in Tibetan Plateau to measure CMB B mode polarization and detect the PGWs in northern hemisphere. AliCPT include two stages, the first one is to build a telescope at the 5250m site (AliCPT-1) and the second one is to have a more sensitive telescope at a higher altitude of about 6000m (AliCPT-2). In this paper, we report the atmospherical conditions, sky coverage and the current infrastructure associated with AliCPT. We analyzed the reanalysis data from MERRA-2 together with radiosonde data from the Ali Meteorological Service and found that the amount of water vapor has a heavy seasonal variation and October to March is the suitable observation time. We also found 95/150 GHz to be feasible for AliCPT-1 and higher frequencies to be possible for AliCPT-2. Then we analyzed the observable sky and the target fields, and showed that Ali provides us a unique opportunity to observe CMB with less foreground contamination in the northern hemisphere and is complementary to the existed southern CMB experiments. Together with the developed infrastructure, we point out that Ali opens a new window for CMB observation and will be one of the major sites in the world along with Antarctic and Atacama.",

The morphology of Li2O2 impacts strongly on the electrochemical performance of Li\u2013O2 cells in terms of energy efficiency and rate capability. Crystalline Li2O2 is readily available and its properties have been studied in depth for Li\u2013O2 batteries. However, little is known about the amorphous Li2O2 because of its rarity in high purity. Herein, amorphous Li2O2 has been synthesized by a rapid reaction of tetramethylammonium superoxide and LiClO4 in solution, and its amorphous nature has been confirmed by a range of techniques. Compared with its crystalline siblings, amorphous Li2O2 demonstrates enhanced charge-transport properties and increased electro-oxidation kinetics, manifesting itself a desirable discharge phase for high-performance Li\u2013O2 batteries.",

        "abstract": "Recently BICEP2 collaboration has announced the detection of the primordial gravitational waves at high confidence level. In light of the results of B-modes power spectrum from BICEP2 and using the based \u039bCDM, a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.20 \u22120.05 +0.07  (68% C.L.) can be obtained, however, this result is in apparent tension with the limit on standard inflation models from the recent PLANCK measurement, r < 0.11 (95% C.L.). Herein we review the recent progress on the cosmological studies after BICEP2 and discuss on different ways of reconciling the tension between PLANCK and BICEP2 data. We will discuss possible modifications on the standard cosmological model, such as including the running of scalar spectral index or other cosmological parameters correlated with inflationary cosmological parameters, or tilting the primordial power spectrum at large scales by introducing a cut off which can be predicted by bouncing cosmology. We will also comment on another possibility of generating extra B-modes of CMB polarization, namely by a non-zero polarization rotation angle during its transferring from the last scattering surface.",

This breakthrough is expected to initiate a novel probe of cosmology, the nature of gravity as well as fundamental physics. In general, signals of GWs can be classified into two categories, which are waves from astro-physical and cosmological sources respectively. Accordingly, a number of astronomical and cosmological experiments are under design across the world [2]. In particular, China is playing a very important role in this field by strengthening a series of fundamental scientific subjects, such as cosmic evolution, structure of matter, the origin of life, cognition science, and so on, in the 13th National Five-Year Plan. The Ali project, which aims at measuring the polarization patterns of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, was put forward in 2014 under the leadership of Xinmin Zhang\u2019s group and has become very promising in exploring primordial GWs.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a novel idea [1] has been proposed to relax the electroweak hierarchy problem through the cosmological inflation and the axion periotic potential. Here, we further assume that only the attractive inflation is needed to explain the light mass of the Higgs boson, where we do not need a specified periodic potential of the axion field. Attractive inflation during the early universe drives the Higgs boson mass from the large value in the early universe to the small value at present, where the Higgs mass is an evolving parameter of the Universe. Thus, the small Higgs mass can technically originate from the cosmological evolution rather than dynamical symmetry or anthropics. Further, we study the possible collider signals or constraints at a future lepton collier and the possible constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic moment. A concrete attractive relaxion model is also discussed, which is consistent with the data of Planck 2015.",

        "abstract": "We report on the first joint analysis of observational signatures from the electroweak baryogenesis in both gravitational wave (GW) detectors and particle colliders. With an effective extension of the Higgs sector in terms of the dimension-six operators, we derive a strong first-order phase transition associated with a sizable CP violation to realize a successful electroweak baryogenesis. We calculate the GW spectrum resulting from the bubble nucleation, plasma transportation, and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence of this process that occurred after the big bang and find that it yields GW signals testable with the Evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, Deci-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, and Big Bang Observer. We further identify collider signals from the same mechanism that are observable at the planning Circular Electron Positron Collider. Our analysis bridges astrophysics and cosmology with particle physics by providing significant motivation for searches for GW events peaking at the $(1{0}^{ensuremath{-}4},1)text{ }mathrm{Hz}$ range, which are associated with signals at colliders, and highlights the possibility of an interdisciplinary observational window into baryogenesis. The technique applied in analyzing early Universe phase transitions may enlighten the study of phase transitions in applied science.",

        "abstract": "The observed value of the Higgs mass indicates an instability of the Higgs scalar at large energy scales, and hence also at large field values. In the context of early universe cosmology, this is often considered to lead to problems. Here, we point out that we can use the instability of the Higgs field to generate an ekpyrotic phase of contraction. In the context of string theory, it is possible that at very high energy densities, extra states become massless leading to an S-brane which causes the transition between a contracting phase in the past and the current expanding phase. Thus, the Higgs field may be useable to generate a nonsingular bouncing cosmology in which the anisotropy problem of usual bouncing scenarios is mitigated.",

Our study shows that the effective theory using the dimension-6 operators can enforce strong first order phase transition and provide sizable CP violation to realize a successful electroweak baryogenesis. Such dimension-6 operators can induce interesting Higgs phenomenology that can be verified at colliders such as the LHC and the planning CEPC. We then demonstrate that this effective theory can originate from vector-like quarks and the triplet Higgs.",

        "abstract": "The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE), a high energy cosmic ray and $gamma$-ray detector in space, has recently reported the new measurement of the total electron plus positron flux between 25 GeV and 4.6 TeV. A spectral softening at $sim0.9$ TeV and a tentative peak at $sim1.4$ TeV have been reported. We study the physical implications of the DAMPE data in this work. The presence of the spectral break significantly tightens the constraints on the model parameters to explain the electron/positron excesses. The spectral softening can either be explained by the maximum acceleration limits of electrons by astrophysical sources, or a breakdown of the common assumption of continuous distribution of electron sources at TeV energies in space and time. The tentive peak at $sim1.4$ TeV implies local sources of electrons/positrons with quasi-monochromatic injection spectrum. We find that the cold, ultra-relativistic $e^+e^-$ winds from pulsars may give rise to such a structure. The pulsar is requird to be middle-aged, relatively slowly-rotated, mildly magnetized, and isolated in a density cavity. The annihilation of DM particles ($m_{chi}sim1.5$ TeV) into $e^+e^-$ pairs in a nearby clump or an over-density region may also explain the data. In the DM scenario, the inferred clump mass (or density enhancement) is about $10^7-10^8$ M$_odot$ (or $17-35$ times of the canonical local density) assuming a thermal production cross section, which is relatively extreme compared with the expectation from numerical simulations. A moderate enhancement of the annihilation cross section via, e.g., the Sommerfeld mechanism or non-thermal production, is thus needed.",

        "abstract": "Wang Yangming's \"grasping the truth\" at Nongchang was an event in the history of Chinese philosophical thinking that is worth commemorating. It is symbolic of Wang's triumph over the ordeals that had threatened his life and of a great leap-forward of his mind. Further,it heralded the birth of the earliest local school of mind in the country called the Yangming School of Mind in central Guizhou and ever since has exerted great influence on later philosophical thinkers in China and abroad. Indeed the emergence and development of the circle of native Guizhou philosophical thinkers is closely linked to Wang's preaching of his philosophy in central Guizhou. An abundance of discourse by generations of local scholars related to the school of mind has formed a continuous and distinctive body of values in interaction with knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Eu 3+ - and Tb 3+ -activated SrGdGa 3 O 7 phosphors were synthesized by the solid-state reaction and their luminescence properties were investigated. Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Eu x )Ga 3 O 7 and Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Tb x )Ga 3 O 7 formed continuous solid solution in the range of x = 0\u20131.0. Unactivated SrGdGa 3 O 7 exhibited a typical characteristic excitation and emission of Gd ion. The SrGdGa 3 O 7 : x Eu 3+ and SrGdGa 3 O 7 : x Tb 3+ phosphors also showed the well-known Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ excitation and emission. The energy transfer from Gd 3+ to Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ were verified by photoluminescence spectra. The dependence of photoluminescence intensity on Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ concentration were also studied in detail and the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of SrGdGa 3 O 7 :Eu and SrGdGa 3 O 7 :Tb were compared with commercial phosphors, Y 2 O 3 :Eu and LaPO 4 :Ce,Tb. The luminescence decay measurements showed that the lifetimes of Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ were in the range of microsecond. The energy transfer from Gd 3+ to Tb 3+ was also observed in decay curve. Keywords A. Optical material A. Oxides B. Chemical synthesis C. X-ray diffraction D. Luminescence 1 Introduction In recent years, great efforts have been made to develop new phosphor systems for white-LED, FED and PDP applications. Among these, a number of works have been carried out on investigation of the crystal chemistry and luminescent properties of compounds having melilite structure [1\u20138] . The general chemical formula AMM\u2032 3 O 7 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M = La, Gd, Y; M\u2032 = Al, Ga) belongs to the large families that have melilite structure. Structural investigations indicate that they form tetragonal crystals with space group P 4 \u00af 2 1 m . The crystal structure is built up from layers of M\u2032O 4 tetrahedra and between the layers the A 2+ and M 3+ ions are distributed randomly in site of C s symmetry. Many authors have reported the optical properties of these compounds [4\u20136,9\u201314] . However, there are few works that systematically investigated the photoluminescence (PL) properties of SrGdGa 3 O 7 doped with rare-earth ions. On the other hand, the lowest excited 4f level of Gd ( 6 P 7/2 ) gives rise to sharp line luminescence at about 313 nm and can sensitize the luminescence of other rare-earth ions. The energy levels of the CTS (charge-transfer state) and the 4f 6 5d 1 states are the highest among rare-earth ions, so that Gd 3+ serves as a good constituent cation in host crystals to be substituted by luminescent rare-earth ions [15] . So, we think that SrGdGa 3 O 7 might act as a potential host lattice for luminescence. This consideration prompted us to study the PL properties of this compound doped with rare-earth ions. In this present work, we report in detail the results of the PL properties, fluorescence decay lifetimes for Eu 3+ - and Tb 3+ -doped SrGdGa 3 O 7 phosphors. The energy transfer process from Gd 3+ to RE 3+ is also discussed. 2 Experimental Polycrystalline samples with the general formula Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Eu x )Ga 3 O 7 and Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Tb x )Ga 3 O 7 ( x = 0\u20131.0) were prepared by high temperature solid-state reaction. The starting materials were SrCO 3 (AR), Gd 2 O 3 (4N), Ga 2 O 3 (4N), Eu 2 O 3 (4N) and Tb 4 O 7 (4N). The raw materials were mixed homogeneously in an agate mortar and then fired at 1200\u20131400 \u00b0C for 24\u201336 h. The resulting powder samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were recorded in the range 10\u00b0 \u2264 2 \u03b8 \u2264 80\u00b0 by using a Rigaku D/max 2200 Diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation at 40 kV, 30 mA. The PL emission and excitation spectra of polycrystalline phosphors were measured by a Hitachi F4500 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer and the decay curves of the Eu 3+ ion and Tb 3+ ion in SrGdGa 3 O 7 were measured by a FLS920-Combined Time Resolved & Steady State Fluorescence Spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments). All the measurements were carried out at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase characterization The phase SrGdGa 3 O 7 has a tetragonal unit cell: a = 7.9651 \u00c5 and b = 5.2368 \u00c5 (JCPDS file: 50\u20131835). The crystal structure is built up from layers of GaO 4 tetrahedra and between the layers the Sr 2+ and Gd 3+ ions are distributed randomly in eight coordinated sites with C s symmetry. The selected X-ray diffraction patterns of Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Eu x )Ga 3 O 7 with x = 0\u20131.0 are shown in Fig. 1 . All of the peaks can be indexed to the SrGdGa 3 O 7 phase, indicating that the doping ions do not form new phases in the synthesis process. Moreover, the phases of SrGdGa 3 O 7 and SrEuGa 3 O 7 (JCPDS file: 50\u20131836) are iso-structure and continuous solid solutions form in the whole range ( x = 0\u20131.0) for the system Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Eu x )Ga 3 O 7 . On the other hand, the system Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Tb x )Ga 3 O 7 also forms continuous solid solutions in the whole range ( x = 0\u20131.0) according to the results of XRD patterns. Because the radius of Tb 3+ ( r Tb 3+ = 0.93 \u00c5) is similar to that of Gd 3+ ( r Gd 3+ = 0.97 \u00c5), it is not difficult to understand that the system Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Tb x )Ga 3 O 7 could form continuous solid solution. We also think that the phases of SrGdGa 3 O 7 and SrTbGa 3 O 7 are iso-structure according to the XRD patterns, and the detailed structure of SrTbGa 3 O 7 is worth investigating in the future. 3.2 Luminescence of unactivated SrGdGa 3 O 7 The excitation spectrum and emission spectrum of unactivated SrGdGa 3 O 7 are shown in Fig. 2 . All of the peaks exhibit well-known characteristic Gd 3+ excitations and emissions. An intense peak at 275 nm due to the 8 S 7/2 \u2013 6 I 7/2 transition dominates the excitation spectrum. The other peaks due to the 8 S 7/2 \u2013 6 D 7/2 and 8 S 7/2 \u2013 6 D 9/2 transitions are also observed at 247 nm and 254 nm, respectively. The intense emission line at 313 nm is assigned to the 6 P 7/2 \u2013 8 S 7/2 transition, whereas the weak peak at 307 nm is attributed to the 6 P 5/2 \u2013 8 S 7/2 transition. 3.3 Luminescence of Eu 3+ -activated SrGdGa 3 O 7 Fig. 3 shows the PL spectra for SrGd 0.96 Ga 3 O 7 :0.04Eu 3+ . Close examination of the excitation spectrum ( Fig. 3 (a), \u03bb em = 613 nm) reveals features due to both Gd and Eu. It shows broad bands with the maximum at about 266 nm, which can be attributed to the charge-transfer transition from O 2\u2212 to Eu 3+ . The peaks situated at 275 nm and 313 nm can be attributed to the 8 S 7/2 \u2013 6 I 7/2 and 8 S 7/2 \u2013 6 P 7/2 transitions of Gd 3+ , respectively, which indicates that the energy transfer from Gd 3+ to Eu 3+ happens. The excitation peak at 394 nm and 465 nm can be attributed to the 7 F 0 \u2013 5 L 6 and 7 F 0 \u2013 5 D 2 transitions of Eu 3+ , respectively, in addition to many other weak lines due to the various f\u2013f transitions of Eu 3+ . The phosphors of Eu 3+ -activated SrGdGa 3 O 7 are found to exhibit a red emission under UV excitation. Fig. 3 (b) shows the PL emission spectra under 266 nm UV excitation. It can be seen from Fig. 3 (b) that the spectrum is dominated by the main lines at 613 nm due to the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition and 585 nm due to the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 1 transition. The peaks from 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 (electric-dipole transition) is stronger than that from 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 1 (magnetic-dipole transition), which indicates that Eu 3+ occupies the Gd site with no inversion symmetry. This result is in agreement with the crystal structure of this material. On the other hand, the spectra also show an emission peak at 575 nm that is attributed to the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 0 transition. This transition is strictly forbidden when the crystal field is small and consequently there is no mixing between different J levels. The observation of this transition indicates that the crystal field in SrGdGa 3 O 7 :Eu 3+ is strong enough to cause significant mixing between the 7 F J multiplets, thereby relaxing the J selection rule. There are some weak peaks in the range of 500\u2013570 nm, which are assigned to the 5 D 1 \u2013 7 F J transitions. The dependence of PL intensities ( 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition of Eu 3+ , \u03bb ex = 266 nm) on Eu 3+ concentration is shown in Fig. 4 . The PL intensity increases with Eu 3+ content increasing. It is not until the Eu 3+ concentration goes beyond x = 0.08 that the emission intensity begins to decrease. However, the PL intensity does not quench a lot even if x = 1.0. Compared with commercial phosphor Y 2 O 3 :Eu, the PL intensity of SrGdGa 3 O 7 :Eu is about 15% at optimized Eu 3+ concentration. 3.4 Luminescence of Tb 3+ -activated SrGdGa 3 O 7 The excitation spectrum of the Tb 3+ emission ( \u03bb em = 543 nm) for Sr(Gd 0.95 Tb 0.05 )Ga 3 O 7 is shown in Fig. 5 (a) . It shows broad excitation band in the wavelength range 200\u2013300 nm, which can be attributed to the transition 4f 8 \u20134f 7 5d 1 (f\u2013d transition) of Tb 3+ . Besides the f\u2013d transition, it shows two excitation peaks at 275 nm and 313 nm, which can be assigned to the transitions 8 S 7/2 \u2013 6 I 7/2 and 8 S 7/2 \u2013 6 P 7/2 of Gd 3+ , respectively. The excitation spectrum shows the sharp and intense Gd 3+ excitation lines pointing to an efficient energy transfer from Gd 3+ to Tb 3+ . The PL emission spectra ( \u03bb ex = 235 nm) under different Tb 3+ concentrations are shown in Fig. 5 (b). It can be seen from Fig. 5 (b) that the phosphors with different Tb 3+ concentration exhibit well-known characteristic Tb 3+ emissions when excited into f\u2013d transition. The peaks at 482 nm, 543 nm, 586 nm and 623 nm can be attributed to 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F 6 , 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F 5 , 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F 4 and 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F 3 transitions, respectively, and the peaks at 382 nm, 416 nm and 438 nm can be assigned to 5 D 3 \u2013 7 F 6 , 5 D 3 \u2013 7 F 5 and 5 D 3 \u2013 7 F 4 transitions, respectively. The emission spectrum of Tb 3+ is strongly dependent on the Tb 3+ concentration. At lower Tb 3+ concentration (for example x = 0.001), the transitions from 5 D 3 to 7 F J are observed at the range of 350\u2013470 nm. With an increasing of Tb 3+ content, the 5 D 3 \u2013 7 F J transitions decrease gradually, while the 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F J transition increases. When x Tb 3+ \u2265 0.2, the emission peaks of 5 D 3 \u2013 7 F J disappear and only 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F J transitions of Tb 3+ are observed. This phenomenon can be explained by the cross-relaxation between 5 D 3 and 5 D 4 . The variations of PL intensities ( 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F 5 transition of Tb 3+ , \u03bb ex = 235 nm) with different Tb 3+ concentration x are illustrated in Fig. 6 . We can see that the luminescent intensities have wide saturation ranges from x = 0.05 to x = 0.60, and then decrease gradually. Compared with commercial phosphor LaPO 4 :Ce,Tb, the PL intensity of SrGdGa 3 O 7 :Tb is about 10% at optimized Tb 3+ concentration. 3.5 The luminescence decay of Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ emission The decay curves of the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition of Eu 3+ for Sr(Gd 0.995 Eu 0.005 )Ga 3 O 7 and 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F 5 transition of Tb 3+ Sr(Gd 0.995 Tb 0.005 )Ga 3 O 7 were measured. According to our experimental results, either the charge transfer band of Eu 3+ ( \u03bb ex = 256 nm) or the 8 S 7/2 \u2013 6 I 7/2 transition of Gd 3+ ( \u03bb ex = 275 nm) is excited, the two decay curves for Sr(Gd 0.995 Eu 0.005 )Ga 3 O 7 can be well fitted by single exponential equation: I ( t ) = I 0 + A exp(\u2212 t / \u03c4 ), where I and I 0 is the luminescence intensity, A the constant, t the time, \u03c4 the decay time for the exponential components. The \u03c4 extracted from the fitted curve is 1.13 ms for both of the two decay curves. Fig. 7 shows the decay curves of the 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F 5 transition of Tb 3+ under different excitation. When the transition 4f 8 \u20134f 7 5d 1 (f\u2013d transition) is excited, the decay curve is shown in Fig. 7 (a). It can also be fitted by single exponential equation and the value of \u03c4 is 2.3 ms. At room temperature measurement, we do not observe apparently that the Eu 3+ luminescence shows an initial slow rise phenomenon when the excitation wavelength is changed to 275 nm (viz. the position of the Gd 3+ in 8 S 7/2 \u2013 6 I 7/2 transition). However, in the system of Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Tb x )Ga 3 O 7 , the Tb 3+ luminescence shows a slow rise when the excitation wavelength is changed to 275 nm, which is shown in Fig. 7 (b). This curve can be well fitted by the double exponential equation: I ( t ) = I 0 [exp(\u2212 t / \u03c4 1 ) + A exp(\u2212 t / \u03c4 2 )], where I and I 0 is the luminescence intensity, t the time, \u03c4 1 the decay time, \u03c4 2 the decay and/or rise time, A the ratio of the two parts of the function. When A < 0, the second term represents rising, and for A > 0, the second term represents a further decay. The result of the fitting is shown in Fig. 7 (c). The values of parameters are \u03c4 1 = 1.93 ms (decay time), \u03c4 2 = 0.66 ms (rise time) and A = \u22121.59. The initial slow rise is attributed to the finite transfer time involved in the Gd\u2013Tb energy transfer process, which further testifies that there exists energy transfer from Gd to Tb. 4 Conclusion Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Eu x )Ga 3 O 7 and Sr(Gd 1 \u2212 x Tb x )Ga 3 O 7 formed continuous solid solution in the whole range of x = 0\u20131.0. The energy transfer from Gd 3+ to Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ were verified by studying the luminescent properties of SrGdGa 3 O 7 : x Eu 3+ and SrGdGa 3 O 7 : x Tb 3+ . Compared with the commercial phosphors (Y 2 O 3 :Eu, LaPO 4 :Ce,Tb), the PL intensity of SrGdGa 3 O 7 :Eu and SrGdGa 3 O 7 :Tb were about 15% and 10% at optimized Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ concentration, respectively. The Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ lifetime were in the order of microsecond, which were reasonable for the forbidden transition in Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ . The initial slow rise in decay curve further testified that there existed energy transfer from Gd to Tb.

        "abstract": "Novel phosphor of Eu 2+ -doped SrLaGa 3 S 6 O was prepared by solid-state reactions at 900 \u00b0C and H 2 S atmosphere. The excitation and emission spectra of this phosphor showed that all were broadband due to 4f 7 \u20134f 6 5d 1 transitions of Eu 2+ . The phosphors with different Eu 2+ concentrations presented yellowish-green luminescence for both UV and visible excitation (200\u2013500 nm). The concentration quenching mechanism was verified as quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interaction and the value of the critical transfer distance was calculated as 17 \u00c5. The fluorescence lifetime of Eu 2+ was also measured. Keywords Phosphors Chemical synthesis X-ray diffraction Luminescence 1 Introduction Rare-earth ions-doped materials are good candidates for photonic sources. Divalent rare-earth ions Eu 2+ have the 4f 7 electronic configuration of the ground states and the 4f 6 5d 1 electronic configuration of the excited states. The broadband absorption and luminescence of Eu 2+ are due to 4f 7 \u20134f 6 5d 1 transitions and the emission of Eu 2+ is very strongly dependent on the host lattice and can occur from the ultraviolet to the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The 5d\u20134f transition of Eu 2+ is also spin and parity allowed and the lifetime is submicroseconds. In recent years, many investigations of the preparation and the crystal chemistry of melilite families have been performed [1\u201310] . At the same time, their properties have been widely studied. Laser emissions have been observed in SrLaGa 3 O 7 :Er crystal [11] and SrLaGa 3 O 7 :Cr 4+ , Mn 5+ [12] . Ryba-Romanowski et al. [13] have reported the optical properties of Sr X Ga 3 O 7 ( X = La, Gd) doped with Cr 4+ . Kubota and his co-workers have reported the luminescent properties of SrLaGa 3 O 7 crystals doped with Eu 3+ , Tb 3+ and Tm 3+ [14] . Malinowski et al. [15] have studied the spectroscopy properties of Dy 3+ -doped SrLaGa 3 O 7 crystals. Long-lasting phosphorescences have also been reported recently in CaYAl 3 O 7 :Ce 3+ (CYAM) [16,17] , CaYAl 3 O 7 :Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ [18] and CaGdAl 3 O 7 :Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ [18] melilite crystals. Flahaut and co-workers [19] have shown that the thiogallates M LaGa 3 S 7 ( M = Ca, Sr) and La 5/3 Ga 3 S 7 have the structure of melilite. Fouassier has investigated the luminescent properties of Er 3+ in M LaGa 3 S 7 ( M = Ca, Sr) [20] . Today, white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are in high demand in solid-state lighting technology because of their most challenging application as a replacement for conventional incandescent and fluorescent lamps. Currently, we are investigating the chemistry of rare-earth metals with gallium chalcogenides to discover new materials for white LEDs. Presented here are the luminescence data for an oxysulfide doped with Eu 2+ (SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ ), which also has the melilite structure. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a study of such an activator in SrLaGa 3 S 6 O host. 2 Experiment Polycrystalline SrLaGa 3 S 6 O: x Eu compounds were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. The stoichiometric amounts of source materials SrCO 3 (AR), La 2 O 3 (4N), Ga 2 O 3 (4N) and Eu 2 O 3 (4N) were thoroughly mixed by grinding, and then sintered in H 2 S at 900 \u00b0C for 4 h. The phase purity of the as-prepared phosphors was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). The XRD patterns were recorded in the range 10\u00b0 < 2 \u03b8 <70\u00b0 by using a Rigaku RINT220 Diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation at 40 kV, 30 mA. The photoluminescence (PL) emission and excitation spectra of polycrystalline phosphors was measured by a Hitachi F4500 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer and the decay curve of the 4f 6 5d 1 \u2192 4f 7 transition of the Eu 2+ ion in SrLaGa 3 S 6 O were measured by a FLS920-Combined Time Resolved & Steady State Fluorescence Spectrometer (EDINBURGH INSTRUMENTS). All the measurements were carried out at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion The crystal structure of SrLaGa 3 S 6 O has recently been refined to be tetragonal, space group P 4 \u00af 2 1 m with a = 9.374 \u00c5 and c = 6.0893 \u00c5 [1] . The frames of the compounds are formed by five-membered rings constructed from [Ga(O/S) 4 ] 5\u2212 tetrahedral linked at each corner. The Sr 2+ ions and La 3+ ions are surrounded octahedrally by eight anions and are distributed randomly in sites of C s symmetry. The crystal structure of SrLaGa 3 S 6 O is shown in Fig. 1 [1] . The typical powder X-ray diffraction patterns of (Sr 1\u2212 x Eu x )LaGa 3 S 6 O with x = 0.0\u20131.0 are shown in Fig. 2 , which indicates that the doped Eu 2+ ions have little influence on the structure of luminescence materials. Most of the peaks are assigned to the phases of SrLaGa 3 S 6 O (JCPDS file: 39\u2013561). Moreover continuous solid solutions form in the whole range. The calculated lattice parameters are shown in Table 1 . We think that the phases of SrLaGa 3 S 6 O and EuLaGa 3 S 6 O are iso-structural and the detailed structure of EuLaGa 3 S 6 O is under investigation. The excitation and emission spectra of Eu 2+ -doped SrLaGa 3 S 6 O phosphor with 0.10 mol Eu 2+ concentrations are shown in Fig. 3 . The excitation spectrum shows broad bands absorptions from UV to visible light in the range of 200\u2013500 nm. So both UV and visible light could excite this phosphor. No differences are observed for the emission band shape and position for different excitation wavelengths ( \u03bb ex = 275, 330, 400 and 460 nm) except for luminescent intensity. The PL emission spectrum under 460 nm light excitation exhibits a well-known characteristic Eu 2+ emission. The emission band is due to the 4f 6 5d 1 \u20134f 7 transition of the Eu 2+ ion. No other special emission peaks of Eu 3+ are observed in the spectra, which proves that Eu 3+ in the matrix crystals have been reduced to Eu 2+ completely. The maximum wavelength of the emission spectrum is situated at \u03bb max = 540 nm and the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) is 52 nm. All of the phosphors present yellowish-green luminescence for both UV and visible excitation (200\u2013500 nm). The fluorescence spectra of SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphors doped with various concentration of Eu 2+ ( x = 0.02\u20130.70) excited by 460 nm light are shown in Fig. 4 . The dependence of PL intensities of (Sr 1\u2212 x Eu x )LaGa 3 S 6 O on Eu 2+ content is shown in Fig. 5 . The PL intensity increases with Eu 2+ content increasing until a maximum intensity is reached, and then it decreases because of concentration quenching. When the value of x is about 0.10, the maximum of PL intensity occurs. While discussing the mechanism of energy transfer in phosphors, Blasse [21] has pointed out that if the activator is introduced solely on Z ion sites, \u03c7 c is the critical concentration, N the number of Z ions in the unit cell and V the volume of the unit cell, then there is on the average one activator ion per V / \u03c7 c N . The critical transfer distance ( R c ) is approximately equal to twice the radius of a sphere with this volume: (1) R c \u2248 2 3 V 4 \u03c0 x c N 1 / 3 . By taking the experimental and analytic values of V , N and \u03c7 c (535.08 \u00c5 3 , 2, 0.10, respectively), the critical transfer distance of Eu 2+ in SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphor is found to be about 17 \u00c5. Non-radiative energy transfer between different Eu 2+ ions may occur by exchange interaction, radiation reabsorption or multipole\u2013multipole interaction. Eu 2+ is an isolated emission center in SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphor. The 4f 7 \u20134f 6 5d 1 transition of Eu 2+ is allowed while exchange interaction is responsible for the energy transfer for forbidden transitions and typical critical distances are then about 5 \u00c5 [22] . This indicates that the mechanism of exchange interaction plays no role in energy transfer between Eu 2+ ions in SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphor. The mechanism of radiation reabsorption comes into effect only when there is broad overlap of the fluorescent spectra of the sensitizer and activator and in the view of the emission and excitation spectra of SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphor is unlikely to be occurring in the case. Since the fluorescent mechanism of Eu 2+ in SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphor is the 4f\u20135d allowed electric-dipole transition, the process of energy transfer should be controlled by electric multipole\u2013multipole interaction according to Dexter's theory [22] . If the energy transfer occurs between the same sorts of activators, the intensity of multipolar interaction can be determined from the change of the emission intensity from the emitting level which has the multipolar interaction. The emission intensity ( I ) per activator ion follows the equation [23,24] : (2) I / x = K 1 + \u03b2 x Q / 3 \u2212 1 Where \u03c7 is the activator concentration; Q = 6, 8 or 10 for dipole\u2013dipole, dipole\u2013quadrupole or quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interaction, respectively; and K and \u03b2 are constant for the same excitation condition for a given host crystal. Since the critical concentration of Eu 2+ has been determined as 10%, the dependence of the emission intensity of the SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphor excited at 460 nm on the corresponding concentration of Eu 2+ which is not less than the critical concentration (10%) is determined (see Fig. 6 ). It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the dependence of log( I / \u03c7 Eu 2+ ) on log( \u03c7 Eu 2+ ) is linear and the line slope is \u22123.42. The value of Q can be calculated as 10.25, which is approximately equal to 10. It indicates that quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interaction is the concentration quenching mechanism of Eu 2+ emission in the SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphor. Fluorescence decay curve for the 4f 6 5d 1 \u2192 4f 7 transition of the Eu 2+ ion in (Sr 0.96 Eu 0.04 )LaGa 3 S 6 O is shown in Fig. 7 . The decay curve can be well fitted by double exponential equation: I ( t ) = I 0 + A exp( \u2212t / \u03c4 1 ) + B exp( \u2212t/\u03c4 2 ), where I and I 0 is the luminescence intensity, A and B are constants, t is the time, \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 are the decay time for the exponential components, respectively. The \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 extracted from the fitted curve are 1.44 and 13.74 \u03bcs, respectively. 4 Conclusion Novel phosphor of Eu 2+ -doped SrLaGa 3 S 6 O was prepared by solid-state reactions at 900 \u00b0C and H 2 S atmosphere. The excitation and emission spectra of these phosphors show that all are broadband, which can be viewed as the typical emission of Eu 2+ ascribed to the 4f\u20135d transitions. All of the phosphors present yellowish-green luminescence for both UV and visible excitation in the range of 200\u2013500 nm. Because of their broadband absorption in the region 380\u2013480 nm, these phosphors meet the application requirements for GaN-based LEDs. The critical quenching concentration of Eu 2+ in SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphor is determined as 10%. According to the refinement results of lattice microstructure, the critical transfer distance is calculated to be about 17 \u00c5. By the experimental and theoretical calculation, it is identified that the mechanism of concentration quenching of Eu 2+ in SrLaGa 3 S 6 O:Eu 2+ phosphor is quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interaction. The fluorescence lifetime of the 4f 6 5d 1 \u2192 4f 7 transition of the Eu 2+ ion in (Sr 0.96 Eu 0.04 )LaGa 3 S 6 O is measured. The fluorescence decay curve can be well fitted by double exponential equation and the \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 are 1.44 and 13.47 \u03bcs, respectively.

The observed up-conversion emissions include intense blue 1G4\u21923H6(482 nm) transition and other weak transitions: 1D2\u21923H6(367 nm), 1G4\u21923F4(651 nm) and 1G4\u21923H5(776 nm). The concentration quenching of Tm3+ or Yb3+ is obvious at higher concentration due to the cross-relaxation. The optimum doping levels are 10% Yb3+ and 0.2%-0.4% Tm3+ for blue emission. Power studies reveal that the blue emission of Tm3+ ion results from three-photon processes, which require three energy transfers from Yb3+ to excite Tm3+ from 3H6 to 1G4 in succession.",

The dependences of these emissions as function of the pumping power intensities and the doped rare-earth ion concentrations are described. The results indicate that the green and red emission of Er 3+ ion result from two-photon excitation processes, and the violet emission of Er 3+ ion from three-photon processes. The most efficient composition for green emission is 2\u20134 mol% Er 3+ and 10\u201320 mol% Yb 3+ in synthesized samples.

XRD patterns indicated that the phosphors are of single phase; the relationship between lattice constant and compositional ratio x is linear, in which the Vegard's law holds. The excitation spectra are consistent with diffuse reflectance spectra, indicating that the energy absorbed by phosphor can be transferred to Eu2+ efficiently. The excitation spectra of these phosphors show broadband, extending from UV to visible light; and they can be matched with the emission wavelength of GaN chip well. The emission spectra exhibit characteristic 4f65d1\u21924f7 transition of Eu2+ ion. With increasing x the emission band shifted to shorter wavelength, which can be explained by the change in crystal field. The decay curve of fluorescence can be well fitted by double exponential equation, and the lifetime of Eu2+ is of the order of microsecond. The lifetimes are reasonable for the allowed 4f65d1\u21924f7 transition. The electroluminescence spectra of red LED manufactured with phosphors Sr(S1-xSex):Eu2+ were measured and the parameters of them were also measured.

Keywords Phosphors Solid state reactions Optical properties Luminescence Time-resolved optical spectroscopies 1 Introduction Recently, high quality phosphors have attracted more attention due to their practical application in the fields of display, X-ray screens, fluorescent lamps, solid state lighting, and so on [1\u20138] . Rare earth ions have been playing an important role in the phosphor materials due to their abundant emission colors based on their 4f\u20134f or 5d\u20134f transitions [9] . Among them, the emission spectrum of Tb 3+ ion often shows an intense line emission near 544 nm arising from the 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 transition [10\u201314] . So Tb 3+ activated \u201cgreen\u201d phosphors are combined with Eu 2+ activated blue phosphors and Eu 3+ activated red phosphors to provide \u201ctrichromatic\u201d lighting technology, a high-efficiency white light for standard illumination uses in indoor lighting [15] . Borates are good matrix for rare earth ions activated phosphors due to their low synthesis temperature, easy preparation and high luminescence efficiency [3,16\u201319] . The stoichiometric formula of borates MM\u2032 4 (BO 3 ) 3 (where M = Li + , Na + or K + and M\u2032 = Ca 2+ , Sr 2+ or Ba 2+ ) have been reported by Wu et al. MM\u2019 4 (BO 3 ) 3 belongs to orthorhombic or cubic structure depending on the kind of cations [20,21] . Recently, these kinds of compounds attract more attention due to their potential application [3,20,21] . However, the PL properties of Tb 3+ in these matrixes have not been reported. In this paper, the NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 : x Tb 3+ phosphors have been prepared by solid-state reaction, and the PL and time-resolved luminescence properties were also investigated in detail. 2 Experimental NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 : x Tb 3+ samples were prepared according to the standard solid-state technique [21] . High-purity starting materials Na 2 CO 3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), BaCO 3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), H 3 BO 3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), and Tb 4 O 7 (Aldrich, 99.99%) were used. The well mixed materials were annealed at 700 \u00b0C for 12 h in CO weak reducing atmosphere with an intermediate grinding. Na + was added as a charge compensator. The structural characteristics of samples were checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns using a Philips XPert/MPD diffraction system with Cu K\u03b1 ( \u03bb = 0.154 05 nm) radiation. All the samples are single phase. The PL emission and excitation spectra were measured by Fluorolog-3 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with 450 W Xenon lamps. The luminescence decays were measured by monitoring the given emission from the samples under 266 nm pulsed laser excitation. Decay profiles were recorded by the 500 MHz digital oscilloscope (LeCroy 9350A) in which the signal was fed from PMT. 3 Results and discussion The PL emission and excitation spectra of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :0.10Tb 3+ phosphor are shown in Fig. 1 . The sharp excitation lines at 317, 350, 370, 377, and 485 nm are observed from the excitation spectrum of the 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 transition. These excitation lines can be ascribed to the transitions from 7 F 6 to 5 D J , 5 G J , 5 L 10 , 5 D 3 , and 5 D 4 , respectively. The excitation band near 300 nm could be ascribed to the Tb 3+ 4f 8 \u2192 4f 7 5d 1 transition. In addition, NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 : x Tb 3+ phosphors show intense f \u2192 f transition absorption, which may be attributed to the uneven components mix a small amount of opposite parity wave functions (e.g., 5d) into the 4f wave functions; so the parity selection rule is relaxed [9] . Tb 3+ ion with 4f 8 configuration has complicated energy levels, so luminescence spectrum consisting of many lines due to 5 D J \u2192 7 F J\u2019 is observed. The emission spectrum of the NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :0.10Tb 3+ sample under 375 nm UV excitation shows the 5 D 3 \u2192 7 F J as well as the 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F J emission lines. Among the emission lines, the 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 emission line at about 540 nm is the strongest one. The reason is that this transition has the largest probability for both electric-dipole and magnetic-dipole induced transitions [15] . However, the relative intensity of 5 D 3 emission is much weaker than that of 5 D 4 emission even in the sample with lower Tb 3+ concentration (0.1 mol%). It is well known that the intensity ratio of the emission from 5 D 3 to that from 5 D 4 depends not only on the Tb 3+ concentration [22\u201324] , but also on the host material [15] . In borate hosts, the relative intensity of 5 D 3 emission is much weaker than that in other hosts, such as phosphates, silicates, and aluminates [25\u201327] , which maybe have a relation to the energy of phonons [15] . The Tb 3+ concentration dependence on intensity of 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 transition has also been investigated. The intensity increases with increasing Tb 3+ concentration, and the concentration quenching does not take place even if Tb 3+ concentration x is equal to 10 mol% (i.e., NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :0.10Tb 3+ ). Fig. 2 depicts the decay curves of 5 D 3 \u2192 7 F 5 transition of Tb 3+ under excitation at 266 nm laser light. For the lower concentration ( x = 0.005), the decay is nearly exponential with a time constant of about 35 \u03bcs. As Tb 3+ concentration increases, the initial part of the curves becomes non-exponential and the time constants decrease gradually ( \u03c4 = 22 \u03bcs for x = 0.10). The possible reason could be that the 5 D 3 \u2192 5 D 4 cross-relaxation produces a marked increase in the 5 D 3 decay rate with increasing Tb 3+ concentrations and introduces a non-exponential component into the initial part of the decay [28] . For the decay of 5 D J \u2192 7 F J transition, the rigorous migration effect is found in the 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 decay, whereas no energy migration could be found in the 5 D 3 \u2192 7 F 5 decay [29] . So energy migration can be neglected. In order to determine the interactions responsible for the non-radiative relaxation from the 5 D 3 level, the decay analysis of 5 D 3 \u2192 7 F 5 transition can be carried out on employing the direct energy transfer based on the well known Inokuti\u2013Hirayama model [30] . (1) I ( t ) I 0 = exp \u2212 t \u03c4 0 \u2212 C C 0 \u0393 1 \u2212 3 S t \u03c4 0 3 S where \u03c4 0 is the radiative lifetime of an isolated excited Tb 3+ ion, \u0393 (1 \u2212 3/ S ) is Euler's gamma function, C is acceptor ion concentration, C 0 is critical concentration defined as 3 / ( 4 \u03c0 R 0 3 ) and S is the multipole interaction parameter. Many papers have reported that a dipole\u2013dipole interaction is found to be responsible for the cross-relaxation at room temperature [28,29,31,32] . In the case of dipole\u2013dipole interaction, the value of S is 6, and \u0393 (1 \u2212 3/ S ) = 1.77. The fit of the decay curves of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 : x Tb 3+ samples regarding dipole-dipole interaction indicates that the best agreement between experimental data and theoretical fits is obtained. The fitted results of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 : x Tb 3+ ( x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.10) samples are given in Table 1 . The \u03c4 0 value is about 70 \u03bcs for 5 D 3 \u2192 7 F 5 transition of isolated Tb 3+ ions in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Tb 3+ . The critical distance for the d\u2013d interaction is found to be about 10 \u00c5. The decay curves of 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 transition of Tb 3+ under excitation at 266 nm pulsed laser are represented in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the decay curves show a nearly single exponential decay and does not vary obviously with increasing Tb 3+ concentration. A single exponential fit yields a decay time 1.9 ms. The lifetimes of 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 transition do not change indicating that concentration quenching does not happen within the range of Tb 3+ contents. Hao et al. has also observed similar phenomenon in CaSc 2 O 4 :Tb 3+ phosphor [24] . Moreover, it is noted that the decay curves of 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 transition exhibit an initial rise phenomenon (marked with red circle in Fig. 3 ). We attempted to fit these curves with double exponential equation [22,33] : (2) I ( t ) = I 0 exp \u2212 t \u03c4 1 + A exp \u2212 t \u03c4 2 where I and I 0 is the luminescence intensity, t is the time, \u03c4 1 is a decay time, \u03c4 2 is a decay and/or rise time, A is the ratio of the two parts of the function. When A < 0, the second term represents rising, and for A > 0, the second term represents a further decay. The results of the fitting indicate that the best agreement between experimental data and theoretical fits is obtained. The result of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :0.005Tb 3+ sample is shown in Fig. 4 . The values of parameters are \u03c4 1 = 1.89 ms (decay time), \u03c4 2 = 40 \u03bcs (rise time) and A = \u22120.7833. The initial slow rise with initial intensity (40%) of the 5 D 4 emission is due to the feeding process of the 5 D 4 population. It is fed about 40% of the 5 D 4 population from nearby Tb 3+ ions through the fast cross-relaxation process between Tb 3+ ( 5 D 4 \u2192 5 D 3 ) and Tb 3+ ( 7 F 6 \u2192 7 F 0 ) [32] . On the other hand, 60% of 5 D 4 population comes directly by non-radiative relaxation process from the 5 D 3 level having decay time of about 40 \u03bcs corresponding to the rise time of the 5 D 4 level. 4 Conclusions In NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 : x Tb 3+ , the intense f \u2192 f transition absorption is observed comparing with the major Tb-doped phosphors; the 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 transition at 540 nm is the strongest emission, and the relative intensity of 5 D 3 emission is much weaker than that of 5 D 4 emission even in the sample with lower Tb 3+ concentration. The decay curves of 5 D 3 \u2192 7 F 5 transition can be well fitted by Inokuti\u2013Hirayama model, and the dipole-dipole interaction is responsible for the cross-relaxation. The derived critical distance for the d\u2013d interaction is 10 \u00c5. The decay curves of 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 5 transition can be fitted by double exponential function, indicating that the initial slow rise with 40% of initial intensity of the 5 D 4 emission is attributed to the feedings from higher energy levels and the cross-relaxation process between two Tb 3+ ions.

It shows an efficient broad absorption band around 400 nm, which matches well with the commercial near-ultraviolet light-emitting chips, and an efficient blue emission. It shows a higher thermal quenching temperature than that of Sr3Al2O5Cl2:Eu2+ phosphor. Sr3Ga2O5Cl2:Eu2+ phosphor is a promising blue-emitting component for UV chip excited white light-emitting-diodes. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

All spectra consist of the relatively broad green and the red emission bands, which thus result in a warm-white color with a color temperature of \u223c4000 K. With increasing Eu2+ ions at fixed Mn2+ concentrations, a strong correlation between the luminescence and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra is observed. This demonstrates that Eu2+ doping causes a perturbation of Mn2+ sites and the violation of their selection rules that enhances Mn2+-related emissions. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Ce 3+ shows an emission band peaking at 420 nm under 350-nm UV excitation. Energy transfer from Ce 3+ to Mn2+ takes place in the co-doped samples. Eu 3+ shows red emission under near UV excitation. LiSr 4(BO 3) 3:Eu 3+ phosphor could be a suitable candidate for phosphor-converted solid state lighting. The luminescence lifetime is 2.13 ms for Eu 3+ in LiSr 4(BO 3) 3:0.001Eu 3+. As Eu 3+ concentration increasing, the decay curves deviate from exponential behavior. Tb 3+ shows the strongest 5D 4\u2192 7F 5 emission line at 540 nm. Decay curves of 5D 4\u2192 7F 5 and 5D 3\u2192 7F 5 emission with different Tb 3+ concentrations were also measured. Cross-relaxation process is discussed based on the decay curves. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",

        "abstract": "Novel Eu 3+ , Ce 3+ activated NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 phosphors were synthesized by solid-state reactions. The excitation spectrum of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Ce 3+ consists of an intense band peaking at 350 nm and a weak band in the higher energy side, and the emission spectrum exhibits a blue band with a maximum at about 420 nm. The Eu 3+ emission in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 consists of the transitions from 5 D 0 to 7 F J , and the excitation spectrum consists of broad excitation band peaking at 270 nm and some intense narrow lines. The optimum doped concentration, the critical distance of the concentration quenching, and the fluorescence lifetime have also been investigated. Keywords Phosphors Luminescence Borates Decay 1 Introduction Rare earth ions activated phosphors have numerous applications in the fields of display, lighting, and medical industries [1\u20134] . Recently, phosphor converted white light-emitting-diodes (LEDs), with characteristics of high efficiency, long lifetime, and energy saving, have attracted great attention [5\u201311] . With the emission of chip shifting toward near-UV region, more and more attention has been paid to the development of new phosphors, which can be excited efficiently in the near-UV range [12\u201316] . Among rare earth ions, the photoluminescence (PL) properties of Ce and Eu ions in borates have been studied widely due to their application in the fields of lamps and display devices [17\u201319] . The emission of Ce 3+ consists of a broad band with two peaks, which is due to the transitions from 5d to the ground state ( 2 F 5/2 and 2 F 7/2 ). The d\u2013f transition is an allowed electric dipole transition and therefore the decay time of the fluorescence is short (<10 \u22127 s) enough to be applied in the field of lamps and display. The emission of Eu 3+ ion in 4f shell is insensitive to the influence of the surroundings due to the shielding effect of 5s and 5p electrons. The luminescence properties of Eu 3+ ions are strongly related to their chemical and structural environment inside the matrix [11,20\u201324] . Among the most investigated matrices for rare earth activated phosphors, i.e., oxides, silicates, phosphates, aluminates, and borates, borates are good candidates due to their low synthesis temperature, easy preparation, and high luminescence efficiency. Hence borates have attracted more attention [3,18,25\u201328] . Recently, novel borates with the composition of MM\u2032 4 (BO 3 ) 3 (M=Li, Na, and K; M\u2032=Ca, Sr, and Ba) were synthesized and their crystal structures were refined recently [29,30] . Jiang et al. [31\u201333] studied the synthesis, PL, thermoluminescence, and dosimetry properties of novel phosphors (NaSr 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Ce 3+ , KSr 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Ce 3+ ) under \u03b2-ray irradiation. However, the PL properties of these materials have not been investigated widely. This prompted us to study the fluorescence properties of rare earth ions in these borates. Recently we studied the PL properties of a novel Eu 3+ excited phosphor, which emits in the visible, viz., NaCa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Eu 3+ [3] . In this paper, we report the PL properties of Eu 3+ and Ce 3+ in the NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 crystal for the first time. 2 Experimental Samples of NaBa 4\u22122 x (BO 3 ) 3 : x Eu 3+ , x Na + , NaBa 4\u22122 x (BO 3 ) 3 : x Ce 3+ , x Na + were synthesized according to the standard solid-state technique [29] . High-purity starting materials Na 2 CO 3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), BaCO 3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), H 3 BO 3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), Eu 2 O 3 (Aldrich, 99.99%), and CeO 2 (Aldrich, 99.99%) were used. The well mixed materials were annealed at 700 \u00b0C for 12 h in air with an intermediate grinding. Na + was added as a charge compensator. The structural characteristics of samples were checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns using a Philips XPert/MPD diffraction system with CuK \u03b1 ( \u03bb =0.154 05 nm) radiation. All the samples are single phase. The PL emission and excitation spectra were performed at room temperature using a spectrometer (Photo Technology International) with a 150 W Xe lamp as an excitation source. The luminescence decays were measured by monitoring the given emission from the samples under 355 or 266 nm pulsed laser excitation. Decay profiles were recorded with a LeCloy 9301 digital storage oscilloscope in which the signal was fed from PMT. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 PL properties of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Ce 3+ phosphor Fig. 1 shows the PL excitation and emission spectra of NaBa 3.92 (BO 3 ) 3 :0.04Ce 3+ , 0.04Na + . The excitation spectrum consists of an intense band peaking at 350 nm and a weak one in the higher energy side. These bands are assigned to the 5d crystal field components of Ce 3+ in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 . The emission spectrum exhibits a blue band with a maximum at about 420 nm. This emission band can be deconvoluted into two bands peaking at 410 and 445 nm, respectively. The two bands can be attributed to the transitions from lowest 5d excited state to 2 F 5/2 and 2 F 7/2 ground state. The calculated 2 F J ( J =7/2, 5/2) energy gap of Ce 3+ in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 is about 1920 cm \u22121 , which is consistent with the 2 F J ( J =7/2, 5/2) energy gap of Ce 3+ (\u223c2000 cm \u22121 ) in most Ce 3+ -activated phosphors [34] . In addition, it is noted that the peak wavelength of PL emission band of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Ce 3+ is shorter than that of NaSr 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Ce 3+ (425 nm); this is expected and the blue shift can be explained by a decreased crystal field splitting for Ce 3+ on the larger Ba 2+ cation site [20] . The Ce 3+ concentration dependence on emission intensity in NaBa 4\u22122 x (BO 3 ) 3 : x Ce 3+ , x Na + system was investigated and the result is shown in the inset of Fig. 1 . It can be seen that the emission intensity increases with increase in Ce 3+ concentration. When the value of x is greater than 0.04, the intensity decreases because of concentration quenching. The critical distance ( R 0 ) of concentration quenching can be calculated using the following formula [35] : (1) R 0 \u2248 2 ( 3 V 4 \u03c0 x c N ) 1 / 3 where x c is the critical concentration at which quenching occurs, N the number of Ba 2+ ions in the NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 unit cell, and V the volume of the unit cell. By taking the experimental and analytic data of x c , N , and V (0.04, 16, and 3949.69(6) \u00c5 3 , respectively), the critical transfer distance of Ce 3+ in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Ce 3+ phosphors is about 23 \u00c5. The luminescence lifetimes of Ce 3+ in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Ce 3+ with different concentrations were measured. All decay curves show a close to single exponential behavior. Fig. 2 shows the decay curve of NaBa 3.92 (BO 3 ) 3 :0.04Ce 3+ ,0.04Na + under 355 nm laser excitation. The derived lifetime from the decay curve is about 30 ns. The d\u2013f transition of Ce 3+ is an allowed electric dipole transition; therefore the decay time of the fluorescence is in the order of nanosecond [20] . 3.2 PL properties of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 :Eu 3+ phosphor Eu 3+ doped NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 phosphors show red emission at room temperature under ultraviolet excitation. Fig. 3 shows the PL emission and excitation spectra of NaBa 3.40 (BO 3 ) 3 :0.30 Eu 3+ ,0.30Na + . Under 270 and 392 nm excitation, the emission spectra consist of the well-known transitions from the 5 D 0 level to the lower 7 F manifold. The emission peaks observed at 575, 590, 610, 650, and 700 nm can be assigned to the transition 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 0 , 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 , 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 , 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 3 , and 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 4 , respectively. The intensity of 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 (electric dipole\u2013dipole transition) is stronger than that of 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 (magnetic dipole\u2013dipole), which indicates that Eu 3+ ions occupy asymmetric sites [20] . The crystal structure of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 has been determined from powder X-ray diffraction data [29] . NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 crystallizes in the cubic space group Ia 3 \u00af d with large lattice parameters: a =15.80719(8) \u00c5. Ba atoms have two different sites in the unit cell: one is centrosymmetric (16a) and the other is noncentrosymmetric (48f). Therefore, we conclude that the doped Eu 3+ ions prefer to replace the Ba 2+ ions in the 48f position in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 . The excitation spectrum monitored at 610 nm consists of broad excitation band peaking at 270 nm and some intense narrow lines. The excitation band could be attributed to the charge transfer (CT) transition between O 2\u2212 and Eu 3+ . The narrow lines are attributed to the typical Eu 3+ f\u2013f transitions, including 7 F 0 \u2013 5 H J (318 nm), 7 F 0 \u2013 5 L 6 (396 nm), 7 F 0 \u2013 5 D 2 (465 nm), 7 F 0 \u2013 5 D 1 (524 nm), and 7 F 1 \u2013 5 D 1 (533 nm). The emission intensity dependence on the Eu 3+ concentration has been investigated. The emission intensity of phosphors increases with increase in Eu 3+ concentration; the concentration quenching does not take place even if x =0.30 in the NaBa 4\u22122 x (BO 3 ) 3 : x Eu 3+ , x Na + system, which is depicted in the inset of Fig. 4 . The fluorescence decay curves with pulsed excitation at 266 nm are examined in terms of Eu 3+ concentration, and they are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the decay curves change from exponential to non-exponential with increase in Eu 3+ content. For x <0.08, the decay curves are in the form of single exponential decay and the change in decay time with Eu 3+ concentration can be ignored. The fitted lifetime is about 1.4 ms. The deviation from the single exponential behavior could be attributed to the nonradiative process [36] . The mechanisms of concentration quenching and decay behavior are under investigation. 4 Conclusions The PL properties of NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 doped with Eu 3+ , Ce 3+ phosphors were investigated. The excitation spectrum of Ce 3+ doped NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 consists of an intense band peaking at 350 nm and a weak band in the higher energy side, and the emission spectrum exhibits a blue band with a maximum at about 420 nm. The 2 F J ( J =7/2, 5/2) energy gap of Ce 3+ in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 is 1920 cm \u22121 . The optimum concentration of Ce 3+ is 4 mol%. The lifetime of Ce 3+ is 30 ns. The Eu 3+ emission in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 consists of the transitions from 5 D 0 to 7 F J , and the Eu 3+ ion prefers to replace the Ba 2+ in the 48f position in NaBa 4 (BO 3 ) 3 . The excitation spectrum consists of broad excitation band peaking at 270 nm and some intense narrow lines. The lifetime of Eu 3+ is about 1.4 ms. The decay curves\u2019 deviation from the single exponential behavior is due to the nonradiative process.

        "abstract": "Blue-emitting Ca2B5O9Cl:Eu2+ phosphors have been synthesized by solid state reaction. The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra show broad-band absorptions and can match the emission of near ultraviolet (n-UV) chip well. At lower Eu2+ concentration, the emission band can be resolved into two bands, which is assigned to the 5d\u21924f transition of Eu2+ ions substituting two different Ca 2+ sites. At higher Eu2+ concentration, the energy transfer from Eu(1) to Eu(2) happens and is very efficient. At higher temperature the phosphor exhibits a lower temperature quenching effect. The fluorescence lifetimes are short enough for application in solid-state lighting. The electroluminescence spectrum indicates that the emission of chip can almost be absorbed by phosphor and down-converted into an intensive blue light. The chromaticity coordinates of fabricated light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) is very close to that of BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ (BAM). Ca2B5O9Cl:Eu2+ is a good blue component phosphor for n-UV excited solid-state lighting. \u00a9 2009 The American Ceramic Society.",

        "abstract": "Orange-emissive Ce3+/Eu2+ co-doped Sr3Al2O5Cl2 phosphors were synthesized by a solid-state reaction. The large overlap between the emission spectrum of blue Sr3Al2O5Cl2:Ce3+ and the excitation spectrum of orange Sr3Al2O5Cl2:Eu2+, and the shortening trend in lifetime of Ce3+ donors with increasing Eu2+ concentration in Sr3Al2O5Cl2:Ce3+, Eu2+ provide the strong evidence of energy transfer from Ce3+ to Eu2+ ions. It supports that the orange emission intensity of the optimal co-doped phosphor is 1.5 times stronger than that of single Eu2+-doped one. The Sr3Al2O5Cl2:Ce3+, Eu2+ phosphor is a promising orange-emitting phosphor for warm-white-light-emitting diode because of its effective excitation in the near ultraviolet range. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Luminescence properties of the Sm 3+ , Dy 3+ doped LaMoBO 6 phosphors are reported. LaMoBO 6 :Sm 3+ exhibits orange emission corresponding to the 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 transition. LaMoBO 6 :Dy 3+ exhibits two emission bands. The yellow band (570 nm) corresponds to the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 transition, and the blue one (482 nm) corresponds to the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 transition. The optimum concentration of Sm 3+ and Dy 3+ , the critical distance of the concentration quenching, and the decay curves have also been investigated. The analysis of the decay curves indicates that cross-relaxation is primarily responsible for the concentration quenching. Keywords Phosphors Solid state reactions Optical properties Luminescence 1 Introduction Luminescence materials are important for modern technology because of their ability to convert electromagnetic radiation (i.e., UV and IR light) into visible light [1] . Recently, the development of rare earth (RE) ions activated novel luminescent materials have attracted more attention due to their potential applications in different optical display systems [2\u20139] . Because the 4f electrons of RE ions are shielded by the outer 5s and 5p electrons, the intra-4f emission spectra of RE ions are characterized by narrow lines with high color purity. The emission of Sm 3+ is situated in the orange spectral region and consists of transitions from the excited 4 G 5/2 level to the ground state 6 H 5/2 and higher levels 6 H J ( J > 5/2) [10\u201312] . The luminescence lines of Dy 3+ are in the 480 nm region (blue) due to the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 transition, and in the 570 nm region (yellow) due to the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 transition. The influence of the crystal structure on the yellow intensity is greater than that on the blue intensity. As the crystal structure is changed, the blue to yellow intensity ratio (B/Y) of Dy 3+ emission will change [13] . The color of the luminescence is close to white if a suitable ratio of B/Y obtained. Therefore, Dy 3+ doped materials may be potential two primary color phosphors [12,14,15] . Recently, molybdates and tungstates with scheelite structure are considered as good host lattices under near-UV or blue excitation due to their MoO 4 tetrahedron and WO 4 unit [16\u201320] . LaMoBO 6 belongs to monoclinic structure. The molybdenum atoms are trigonal bipyramidally coordinated by five oxygen atoms, forming an infinite (MoO 4 ) 2\u2212 anionic chain by corner-sharing O atoms down the b -axis [21] . Our former investigation on LaMoBO 6 :Eu 3+ phosphor indicates that the Eu 3+ site in this compound lacks inversion symmetry [4] . Su et al. reported that when Dy 3+ is located at a site of high symmetry with an inverse center, Dy 3+ displays no luminescence, and the B/Y of Dy 3+ located at a site deviated from an inverse center is less than that of Dy 3+ located at a site without an inverse center [13] . To the best of our knowledge, the luminescence properties of RE ions doped LaMoBO 6 phosphors have not been reported widely. In this work the photoluminescence (PL) properties of Sm 3+ and Dy 3+ activated LaMoBO 6 phosphors are presented as well as their concentration dependence. 2 Experimental La 1\u2212 x Sm x MoBO 6 and La 1\u2212 x Dy x MoBO 6 phosphors were prepared according to standard solid-state technique. High-purity starting materials La 2 O 3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 \u00b74H 2 O (Aldrich, 99.9%), H 3 BO 3 (Aldrich, 99.99%, 10 mol% excess to compensate the evaporation in the heating processes), Sm 2 O 3 (Aldrich, 99.99%) and Dy 2 O 3 (Aldrich, 99.99%) were used. The well mixed materials were annealed at 800 \u00b0C for 12 h in air with an intermediate grinding. The structural characteristics of samples were examined from X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max 2200 Diffractometer (Rigaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Ka radiation at 40 kV, 30 mA. The PL emission and excitation spectra were performed at room temperature using Fluorolog-3 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon Inc., France) with 450W Xenon lamps. The luminescence decays were measured by monitoring the given emission from the samples under 355 nm pulsed laser excitation. Decay profiles were recorded with a LeCroy 9301 digital storage oscilloscope (LeCroy Corp., NY) in which the signal was fed from PMT. The photoluminescence quantum yield was measured by a 4 Port 150 mm BaSO 4 coated integrating sphere which fits directly into the FSP920 (Edinburgh Instruments) sample chamber. FSP920 Time Resolved and Steady State Fluorescence Spectrometers (Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp, TM300 excitation monochromator and double TM300 emission monochromators and Red PMT. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure characterization The crystal structure of LaMoBO 6 compound has been investigated by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction recently. LaMoBO 6 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P 2 1 / c with the lattice parameters: a = 10.2968(8), b = 4.1636(3), and c = 23.8587(15) \u00c5 [21] . The XRD patterns of La 0.90 Sm 0.10 MoBO 6 and La 0.90 Dy 0.10 MoBO 6 phosphors are shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) . All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to pure monoclinic structured LaMoBO 6 (JCPDS card no. 37-1100) except for some impurity phase detected in La 0.90 Dy 0.10 MoBO 6 sample. Because the electric charges of La 3+ , Sm 3+ , and Dy 3+ are identical and the radii of them are close ( r La = 0.127 nm, r Sm \u2248 0.113 nm, r Dy \u2248 0.108 nm, coordination number (CN) = 10) [22] , the doped Sm 3+ , Dy 3+ ions can substitute the La 3+ sites easily. 3.2 Luminescence properties of LaMoBO 6 doped with Sm 3+ The PL excitation and emission spectra of La 0.99 Sm 0.01 MoBO 6 are shown in Fig. 2 . The excitation bands peaking at 363, 376, 404, 439 and 465 nm are assigned to the transitions of 6 H 5/2 \u2192 6 P 5/2 , 4 L 17/2 , 4 F 7/2 , 4 I 15/2 and 4 I 11/2 , respectively [15] . The 6 H 5/2 \u2192 4 F 7/2 transition is the strongest excitation band. In addition, no obvious charge transfer (CT) band due to O 2\u2212 \u2192 Sm 3+ or host related absorption band are observed in Fig. 1 (a) except the direct excitation of Sm 3+ ions. Upon excitation at 404 nm, the La 0.99 Sm 0.01 MoBO 6 phosphor shows an orange luminescence, and the obtained emission spectrum consists of f \u2192 f transition lines within Sm 3+ 4f 5 electron configuration, i.e., 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 (563 nm), 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 (597 nm), 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 9/2 (645 nm), and 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 11/2 (708 nm), respectively. The strongest one is located at 597 nm, corresponding to the 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 transition of Sm 3+ . However, the quantum efficiency of 404-nm excited luminescence of La 0.99 Sm 0.01 MoBO 6 is only 15%. Fig. 3 shows the Sm 3+ concentration dependence on emission intensity of La 1\u2212 x Sm x MoBO 6 phosphors. It can be seen that the emission intensity increases with increasing Sm 3+ concentration, and the maximum intensity approaches when the value of x is equal to 0.01, then the PL intensity decreases because of concentration quenching. The critical distance ( R 0 ) from the concentration quenching data can be calculated using the following formula [23] (1) R 0 \u2248 2 \u00d7 3 V 4 \u03c0 x C N 1 / 3 where x c is the critical concentration at which the quenching occurs, N is the number of La 3+ ions in the LaMoBO 6 unit cell, and V is the volume of the unit cell. By taking the experimental and analytic values of x c , N and V (0.01, 8, 924.24 \u00c5 3 , respectively), the critical transfer distance of Sm 3+ in La 1\u2212 x Sm x MoBO 6 phosphors is determined to be about 28 \u00c5. 3.3 Luminescence properties of LaMoBO 6 doped with Dy 3+ The excitation spectrum of La 0.995 Dy 0.005 MoBO 6 phosphor is shown in Fig. 4 (a) . The excitation bands at 353, 366, 389, 427 and 452 nm are assigned to the electronic transitions of 6 H 15/2 \u2192 ( 4 M, 4 I) 15/2 , 4 I 11/2 , 4 I 13/2 , 4 G 11/2 and 4 I 15/2 , respectively due to f \u2192 f transitions of Dy 3+ [15] . Among them the intensity of 6 H 15/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition at 452 nm is the most intense one. In addition, it is interesting to note from Fig. 4 (b) that for each sample the intensity of 6 H 15/2 \u2192 4 I 13/2 transition become stronger than that of 6 H 15/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transition with increasing Dy 3+ concentration. Like in the previous case, the host related or O 2\u2212 \u2192 Dy 3+ CT band has not been observed in the short wavelength range. The emission spectrum of La 0.995 Dy 0.005 MoBO 6 ( \u03bb ex = 388 nm) is shown in Fig. 5 (a) . Two emission bands are observed. The yellow band (570 nm) corresponds to the hypersensitive transition 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 (\u0394 L = 2, \u0394 J = 2), and the blue band (482 nm) corresponds to the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 transition. The value of B/Y (\u223c0.5) does not vary much with increasing Dy 3+ content (shown in the inset of Fig. 5 (a)), which is consistent with other Dy 3+ doped luminescent materials [13] . The Dy 3+ content dependences on the emission intensity of 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 and 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 transitions are shown in Fig. 5 (b). Both of them show similar tendency with increasing Dy 3+ content. The optimum Dy 3+ concentration is 4 mol%. However, the intensity is not strong, and the quantum efficiency of 452-nm excited luminescence of La 0.96 Dy 0.04 MoBO 6 is only 10%. The critical distance ( R 0 ) calculated from Eq. (1) is about 18 \u00c5. 3.4 Fluorescence decay spectra The luminescence decay curves of the emission transition 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 at 597 nm (Sm 3+ in La 1\u2212 x Sm x MoBO 6 ) and that of the emission transition 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 at 570 nm (Dy 3+ in La 1\u2212 x Dy x MoBO 6 ) with a laser excitation at 355 nm are shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), respectively. It can be seen that the decay curves are single exponential in the diluted samples. The luminescence lifetimes calculated from the fitted curves are 1.33 ms for Sm 3+ in La 0.995 Sm 0.005 MoBO 6 and 0.53 ms for Dy 3+ in La 0.995 Dy 0.005 MoBO 6 . As concentration increases, the decay curves deviate from exponential behavior, and the non-exponential change becomes more prominent with increasing Sm 3+ and Dy 3+ content. Such decay curves are characteristic of quenching by direct transfer [24,25] . Since samples with low (Sm 3+ , Dy 3+ ) content would minimize the effects of the interactions between optically active ions, the decay curves are nearly single exponential with a long lifetime. With increasing RE ions concentration, the distance between RE ions shortens; subsequently, the energy transfer between RE ions becomes more frequent, which provides an extra decay channel to change the decay curves, resulting in a non-exponential decay curve. The possible explanation for this luminescence quenching is due to the cross-relaxation by means of direct transfer between two ions. Cross-relaxation occurs easily between two neighboring rare-earth ions. This is the process whereby excitation energy from an ion decaying from a highly excited state promotes a nearby ion from the ground state to the metastable level [26] . For Sm 3+ ion, the energy gap between the 4 G 5/2 and 6 F 9/2 levels is close to that between the 6 H 5/2 and 6 F 9/2 levels. The cross-relaxation channel in the La 1\u2212 x Sm x MoBO 6 phosphors is 4 G 5/2 + 6 H 5/2 \u2192 6 F 9/2 + 6 F 9/2 [25] . In the case of Dy 3+ ion, the energy of the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 transition matches that of the 6 H 15/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 transition. The cross-relaxation channel in the La 1\u2212 x Dy x MoBO 6 phosphors is 4 F 9/2 + 6 H 15/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 + 6 H 5/2 [25] . 4 Conclusions The luminescence properties of Sm 3+ , Dy 3+ in the compound LaMoBO 6 are reported. LaMoBO 6 :Sm 3+ exhibits orange emission corresponding to the 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 transition. The emission spectrum of LaMoBO 6 :Dy 3+ exhibits two emission bands. The yellow band (570 nm) corresponds to the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 transition, and the blue band (482 nm) corresponds to the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 transition. The optimum concentrations are 1 mol% for Sm 3+ and 4 mol% for Dy 3+ . However, the intensity of Sm 3+ and Dy 3+ emission is not strong. The quantum efficiency is only 15% for La 0.99 Sm 0.01 MoBO 6 and 10% for La 0.96 Dy 0.04 MoBO 6 . The decay curves are single exponential in the diluted samples, and the fitted lifetime is in the order of minisecond. The decay curves deviate from exponential behavior, and the non-exponential change becomes more prominent with increasing RE ions content. Cross-relaxation is responsible for the concentration quenching. Acknowledgements This work was supported by Mid-career Researcher Program through NRF grant funded by the MEST (No. 2009-0078682 ).

        "abstract": "Abstract   New potassium gadolinium phosphate [K 3 Gd 5 (PO 4 ) 6 ] doped with Eu 3+ , Ce 3+ , Tb 3+  and co-doped with Ce 3+  and Tb 3+  phosphors were prepared by high temperature solid state synthesis. Phase purity of the powders was checked by X-ray powder diffraction. Luminescence and excitation spectra of samples were reported. In particular, the interaction mechanism between Eu 3+  ions was investigated in terms of the Inokuti\u2013Hirayama model; it was found that the interactions between Eu 3+  can be assigned to dipole\u2013dipole interaction. K 3 Gd 5 (PO 4 ) 6 :Eu 3+  could act as a candidate for solid state lighting due to its strong absorption band in the near-UV region (350\u2013400\u00a0nm). The energy transfer from Ce 3+  to Tb 3+  was confirmed and the mechanism was studied using Dexteru0027s theory; it is concluded that electric dipole\u2013dipole interaction predominates in the energy transfer process from Ce 3+  to Tb 3+  in the K 3 Gd 5 (PO 4 ) 6  host. The energy transfer efficiency and critical distance were also investigated.",

The emission spectrum is so complicate that it can be deconvoluted into three fitting peaks. The emission bands peaking at 380 and 444\u00a0nm can be assigned to the 4f 6 5d 1 \u21924f 7  transition of Eu 2+  centers substituting for K +  and Ba 2+  site, while the emission band at 497\u00a0nm may be attributed to the Eu 2+  center on K +  site with a nearby charge-compensated vacancy. The decay time of the 4f 6 5d emission increases with temperature.

The synthesized samples were investigated using XRD and PL emission and excitation spectra. The emission spectra for Ce 3+  doped Ba 1.2 Ca 0.8 SiO 4  phosphors show broad bands in the 320\u2013550\u202fnm spectral region. The excitation spectra exhibit several absorption peaks in the range of 250\u2013400\u202fnm. Both the emission and excitation spectra are dependent on the excitation or monitoring wavelengths. We attribute these results to Ce 3+  ions occupying two different crystallographic sites (i.e., Ce I and Ce II). The Ce 3+ , Tb 3+  co-doped Ba 1.2 Ca 0.8 SiO 4  phosphors show Tb 3+ -related line emissions in the 475\u2013600\u202fnm spectral region and Ce 3+ -related band emissions in the 350\u2013525\u202fnm spectral region when the 4 f  \u2192 5d transition of Ce 3+  is excited (\u03bb ex \u202f=\u202f345\u202fnm), indicating that energy transfer from Ce 3+  to Tb 3+  takes place.

The optical properties of (Ba 1.29 Eu 0.01 )Ca 0.7 SiO 4  are investigated using photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra and luminescence decay time measurement between 10 and 523\u00a0K. The blue emission band peaking at \u223c448\u00a0nm is observed to be asymmetric. It can be divided into three Gaussian bands with maxima at \u223c440 (Eu I), \u223c464 (Eu II) and \u223c503\u00a0nm (Eu III), which is in good agreement with that measured from low temperature at 10\u00a0K. The temperature dependence of the PL intensity is also measured. The thermal quenching of Ba 1.3 Ca 0.7 SiO 4 :Eu 2+  is about 235\u00a0\u00b0C. The PL decay times of 425, 455 and 570\u00a0nm emission at 10\u00a0K are 0.23, 0.28 and 1.00\u00a0\u03bcs. They can be attributed to the lifetimes of Eu I, Eu II and Eu III site, respectively. The decay times of the 425 and 455\u00a0nm emission almost remain constant at 10\u00a0K and 523\u00a0K. The decay times of the emission at 570\u00a0nm do not change a lot with increasing temperature up to 300\u00a0K, then decrease to 0.2\u00a0\u03bcs\u00a0at 523\u00a0K Ba 1.3 Ca 0.7 SiO 4 :Eu 2+  is a candidate blue-emitting phosphor for white LEDs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Photoluminescence properties of CaS:Cu + , CaS:Mn 2+  and CaS:Cu + , Mn 2+  rare-earth -free phosphors prepared by a carbon-thermal reduction method were investigated. The emission spectrum of Cu + -doped CaS consists of two overlapped bands peaking at 415\u202fnm (attributed to isolated Cu +  activator) and 475\u202fnm (attributed to aggregated Cu +  center). The influence of Cu +  doping concentration on the emission spectrum is discussed. The emission spectrum of Mn 2+ -doped CaS exhibits a band emission peaking at 568\u202fnm under 250\u202fnm excitation. The emission spectra of the doubly activated CaS:Cu + , Mn 2+  phosphors consist of Cu +  and Mn 2+  emissions simultaneously, and their shapes depend strongly on the Mn 2+  concentration. Based on the emission and excitation spectra of the CaS:0.15\u202fmol%Cu + ,  x Mn 2+  phosphors, the energy transfer from Cu +  to Mn 2+  takes place. The emitting colors of the doubly activated phosphors can also be tuned. In particular, the emitting color of CaS:0.15\u202fmol% Cu + , 0.6\u202fmol % Mn 2+  sample is close to white light.",

X-ray diffraction was used to determine the crystal phase. Luminescence properties were characterized by photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra at room temperature. K 2 MgSi 3 O 8 : x Ce 3+  series emits blue light when excited by UV-light (\u03bb ex  = 350\u00a0nm). Nonequivalent substitution of K +  for Ce 3+  leads to the multiple Ce 3+  centers in the compound. K 2 MgSi 3 O 8 :Ce 3+ , Tb 3+  exhibits broad band emission of Ce 3+  and the characteristic line emission of Tb 3+ . The luminescence color could be tuned from blue (0.16, 0.10) to greenish blue (0.19, 0.26) by varying Tb 3+  content. The energy transfer has been confirmed to occur via quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. These results indicate that the K 2 MgSi 3 O 8 :Ce 3+ , Tb 3+  phosphor might be a promising material for w-LEDs application.",

Phase purity was checked using X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD). PL excitation and emission spectra were recorded to elucidate the PL properties of NaScP 2 O 7 :Eu 2+  and NaScP 2 O 7 :Eu 2+ ,Mn 2+ . Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed. PL and lifetime measurements were carried out from 10 to 525 K. Moreover, the Eu 2+  site occupation was discussed. It turned out that the incorporated Eu 2+  ions substituted for Na +  site and occupied two different sites. Temperature dependent PL measurements indicated the emission intensity decreased with increasing temperature due to temperature quenching in NaScP 2 O 7 :Eu 2+ . Fluorescence lifetimes of Eu 2+  in NaScP 2 O 7 :Eu 2+  almost did not change with a decay constant  \u03c4 =\u223c0.53 \u03bcs in the temperature range of 10\u2013280 K, and then shortened due to temperature quenching. The luminescent lifetime reached \u223c0.05 \u03bcs at  T =525 K. Finally, it was found that energy transfer occurred from Eu 2+  to Mn 2+  in co-doped NaScP 2 O 7 :Eu 2+ ,Mn 2+ .",

They both crystallize in trigonal crystal system with space group R     3  \u00af     m. Substitution of three independent Ca 2+  sites for Ce 3+  ions yields blue emission when excited by UV light (\u03bb e x  \u202f=\u202f352\u202fnm). Accordingly, Ce 3+  ions occupying two distinct Sr 2+  sites generate UV to blue light under 300-nm UV excitation. A series of Na 2 Ca 1- x  Sr  x  Si 2 O 6 :Ce 3+  ( x \u202f=\u202f0\u20131) were prepared. All the samples form solid solutions and are isotypic confirmed by Rietveld refinements. Increasing Sr 2+  content leads to asymmetrical blue shift of PL spectra. Refinement results clarify preferable site occupancy of Sr 2+  in Na 2 CaSi 2 O 6  compound which results in the irregular shift. The migration of Ce 3+  ions between M3 and M4 sites is the key point of this phenomenon. This mechanism could be a guideline to optimize the emissions of emitting centers with multiple sites.",

The excitation spectrum shows a broad band from the UV region to the blue region. The emission spectrum shows strong orange emission peaking at 610\u00a0nm, attributed to the d-f transition of the Eu2+ ion. By combining the Sr3Al2O5Cl2:Eu2+ phosphor with 420\u00a0nm and 460\u00a0nm chips, three white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were fabricated. The warm-white LEDs show color rendering indexes of 76, 66 and 90 with color temperatures of 2447, 3546 and 4300\u00a0K, respectively. This new phosphor exhibits the potential to act as a single host doped with Eu2+ phosphor for UV or blue chip excited white LEDs. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

K 2 Ba 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 2 :Eu 2+  shows a deep blue emission ( \u03bb  max \u00a0=\u00a0405\u00a0nm) when it is excited by UV lights. The broad peak at 405\u00a0nm can be decomposed to two Gaussian curves with maxima at 405 and 440\u00a0nm which can be attributed to the presence of two crystallographically different Eu 2+  sites in the crystal structure. The emission spectrum of K 2 Ba 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 2 :Ce 3+  is dependent of the excitation wavelength that also results from the two crystallographically different Ce 3+  sites. The emission spectrum of K 2 Ba 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 2 :Tb 3+  shows the  5 D 3  and  5 D 4  emission lines. The f-d spin-allowed and spin-forbidden transitions in Tb 3+  in K 2 Ba 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 2  are at about 225 and 250\u00a0nm, respectively. For the (Ce 3+ , Tb 3+ ) co-doped K 2 Ba 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 2  system, the energy transfer from Ce 3+  to Tb 3+  is observed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ce 3+ /Tb 3+  co-doped transparent glass ceramics containing YPO 4  nanocrystals were prepared using high temperature melting method, and their structural and luminous properties were investigated. XRD analysis and TEM images confirmed the existence of YPO 4  nanocrystals in glass ceramics. The transmission spectra proved that the glass ceramics specimens still maintained a high transparency. Then the excitation and emission spectra of the Ce 3+  and Tb 3+  single-doped and co-doped glass and glass ceramics were discussed, which proved that the glass ceramics had better luminescent properties. Under the near ultraviolet (331 nm) excitation, the broadband emission located at 385 nm was observed which was ascribed to 5d\u2192 2 F 5/2  and  2 F 7/2  transition of Ce 3+  ions. Several characteristic sharp peaks centered at 489, 543, 578 and 620 nm originated from the  5 D 4  to  7 F  J   ( J =6, 5, 4, 3) of Tb 3+  ions. The decay time of Tb 3+  ions at 543 nm and the relevant energy levels of Ce 3+  ions and Tb 3+  ions illustrated the transfer process from Ce 3+  ions to Tb 3+  ions. The best CIE chromaticity coordinate of the glass ceramics specimen was calculated as ( x =0.3201,  y =0.3749), which was close to the NTSC standard values for white ( x =0.333,  y =0.333). All the results suggested that the YPO 4 -based Ce 3+ /Tb 3+  co-doped glass ceramics could act as potential luminescent materials for white light-emitting diodes.",

The morphological structures of the nanocomposites are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. All of the results indicate that the microwave-assisted synthesis results in the growth of Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4} and the reduction of graphene oxide simultaneously in ethylene glycol-water system. The specific capacitance of the as-prepared Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4}@rGO nanocomposite is higher than those of rGO and pure Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4}, which indicates the synergetic interaction between rGO and Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4}. The nanocomposites also have good rate capability and cycling stability in electrochemical experiments. This facile technique may be extended to the large scale and cost effective production of other composites based on graphene and metal oxidemore\u00a0\u00bb for many applications.\u00ab\u00a0less",

        "abstract": "The prognostic significance of tumor-associated FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in invasive breast carcinomas is studied. Tregs and CTLs were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 1270 cases of invasive breast carcinoma for their associations with patient survival, histopathologic features, and molecular subtypes. Infiltrates of Tregs and CTLs were observed within tumor bed and in the tissue surrounding tumor. Within tumor bed, increased infiltration of Tregs and CTLs was significantly more common in those with unfavorable histologic features, including high histologic grade and negative ER and PR status. In addition, high density Treg infiltration was also associated with tumor HER2 overexpression, decreased overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In tissue surrounding tumor, in contrast, high CTL/Treg ratio was found to be significantly associated with improved OS and PFS. These prognostic associations were confirmed by multivariate analysis. Furthermore, the density of Treg infiltrates within tumors was inversely correlated with the prognosis of the molecular subtypes of tumors. The ratio of CTL/Treg infiltrates in the surrounding tissue was also significantly higher in luminal than non-luminal subtypes of carcinoma. The prognostic significances of Tregs and CTLs in breast carcinoma depend on their relative density and location. The density of intratumoral Treg infiltrates and the peritumoral CTL/Treg ratio are independent prognostic factors and correlated with the prognosis of the molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma, which may serve as potential target for stratifying immunotherapy to battle against the aggressive subtypes of breast carcinoma. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.",

        "abstract": "HAb18G is a recently identified hepatoma-associated antigen and its association with tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis has been studied in a variety of tumors. However, its role in the tumor progression of breast cancer has not been explored. HAb18G expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in pathological sections of 1,637 breast tissue samples and by in situ hybridization in 41 cases of invasive breast carcinomas (BC). While not detected in any cases of tumor-like conditions or benign tumors of breast, and only rarely in normal tissue (4.4%), HAb18G expression was gradually up-regulated from atypical ductal hyperplasia (27.3%), to ductal carcinoma-in situ (59.8%), and to BC (61.4%) (P < 0.01). Its expression in BC was correlated positively with C-erbB-2 expression and histologic grade (P < 0.001), and negatively with the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors (P < 0.001). Significant differences of expression were also identified among the subgroups of BC examined: in decreasing order from invasive micropapillary carcinoma, ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, to mucinous adenocarcinoma (P = 0.001), corresponding to their known clinical aggressiveness. In an expanded group of 186 BC patients with proper follow up, our previous findings were confirmed: HAb18G expression was significantly associated with local recurrence, distant metastasis and tumor mortality (P < 0.01). We also demonstrated that up-regulated tumor expression of HAb18G was a significant predictor of reduced disease progression-free survival rate and a shorter overall survival, independent of systemic therapies. In conclusion, this study suggests that HAb18G expression is associated with BC progression and prognosis. Further evaluation of this new marker in breast cancer is indicated.",

        "abstract": "Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP), an adapter protein containing PDZ domains, contributes to the tumorigenicity and metastasis of many malignant tumors, such as malignant melanoma. Our study aimed in revealing the expression profile of SDCBP in breast cancer (BCa) and its role in tumor cell proliferation, and then exploring its value in the targeted treatment of BCa.We first evaluated the SDCBP expression by immunohistochemistry in normal breast and BCa tissues. Then we explored the expression profile of SDCBP in different BCa cell lines. By constructing SDCBP-silenced BCa cell clones, we further assessed the effects of SDCBP suppression on tumor cells in vitro by cell culture and in vivo by tumorigenicity. SDCBP expression was detected in 80.6% (n\u200a=\u200a160) of BCa tissues, in contrast to its expression in 13% (n\u200a=\u200a23) of normal breast tissues (P<0.001). Among the tumors, the level of its expression was positively correlated with histological grade and tumor staging while negatively correlated with the estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Higher expression of SDCBP was also noted in ER-negative BCa cell lines. It was also identified that SDCBP expression was down-regulated in a dose-dependent mode by 17-\u03b2 estradiol in estrogen-responsive MCF-7. Furthermore, SDCBP silence inhibited ER-negative tumor cell growth in vivo and in vitro. Cell cycle studies showed that SDCBP silence increased G1 cell population and resulted in related cell-cycle-regulator changes: up-regulation of p21 and p27 while down-regulation of cyclin E.Our results suggested that SDCBP played an important role in tumor growth of ER-negative BCas. In these tumors where the estrogen signaling pathway is not available, SDCBP probably contribute to tumor growth through an alternative signaling pathway by promoting tumor cells passing the G1/S checkpoint into the cell cycle. Suppression of SDCBP expression may have its potential to become a targeted therapy for ER-negative BCas.",

The aim was to examine their roles in the metastasis of invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast, a tumour with a high propensity for nodal spread.We compared the expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in 103 cases of breast cancer containing IMPC components with a control group of 96 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), not otherwise specified type by immunohistochemistry and chemical in situ hybridization (CISH). The results showed that the predominant cytoplasmic expression of both SDF-1 and CXCR4 was greater in tumour cells of the IMPC components than in those of the non-IMPC components and the control IDC cases, and was correlated significantly with the number of positive lymph nodes (P < 0.05). SDF-1 expression on cell membranes was less frequently identified in IMPC than IDC (P = 0.021). Immunohistochemical detection of SDF-1 in endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels was more common in IMPC (P = 0.007) and correlated significantly with lymph node status (P = 0.002), although SDF-1 mRNA was rarely detected by CISH.This study suggests that up-regulation of cytoplasmic expression of SDF-1/CXCR4 might be one of the molecular mechanisms facilitating lymph node metastasis of IMPC.",

        "abstract": "Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have been correlated with a better prognosis for some tumors and medullary carcinoma of breast is a good example. However, in a recent study of invasive micropapillary carcinoma of breast, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with increased lymph node metastasis and a poorer prognosis. To explore possible mechanisms underlying this difference in immune responsiveness and tumor behavior, 28 cases of invasive micropapillary carcinoma with prominent lymphocyte infiltration were compared with 29 cases of medullary carcinoma. In both tumors, the majority of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were T lymphocytes (P<0.01) with CD8+ T lymphocytes predominant (P<0.01). Significantly, functional differences in CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes were identified in the two types of tumor. While lymphocytes infiltrated both the stroma and epithelial components of medullary carcinoma, the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes of invasive micropapillary carcinoma were almost exclusively confined to the stroma. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes of medullary carcinoma showed stronger expression of FasL than those in invasive micropapillary carcinoma (P<0.01) and medullary carcinoma cells exhibited stronger expression of Fas than invasive micropapillary carcinoma cells did (P<0.01). In the subgroups of tumors with strong (++/+++) Fas expression, double immunohistochemistry revealed that most of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in medullary carcinoma, particularly those infiltrating the tumor nests, were CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, but not so in invasive micropapillary carcinoma. Furthermore, upregulated expression of perforin, granzyme B and FasL by cytotoxic T lymphocytes was greater in medullary carcinoma than invasive micropapillary carcinoma (P<0.01, respectively). The results suggest that effective immunity provided by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes varies in different tumors and the relative lack of tumor-killing cytotoxic T lymphocytes in invasive micropapillary carcinoma may explain, in part, the adverse association of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with the biological behavior of invasive micropapillary carcinoma of breast.",

It is unclear whether their presence correlates with clinicopathological features of invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast, an unusual subtype of breast cancer with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. CD44 and CD24 expression was determined by double-staining immunohistochemistry in 103 cases of IMPC and in 94 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The prevalence of CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) tumor cells was higher in IMPC than in invasive ductal carcinoma IDC (P=0.018). The CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) tumor cells were also detected in adjacent stroma surrounding the micropapillary structure in 53.4% (55/103) of IMPC, but only in 7.4% (7/94) of stroma of IDC. These tumor cells in stroma of IMPC were positive for vimentin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and negative for E-cadherin. The CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) tumor cells in the micropapillary structure of IMPC were associated with those in stroma (P=0.000). Moreover, they were both associated with lymphovascular invasion and extranodal extension, respectively (P<0.05). The proportion of CD24(+) tumor cells was also higher in IMPC than in IDC (P=0.035), and the CD24(+) tumor cells were associated with lymph node metastasis in IMPC (P=0.010). The results suggest that the increased proportion of CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) tumor cells and CD24(+) tumor cells and the epithelial mesenchymal transition may play an important role in aggressiveness and high metastatic risk of breast IMPC.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer surgical options now include nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM), but there has been much controversy regarding the oncologic safety of the preserved nipple. This study evaluates frequency and patterns of occult nipple involvement in a large contemporary cohort of patients, aiming to improve patient selection for NSM. A total of 2323 consecutive mastectomy specimens with grossly unremarkable nipples were evaluated by sagittal sections through the entire nipple and subareolar tissue. Sixteen different clinical and tumor parameters were examined to predict cancerous nipple involvement. Nipple involvement was noted in 331 of 2323 (14.2%) mastectomy specimens. Occult nipple involvement rate was 10.7% (248 cases). Occult nipple involvement usually occurs as ductal carcinoma in situ. In univariate analysis, patient age, tumor size, tumor-to-nipple distance, tumor central location, tumor type, lymph node status, lymphatic vascular invasion, histologic grade, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) amplification, and multicentric or multifocal tumor were associated with positive nipple involvement. By multivariate logistic regression analysis with the entire selection process, tumor size, tumor-to-nipple distance, central location, lymph node status, lymphatic vascular invasion, HER-2 amplification, and multicentric or multifocal tumor were shown to be associated with nipple involvement by carcinoma. Nearly 90% women undergoing mastectomy did not have occult nipple involvement. NSM may be a viable option in appropriate patient selection and setting. NAC preservation would be appropriate in HER-2 negative, axillary lymph node, and lymphatic vascular negative patients with small, solitary tumors located on the periphery of the breast.",

        "abstract": "It has been reported that dense intratumoral infiltration of Foxp3 (+)Tregs (Tregs) was an independent factor for poor prognosis of breast cancer (BC) patients. However, the cytokines activating the Treg infiltration are not known. This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of CCL22 and TGF-\u03b21 in this cascade and their prognostic significance for BC patients. 417 cases of invasive breast cancer were selected from the prior study cohort and the expressions of CCL22 and TGF-\u03b21 were assessed by immunohistochemistry. It was identified that tumor secretion of CCL22 was positively correlated with the intratumoral Treg infiltration (P<0.0001), but its association with lymphoid aggregates surrounding the tumor was not proven to be significant (P=0.056). Moreover, CCL22 expression was found to be associated with the tumor histological features known to be related with unfavorable prognosis of patients, including high histological grade (P<0.0001), negative ER (P<0.0001), negative PR (P=0.001), and HER2 amplification (P=0.028). Similar to intratumoral Treg infiltrates, CCL22 tumor secretion correlated with the prognosis of the molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma (P<0.0001). Univariate analysis revealed CCL22 to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS, P<0.0001) and progression-free survival (PFS, P<0.0001) of BC patients that were confirmed by multivariate analysis (P=0.011 and P=0.010 respectively). In contrast, although TGF-\u03b21 expression was positively correlated with both Tregs infiltrates into the tumor bed and lymphoid aggregates surrounding the tumor (P=0.023; P=0.046, respectively), its expression was not significantly associated with the molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma and the prognosis of the patients. Our study indicates that both CCL22 and TGF-\u03b21 are candidate chemoattractants for intratumoral Foxp3 (+)Tregs infiltration; however, unlike the later, CCL22 is an independent prognostic predictor of BC patients, and it therefore may have the potential to serve as a target for immunotherapeutic strategy of BC.",

We here assessed the changes of Tregs before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) and their relationships with tumor response and patient survival. Intratumoral and peritumoral infiltration of FOXP3(+) Tregs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 132 cases of invasive breast carcinomas before and after NC. After NC, the density of infiltrated Tregs within tumor bed remained stable, whereas it decreased significantly (P = 0.015) in the tissue surrounding tumor. The changes were significant in those tumors that usually response to NC, including the HER2-enriched and basal-like subtypes (P = 0.035; P = 0.004). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the decreased peritumoral Tregs were an independent predictor for pathologic complete response (pCR), while the intratumoral Tregs after chemotherapy was proved to be associated with overall survival and progression-free survival of the patients. The findings of the study indicated that peritumoral Treg was sensitive to chemotherapy and associated with pCR, while intratumoral Treg was an independent prognostic predictor of breast cancer patients.",

To investigate the relationship between pathologic features and lymph node metastasis, 51 cases of breast carcinoma with IMPC components were studied. Immunohistochemical analysis for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-3 was performed, and lymphatic vessel density was measured. The main findings included a significantly increased number of positive lymph nodes and/or an increased rate of lymph node metastasis in IMPC with a higher histologic grade, prominent stromal infiltration of lymphocytes, and higher VEGF-C expression and lymphatic vessel density. The percentage of IMPC component in the tumor was not associated with the incidence of lymph node metastasis. The results suggest that the histologic grade, lymphatic vessel density, and lymphocyte infiltration of IMPC are the key factors that influence lymph node metastasis.

        "abstract": "In 2009, ASCO/CAP expanded its human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) testing guideline to define HER2 genetic heterogeneity (GH). However, the clinical significance of GH is unclear. We investigated the impact of HER2 GH on HER2 testing and studied its clinicopathologic significance. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissues of surgical resections of 617 non-consecutive breast carcinoma patients were studied by routine HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). HER2 GH was evaluated, and the results were correlated with HER2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry and HER2 gene amplification by FISH, and with various clinicopathologic parameters. HER2 GH was observed in 15.2 % (94/617) of the patients. It was associated with low-to-middle level of HER2 expression, and with none-to-low level of HER2 gene amplification. Among the 17 patients with equivocal HER2 FISH results, 35.3 % (6/17) of tumors displayed GH. In contrast with HER2-positive tumors without GH, tumors with HER2 GH demonstrated significant association with lower histologic grade, smaller tumor size, and proclivity to hormone receptor expression. HER2 GH is a substantial cause of equivocal HER2 testing results of breast cancer by FISH. Tumors with HER2 GH showed that biologic features resemble more of HER2-negative tumors than HER2-positive tumors without GH. The findings indicate a need of the guidelines to clarify whether tumors with HER2 GH truly benefit from HER2-targeted therapy of breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast is a histologic subtype of breast cancer and associated with high incidence of lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impact of precise pathologic diagnosis and individualized treatment on the outcomes of invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast. The study group included 2299 women with invasive micropapillary carcinoma diagnosed at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between January 2004 and December 2015. In the study group, specimens were examined with the method of whole-specimen orientation and serial sectioning, and patients received precise pathological diagnosis and individualized treatment. The control group of invasive micropapillary carcinoma consisted of 163 cases, identified through a retrospectively review of 9056 invasive carcinomas diagnosed at our institution between January 1989 and December 2003 using the standard pathology-evaluation method (i.e., not using the whole-specimen orientation and serial-sectioning method). The clinicopathological features, treatments and outcomes were compared between the two groups. The incidence of invasive micropapillary carcinoma in the study group was 6% (2299/39,714 cases), significantly higher than that of the control group (2%; 163/9056 cases). The 5-year disease-free survival in the study group was significantly higher than that in the control group (83.8 vs.45.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.05). The 5-year overall survival was significantly increased from 57.4% in the control group to 90.9% in the study group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In the multivariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion, estrogen receptor status and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors. Although invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast is associated with poor prognosis, precise pathologic diagnosis and individualized treatment improved the disease-free survival and overall survival of invasive micropapillary carcinoma patients. Precise pathological diagnosis is the premises for individualized treatments and for improving the outcomes of patients with invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast.",

        "abstract": "Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) is a rare variant of ductal carcinoma of the breast, and is characterized by a high metastatic potential and an aggressive clinical course. Studies of CD146 expression and function in breast cancer remain scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CD146 and microvessel density (MVD) in breast IMPC. CD146 mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry for CD146 and MVD measured by CD31 were assessed in 82 cases of IMPC and 137 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS). The mRNA level of CD146 in cancer specimens was higher in IMPC than in IDC-NOS. CD146 expression in tumor cells was up-regulated in IMPC as compared with that in IDC-NOS, and was positively correlated with histological grade, ER, PR status, and P53 expression in IMPC and IDC-NOS. CD146 expression in vascular endothelial cells was significantly higher than that in IDC, and was positively correlated with tumor progression in IMPC and IDC-NOS. MVD in IMPC was significantly higher than that in IDC. CD146 expression in tumor cells was positively correlated with that in vascular endothelial cells of IMPC and IDC-NOS. The association of CD146 expression with MVD and its correlation with progression in breast carcinoma indicated that CD146 is a potentially useful prognostic marker for breast cancer. CD146 could be a new drug target in the treatment of breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Within the past several years, inhibition of the PARP1 activity has been emerged as one of the most excit- ing and promising strategies for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) therapy. The purpose of this study is to assess PARP1 expression in TNBCs and to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in PARP1 promoter or 3u0027 un- translated region (3u0027UTR) and PARP1 expression. It was found that PARP1 was overexpressed in nuclear (nPARP1), cytoplasm (cPARP1) and nuclear-cytoplasmic coexisting (coPARP1) of 187 TNBCs in comparison to that of 115 non-TNBCs (nPARP1, pu003c0.001; cPARP1, pu003c0.001; coPARP1, pu003c0.001). High expression of nPARP1 and cPARP1 in breast cancer was related to worse progression-free survival (nPARP1, p=0.007, cPARP1, p=0.003). Additionally, we identified seven published polymorphism sites in the promoter region and in 3u0027UTR of PARP1 by sequencing. rs7527192 and rs2077197 genotypes were found to be significantly associated with the cPARP1 expression in TNBC patients (rs7527192 AA+GA versus GG, p=0.014; rs2077197 AA+GA versus GG, p=0.041). These findings were confirmed in an independent validation set of 88 TNBCs (rs7527192 GG versus GA+AA, p=0.030; rs2077197 GG versus GA+AA, p=0.030). The PARP1 over-expression including nuclear, cytoplasm and nuclear-cytoplasmic co- existing is a feature of TNBCs and the assessment of its expression may help to predict the efficacy of chemotherapy with PARP1 inhibitor.",

Although recognizing micropapillary architecture is often not challenging, the criteria for distinguishing between mixed and pure IMPC remain imprecise. Some mucin-producing carcinomas can also have micropapillary histology, but there is no consensus on whether these tumors are variants of IMPC or mucinous carcinomas. The molecular genetic studies demonstrate that IMPCs have distinct molecular genetic profiles, supporting the theory that they constitute distinct pathologic entities.

The aim of this study was to investigate the extent and patterns of TAMs in BLBC and their associations with clinicopathological features and patient survival.  We evaluated TAMs in 200 cases of BLBC by immunohistochemistry using the M2 macrophage marker CD163 and the pan-macrophage marker CD68 in tumor nest and stroma, and assessed their prognostic significance. The study demonstrated that infiltration of CD163 and CD68 macrophages in tumor stroma was of clinical relevance in BLBC, but not those in tumor nest. Increased stromal infiltration of CD68 or CD163 macrophages correlated with larger tumor size, higher histological grade, higher 5-year recurrence and 5-year breast cancer mortality. Although both of CD68 and CD163 macrophages in tumor stroma were associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), multivariate analysis demonstrated that only CD163 macrophage was an independent predictor of RFS and OS.  Our results highlight the prognostic importance of TAMs' location in BLBC. CD163, a highly specific biomarker for M2 macrophages, is an independent prognostic marker for BLBC patients, and may serve as an indicator or potential target of macrophage-centred therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast is a highly aggressive breast cancer. Polarity reversal exemplified by cluster growth is hypothesized to contribute to the invasiveness and metastasis of IMPC. In this study, we demonstrate that levels of \u03b21 integrin and Rac1 expression were greater in breast IMPC than in invasive breast carcinoma of no specific type and paraneoplastic benign breast tissue. We show that silencing \u03b21 integrin expression using the \u03b21 integrin inhibitor AIIB2 partially restored polarity in IMPC primary cell clusters and downregulated Rac1. Thus, overexpression of \u03b21 integrin upregulates Rac1. Univariate analysis showed that overexpression of \u03b21 integrin and Rac1 was associated with breast cancer cell polarity reversal, lymph node metastasis, and poor disease-free survival in IMPC patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that polarity reversal was an independent predictor of poor disease-free survival. These findings indicate that overexpression of \u03b21 integrin and the resultant upregulation of Rac1 contribute to polarity reversal and metastasis of breast IMPC, and that \u03b21 integrin and Rac1 could be potential prognostic biomarkers and targets for treatment of breast IMPC.",

        "abstract": "Effects of soil moisture under different treatments on the changes of soil temperature were analyzed according to the field experiment of plastic film mulched and non-mulched spring wheat. The results show that the difference of soil temperature among different soil moisture treatments is remarkable. Soil temperature under severe water deficit treatment is higher than that under other water deficit treatments in the whole growth stage of spring wheat, and the daily maximum temperature is 9.8\u2103 higher than that under the well-watering treatments on non-mulched field. And the daily maximum soil temperature under the well-watering treatment, the light water deficit treatment and the medium water deficit treatment on plastic film mulched wheat is 6.4\u2103, 4.6\u2103 and 1.7\u2103 higher than that under the well-watering treatments, respectively. Influenced by the different factors, there is a remarkable difference of soil temperature during the trefoil stage and filling stage, which the range of daily soil temperature varies from 2.1\u2103 to 11.4\u2103, and from 2.4\u2103 to 13.5\u2103, respectively. The variation of daily soil temperature decreases from the top (34.6-40.9\u2103) to 25cm depth (3.0 -3.5\u2103). There is no significant difference under the light water deficit and the medium water deficit treatment on plastic film mulched wheat at the depth of 0-5cm from the top. There is extremly significant difference among other treatments. The research results provids a theory basis for regulating soil temperature of plastic film mulched spring wheat and establishing irrigation schedule.",

Rats' hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal, lymphocytes, bone, liver, and kidney, and spleen were taken for determining whole-genome mRNA expression with gene chip, and a quantitative nerve network model was established by utilizing the gene expression profile of different aged rats, then the model was used to evaluate the effects of EF on Shen-deficiency syndrome.Totally 199 genes showing age-dependent characteristics were screened out from the 7 kinds of tissue, most of them were neuro-endocrine immune related genes. Evaluation based on the mathematical model showed the age of hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal, liver, kidney, bone, and spleen in the 24-months rats after EF intervention was 12.64, 10.87, 8.10, 12.70, 11.93, 13.14, and 10.13 months, respectively.A quantitative mathematical model can be established based on the gene expression profile, it is suitable for estimating the efficacy of Shen-tonifying drugs.

        "abstract": "To investigate the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of icariin (ICA) on self-renewal and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs).NSCs were derived from forebrains of mice embryos by mechanical dissociation into single cell suspension. The self-renewal of NSCs was measured by neurosphere formation assay. The proliferation of NSCs was detected by water-soluble tetrazolium (WST) and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay. Protein expression of neuron-specific marker tubulin-\u03b2III(TuJ1) and astrocyte-specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Using microarray, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened between NSCs with or without ICA treatment. The signaling pathways enriched by these DEGs and their role in mediating effects of ICA were analyzed.ICA significantly promoted neurosphere formation of NSCs cultured in growth protocol in a dose-dependent manner and achieved the maximum effects at 100 nmol/L. ICA also increased optical absorbance value and EdU incorporation into nuclei of NSCs. ICA had no significant effects on the percentage of TuJ1 or GFAP-positive cells, and TuJ1 or GFAP protein expression in NSCs cultured in differentiation protocol. A total of 478 genes were found to be differentially regulated. Among signaling pathways significantly enriched by DEGs, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was of interest. Blockade of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/MAPK, other than p38/MAPK subfamily pathway partially abolished effects of ICA on neurosphere formation and EdU incorporation of NSCs.ICA can promote the selfrenewal of NSCs at least partially through ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.",

However, little is known about the role of endogenous glucocorticoids in airway allergic disease. Objective: To investigate the effects of endogenous glucocorticoids on regulating allergic inflammation and TH1/TH2 balance in an airway allergic murine model. Methods: An ovalbumin-sensitized murine model was established by intraperitoneal injection sensitization and intranasal challenge with ovalbumin. Glucocorticoid release was inhibited by administration of metyrapone, and the peripheral glucocorticoid receptors were blocked by administration of RU486. The numbers of eosinophils in the lung, peripheral blood, and bone marrow were quantified. The changes in TH2/TH1 cells were investigated by flow cytometry, and their cytokines were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, including interleukin 4, interleukin 5, and interferon \u03b3, in the supernatant of the spleen cell culture. Results: Inhibition of endogenous glucocorticoids caused more sneezing and further increased eosinophil counts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of the sensitized mice. However, by inhibition of endogenous glucocorticoids, the interferon \u03b3 levels were upregulated, the interleukin 4 and 5 levels were down-regulated, and the ratio of TH2/TH1 cells decreased significantly, indicating a shift to a TH1-predominant immune response in sensitized mice. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids play an important role in abating allergic inflammatory reaction and modulating the TH1/TH2 balance in an airway allergic murine model. Inhibition of endogenous glucocorticoids resulted in a shift to TH1 predominance, but that did not attenuate the severity of the allergic inflammatory reaction.",

        "abstract": "To study the immunoregulatory effect of an optimal Chinese herbal monomer compound, which consists of three monomers, namely, icariin, baicalin and Astragalus saponin I, in a mouse model of allergic rhinitis.A mouse model of allergic rhinitis was established by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin and aluminum hydroxide gel suspension. The splenic lymphocytes of the mice were separated, cultured in 96-well plates and divided into three groups: control group, concanavalin A group and compound group. Splenic lymphocyte proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8 method at different time points. Cell cycle distribution was observed by flow cytometry (FCM) also at different time points. The changes of intracellular calcium concentration of splenic lymphocytes were measured by fluorescence microplate reader after the cells were incubated with fluorescence probe Fluo-3/AM.The Chinese herbal monomer compound could inhibit cell proliferation induced by concanavalin A (P<0.01). And the inhibition presented a time-effect relationship. With extending of the action time, the inhibition rate gradually increased and reached peak at the 48th hour. FCM test revealed the fact that concanavalin A could promote cells to enter into the mitosis by reducing the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phases while increasing the percentage of cells in S and G(2)/M phases. Compared with the concanavalin A, the compound could increase the percentage of cells in G(0)/G(1) phases and at the same time reduce the percentage of cells in S and G(2)/M phases at different time points, with the effect most significant at the 24th hour (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The results of the test taken by the fluorescence microplate reader revealed that the fluorescence value of the concanavalin A group increased with time in the previous 24 h while the compound could reduce this trend obviously, thus reduce the intracellular calcium concentration (P<0.01).The Chinese herbal monomer compound can inhibit the proliferation of cultured splenic lymphocytes of mice with allergic rhinitis. The effects of the compound of lowering intracellular calcium concentration and arresting cell cycle at G(0)/G(1) phases from entering into S and G(2)/M phases are responsible for its antiproliferation activity.",

The effect of CBR on the average live time (at 25 degrees C), movement distance in 20 seconds, the frequency of pharyngeal pump in 30 seconds, and the reproductive capability were assessed.Compared with the control group, the survival time of heat stressed C. elegans could be significantly increased in each CBR group (P < 0.01). The survival time of heat stressed C. elegans could be elongated, the protein toxicity be attenuated, and the live time prolonged in the high and middle dose CBR groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05).The movement distance and the frequency of pharyngeal pump could also be increased in the high dose CBR group (P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the reproductive capability among all groups (P > 0.05).CBR could significantly enhance the stress capacity of C. elegans against internal and external environment, and prolong their lifespan. It did not interfere their normal production, and also could improve the quality of life, thus laying a foundation for further mechanism studies and pharmacological researches on CBR in preventing and treating CFS.",

        "abstract": "A well designed and implemented working capital management is expected to contribute positively to the creation of a firm's value.The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence about the effects of working capital management on firm's performance.We first give literature review and develop four Hypotheses.The dependent variable,return on core asset is used as a measure of profitability,and the key variables used as measures of working capital management efficiency in the analysis are inventories days,accounts receivables days,accounts payable days and cash conversion cycle.We assume inventories days,accounts receivables days and cash conversion cycle are negatively related to corporate profitability,while accounts payable days are positively related to corporate profitability.Then the relationship between working capital management and corporate profitability is investigated for a sample of 519 Chinese Listed Manufacturing Companies,using panel data analysis for the period of 2004-2006.The regression results show that there is a statistical significance between profitability and working capital management efficiency measured by cash conversion cycle and each different component.High investment in receivables and inventories is associated with lower profitability,and short cash conversion cycle is associated with higher profitability.However,there is a negative relation between accounts payable and corporate profitability,which is not consistent with our hypothesis.A possible explanation for that is in the special environment of emerging economy in China,less profitable firms may wait longer to pay their bills.The results suggest that managers can increase corporate profitability by setting up proper trade credit policy and inventory policy to handle correctly the cash conversion cycle and keep accounts receivables,accounts payables and inventory to an optimum level.Although the conclusion is drawn from analyzing data of listed manufacturing companies,it is meaningful for listed companies in other industries and small enterprises as well.",

The result shows that the enterprises with relative stronger market power are able to obtain both more trade credit and bank borrowing than the enterprises with relative weaker market power. Further analysis shows that, the substitution relationship between trade credit and bank borrowing is more significant in the enterprises with relative stronger market power and the relationship is relatively low or even don't exist in the enterprises with relative weaker market power. This finding implies the financing difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises and provides micro-level empirical support for the development of Grass-roots finance and the improvement of small and medium-sized enterprise financing environment.",

We report the first case of PCNSTCL with aberrant expression of CD20 and CD79a in an 81-year-old man with a left periventricular brain mass. A biopsy revealed dense lymphoid infiltrate consisting of medium-sized cells in a background of gliosis and many histiocytes. The lymphoid cells were positive for CD2, CD3, CD7, CD8, T-cell intracellular antigen-1, granzyme B, CD20, and CD79a and negative for CD4, CD5, PAX-5, OCT-2, BOB-1, human herpes virus-8, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs. Molecular studies revealed clonal TCR-\u03b2 and TCR-\u03b3 gene rearrangements and negative immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. The patient was treated with chemotherapy (vincristine and methotrexate) and rituximab, but he died 1 month after the diagnosis. This is a unique case that emphasizes the use of a multimodal approach, including a broad immunohistochemical panel and molecular studies in lineage determination for lymphomas with ambiguous phenotype.",

Each case had an FNAB, and 191 cases also underwent a CNB. The subclassification rate according to the WHO (2008) was 67% overall, 81% for the FNAB with CNB group, and 40% for the FNAB group. In the FNAB with CNB group, the subclassification rates for cases with and without a history of lymphoma were not significantly different. A definitive diagnosis of lymphoma relied on ancillary studies, but was not affected by location, or the needle gauge of CNB. Follow-up data revealed a high diagnostic accuracy of FNAB with CNB. In conclusion, the use of FNAB and CNB with ancillary studies is effective in providing a definitive diagnosis of lymphoma in our experience at the Northwell Health System.",

CD8 expression in this setting is extremely rare. We identified 5 cases of CHL with aberrant CD8 expression from our database. The patients included 3 men and 2 women with a median age of 33 years (range = 20-59 years). All the patients initially presented with lymphadenopathy and variable number of RS cells. Two cases were classified as mixed cellularity type that showed prominent vascular proliferation mimicking peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Two cases represented nodular sclerosis type. The tumor cells in all cases were positive for CD8 and negative for CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD7 and carried germline T-cell receptor genes. Molecular studies revealed T-cell receptor genes to be in germline configuration in 4 cases with available information. Given the morphologic overlap with peripheral T-cell lymphoma and the rarity of this type of CHL, identifying more cases will help our better understanding of this entity.",

Clinical presentation is highly variable and may include B symptoms, neurological deficits, and/or cutaneous findings. The diagnosis of IVLBCL is difficult due to multiorgan involvement and nonspecific symptoms. We describe the case of a 68-year-old male who presented with progressive weakness, confusion, and falls. He had a past medical history of liver cirrhosis secondary to Wilson's disease. Physical exam and laboratory results revealed a lethargic man with jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and abnormal liver/kidney function tests. He expired after a short hospital course in the setting of hepatic and renal failure. Postmortem examination revealed large neoplastic lymphoid cells involving multiple organ blood vessels; however skin and neurologic involvement was absent. The neoplastic cells demonstrated B-cells positive for CD5, rendering a diagnosis of IVLBCL. Our case represents the occurrence of IVLBCL with CD5-positivity in a patient with Wilson's disease, diagnosed at autopsy demonstrating the challenging nature of diagnosing IVLBCL.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In steel industry, it is crucial to predict hot metal temperature (HMT), which is strongly related to the product quality and the thermal state, to keep high productivity of the blast furnace. The present work proposes a novel ensemble pattern trees model to predict HMT. Ensemble pattern trees is a robust nonlinear modeling method, which aggregates a set of pattern trees models into a single predictive model via the bagging technique. Ensemble pattern trees overcomes the drawback of single pattern trees which may not be robust enough against the random variations such as process perturbations and noises in the blast furnace. In addition, a novel variable importance measure derived from the ensemble pattern trees is proposed to understand which process variables affect the final hot metal quality. The proposed method was validated through an industrial blast furnace ironmaking process, and the results have demonstrated its superiority to several conventional methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Virtual sensing technology is crucial for monitoring product quality when real-time measurement is not available. To deal with both strong nonlinearity and time-varying dynamics of industrial processes, we propose a novel locally weighted kernel PLS (LW-KPLS) based on sparse nonlinear features in this research. Unlike the conventional locally weighted PLS (LW-PLS), the proposed method weights the training samples by using sparse kernel feature characterization factors (SKFCFs), which take account of the strength of nonlinear dependency between samples in the Hilbert feature space. By integrating the nonlinear features into the locally weighted regression framework, LW-KPLS not only can cope with the time-varying characteristics but also is more suitable for highly nonlinear processes. The proposed method was validated through a numerical example, a penicillin fermentation process, and a real industrial cleaning process for residual drug substances. The results have demonstrated that the proposed LW-KPLS outperforms the conventional PLS, KPLS, LW-PLS, and eLW-KPLS in the prediction performance.",

        "abstract": "A blast furnace is a huge counter-current reactor, which is used for reducing iron ores to hot metal in the ironmaking industry. Its operation is difficult due to the internal harsh operating environment and the complex chemical-physical reactions. In the blast furnace, hot metal temperature (HMT) is an important product quality and also an important thermal state indicator, therefore HMT needs to be controlled at a desired level so that stable and efficient operation is achieved. To realize this goal, a pattern trees-based virtual sensing technology is proposed in this study. Pattern trees regression is a nonlinear modeling technology, which constructs a hierarchical and tree-structured functional relationship between the process variables and HMT in an interpretable way. Pattern trees uses triangular norms, triangular conorms, and arithmetic operators while the conventional decision trees uses only triangular norms operators. Thus, pattern trees is more flexible and efficient for data-mining and constructing the prediction models. We applied pattern trees to build a soft-sensor, or virtual sensor, of HMT by using real operation data of a blust furnace. The results have shown that pattern trees outperforms the conventional methods such as PLS, decision trees, and random forest both for the current time prediction and for multi-step-ahead prediction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In semiconductor industry, the etching process is a highly sophisticated nonlinear process, which significantly affects the wafer quality. Fault detection technique has been investigated as a promising tool to reduce the fault wafers and increase overall equipment effectiveness. However, traditional fault detection models are not adequate enough to describe the etching process due to the high complexity and non-linearity of wafer processing process. In this study, a novel fault detection technique called multiway principal polynomial analysis (MPPA) is proposed. MPPA is a nonlinear modeling technique which learns a low-dimensional representation from process data based on a sequence of principal polynomials. Compared to linear methods, MPPA is more flexible and efficient in tackling process nonlinearity. Furthermore, MPPA has the desirable properties of invertibility, volume-preservation, and straightforward out-of-sample extension, thus making it interpretable and easier to implement in real application. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed MPPA, it was applied to a nonlinear numerical example and the real-world operation data of a semiconductor manufacturing process. The application results demonstrated that the proposed MPPA method outperforms the conventional MPCA, FD-kNN, and PC-kNN in the fault detection performance.",

If estimates of the soft-sensor are blindly believed and used in a control system, the product quality and process performance will be deteriorated. To solve this issue, an on-line reliability evaluation method of soft-sensors using the k-nearest-neighbor rule (RE-kNN) was developed in this study. RE-kNN makes full use of the kNN rule to obtain local information, therefore it is suitable for nonlinear and multimodal cases. Since RE-kNN is a model-free approach, it can be applied to reliability evaluation of any inferential model. In addition, simple y-analyzer fault identification rules were also proposed by integrating RE-kNN with the 3-sigma method. The validity of the proposed methods was verified through numerical examples and a new, rigorous vinyl acetate monomer plant model. The application results demonstrate that the proposed methods are efficient to evaluate the reliability of soft-sensors and to detect y-analyzer faults.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The modern steel industry aims to produce high-quality products with higher product yield, lower costs, and lower energy consumption to meet market demands. To accomplish these goals, it is necessary to reduce or eliminate product defects. However, the relationship of operating conditions to the defect formation is not fully understood. There is increasing interest in developing models to monitor the quality and predict the number of defects in real time. Modeling and analyzing the defect count data is a very challenging problem because the defect count data exhibit the unique characteristics of non-negative integers, overdispersion, high skewed distribution, and excess zeros. To explicitly account for these unique characteristics, the present work develops an on-line quality monitoring and prediction system based on the hurdle regression model. The basic idea of the hurdle model is that a binomial model governs the binary outcome of the dependent variable being zero or positive. If the dependent variable takes a positive value, \u201dhurdle is crossed\u201d, and the conditional distribution of the positives can be modeled by a zero-truncated Poisson or negative binomial (NB) model. Compared to Poisson and NB models, the hurdle model is not only suitable for modeling discrete and non-negative integer data, but also sufficient for handling both overdispersion and excess zeros data. The effectiveness of the hurdle model was verified through its application to the real defect data of a steelmaking plant. The results have demonstrated that the hurdle NB model is superior to the Poisson, NB, hurdle Poisson, and PLS models in the prediction performance.",

QR-ICR extracts independent components (ICs) using a quality-relevant independent component analysis (QR-ICA) algorithm, which simultaneously maximizes the non-Gaussianity of ICs and statistical dependency between ICs and quality variables. Meanwhile, two new types of statistical criteria, called cumulative percent relevance (CPR) and Max-Dependency (Max-Dep), are proposed to rank the order and determine the number of ICs according to their contributions to quality variables.

        "title": "Quantifying Surface Urban Heat Island Formation in the World Heritage Tropical Mountain City of Sri Lanka.",
        "abstract": "Presently, the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, and its adverse impacts, are becoming major research foci in various interrelated fields due to rapid changes in urban ecological environments. Various cities have been investigated in previous studies, and most of the findings have facilitated the introduction of proper mitigation measures to overcome the negative impact of UHI. At present, most of the mountain cities of the world have undergone rapid urban development, and this has resulted in the increasing surface UHI (SUHI) phenomenon. Hence, this study focuses on quantifying SUHI in Kandy City, the world heritage tropical mountain city of Sri Lanka, using Landsat data (1996 and 2017) based on the mean land surface temperature (LST), the difference between the fraction of impervious surfaces (IS), and the fraction of green space (GS). Additionally, we examined the relationship of LST to the green space/impervious surface fraction ratio (GS/IS fraction ratio) and the magnitude of the GS/IS fraction ratio. The SUHI intensity (SUHII) was calculated based on the temperature difference between main land use/cover categories and the temperature difference between urban-rural zones. We demarcated the rural zone based on the fraction of IS recorded, u003c10%, along with the urban-rural gradient zone. The result shows a SUHII increase from 3.9 \u00b0C in 1996 to 6.2 \u00b0C in 2017 along the urban-rural gradient between the urban and rural zones (10 u003c IS). These results relate to the rapid urban expansion of the study areas from 1996 to 2017. Most of the natural surfaces have changed to impervious surfaces, causing an increase of SUHI in Kandy City. The mean LST has a positive relationship with the fraction of IS and a negative relationship with the fraction of GS. Additionally, the GS/IS fraction ratio shows a rapid decline. Thus, the findings of this study can be considered as a proxy indicator for introducing proper landscape and urban planning for the World Heritage tropical mountain city of Kandy in Sri Lanka.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This article examines the spatial and temporal patterns of land surface temperature (LST) in Nanchang City, China in the context of the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. It also investigates the relationship of LST with six social-ecological variables, namely land use/land cover (LULC), vegetation index, impervious surface index, water index, population density, and fossil-fuel CO 2  emission. Landsat data captured in 2000 and 2013 and geographic information systems techniques were used to facilitate the analysis. The results show that the overall mean LST in the study area increased by 1.64\u00a0\u00b0C between 2000 and 2013. This temporal variation in LST might have been influenced by the given environmental conditions at the time when the source satellite images were captured. That said, there have been indications that the detected increase in the overall mean LST has been influenced by the rapid urbanization of the area, resulting in the rapid expansion of impervious surfaces and loss of green spaces. In both time points, the urban LULC class (impervious surfaces) had a consistent high LST and all the other social-ecological variables examined had statistically significant relationships with LST. We recommend that these variables be taken into consideration in the landscape and urban planning process for the future development of the city. This study also emphasizes on the importance of urban green spaces because of their ability to mitigate UHI effects and the valuable ecosystem services they generate for and provide to people. Urban green spaces can help improve the overall livability and environmental sustainability of cities.",

        "abstract": "The formation of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) can cause significant adverse impacts on the quality of living in urban areas. Monitoring the spatial patterns and trajectories of UHI formations could be helpful to urban planners in crafting appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures. This study examined the spatial pattern of SUHI formation in the Colombo District (Sri Lanka), based on land surface temperature (LST), a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and population density (PD) using a geospatial-based hot and cold spot analysis tool. Here, \u2018hot spots\u2019 refers to areas with significant spatial clustering of high variable values, while \u2018cold spots\u2019 refers to areas with significant spatial clustering of low variable values. The results indicated that between 1997 and 2017, 32.7% of the 557 divisions in the Colombo District persisted as hot spots. These hot spots were characterized by a significant clustering of high composite index values resulting from the four variables (LST, NDVI (inverted), NDBI, and PD). This study also identified newly emerging hot spots, which accounted for 49 divisions (8.8%). Large clusters of hot spots between both time points were found on the western side of the district, while cold spots were found on the eastern side of the district. The areas identified as hot spots are the more urbanized parts of the district. The emerging hot spots were in areas that had undergone landscape changes due to urbanization. Such areas are found between the persistent hot spots (western parts of the district) and persistent cold spots (eastern parts of the district). Generally, the spatial pattern of the emerging hot spots followed the pattern of urbanization in the district, which had been expanding from west to east. Overall, the findings of this study could be used as a reference in the context of sustainable landscape and urban planning for the Colombo District.",

        "abstract": "The horizontal two-dimensional (2D) urban land use approach is not sufficient to trace rapid changes in urban environment. Hence, a three-dimensional (3D) approach that is different from the traditional geographical method is necessary to understand the mechanism of compound urban diversity. Using remote sensing data captured in 2010/2011 and geospatial tools and techniques, we quantified the urban volume (UV, consisting of urban built volume (UBV) and urban green volume (UGV)) and retrieved and mapped the land surface temperature (LST) of two cities in Japan (Tsukuba, a planned city, and Tsuchiura, a traditional city). We compared these two cities in terms of (1) UBV and UGV and their relationships with mean LST; and (2) the relationship of the UGV\u2013UBV ratio with mean LST. Tsukuba had a total UBV of 74 million m 3 , while Tsuchiura had a total of 89 million m 3 . In terms of UGV, Tsukuba had a total of 52 million m 3 , while Tsuchiura had a total of 29 million m 3 . In both cities, UBV had a positive relationship with mean LST (Tsukuba: R 2 = 0.31, p u003c 0.001; Tsuchiura: R 2 = 0.42, p u003c 0.001), and UGV had a negative relationship with mean LST (Tsukuba: R 2 = 0.53, p u003c 0.001; Tsuchiura: R 2 = 0.19, p u003c 0.001). Tsukuba also had a higher UGV\u2013UBV ratio of 54.9% in comparison with Tsuchiura, with 28.7%. Overall, the results indicate that mean LST was more intense in the traditional city (Tsuchiura). This could have been due to the difference in urban spatial structure. As a planned city, Tsukuba is still a relatively young city that has more dispersed green spaces and a well-spread (so far) built-up area.",

The analysis revealed that there were 132 highly cited articles, most of which were published between 2005 and 2014. Based on author keywords, the term ecosystem services was strongly linked to biodiversity. The top three journals in terms of total number of highly cited articles published were Ecological Economics, PNAS, and Ecological Indicators. Despite ranking sixth overall, Science ranked first in both impact factor and total citations per article. The US, UK, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden were the top five most productive and cooperative countries in the world based on total number of highly cited articles and co-authorship network, respectively. The US was highly connected to Canada, the Netherlands, China and the UK. Stockholm University and Stanford University were the most productive institutions in Europe and North America, respectively. Stanford University is associated with many scholars in the field of ecosystem services research because of the InVEST model. Robert Costanza was the most prolific and highly cited author, the latter being largely due to the first valuation of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, he and his co-authors published in 1997 in Nature. Terrestrial, urban, and forest ecosystems were the top types of ecosystems assessed. Regulating and provisioning services were the major ecosystem services studied. Quantitative and qualitative assessments were the main research focus. Most of these highly cited studies on ecosystem services are done on areas geographically located in North America and Europe.",

        "abstract": "More attentions should be focused on the changes in plot size of each household rather than the size of farmland in the discussions of economic problem of land fragmentation in China. This study empirically analyzes the impact of land fragmentation and plot size on yields, along with average costs, using household survey data collected from the Jiangsu province in China. A detailed and careful translog production model and cost function are employed to understand and analyze these problems. The empirical results reveal that there are increasing returns to scale in agricultural production. Land fragmentation reduces yields through changes in marginal outputs of agricultural inputs. Especially in areas with high opportunity costs of labor, the negative impact is more obvious. A one-unit increase in the Simpson index leads to a 39% increase in the average cost, whereas a one-unit increase in plot size leads to an 8% decline in the average cost. Thus, moderate expansion of the size of the plot can reduce the average cost, implying that agriculture can achieve economies of scale within each plot. Economies of scale should be developed by keeping farm size constant, reducing the number of plots, and expanding the size of each plot. We suggest that economies of scale can be achieved in each plot by either land consolidation or land transfer as well as by joint farming and joint association.",

However, conflicts of interest among the participants make it difficult to achieve the expected goal. In this study, we first analyze the differences in the interests of the three main participants in the process of protecting cultivated land, that is, the central government, local government, and peasants. Then, we construct two evolutionary game models to examine the dynamic changes of their strategies and we compare the impacts of external factors on their strategies under different conditions using simulation analysis. The results show that, to stimulate peasants to protect cultivated land, the government should apply a relatively advanced dynamic subsidy strategy, which is able to make peasants more enthusiastic about protecting cultivated land using less time and money. The central government should provide better promotion opportunities for well-behaved local government officials, and appropriately punish uncooperative peasants and officials.",

        "abstract": "The industrial sector is a major contributor to resource consumption and environmental pollution in China. The energy-intensive industrial development and energy structure are dominated by coal, which has produced an enormous amount of industrial pollutants in China, and put great pressure on the ecological environment. Hence, improving the performance of industrial green development (PIGD) has become an urgent task of utmost importance. This study applies a global non-radial directional distance function to estimate the PIGD for Jiangxi Province during 2003\u20132015, and provides targeted policy suggestions. The empirical results show a rising trend in the PIGD in Jiangxi Province. At the city level, Nanchang and Fuzhou performed considerably better than other cities in regards to their PIGD. However, the poor environmental performance caused by the excessive discharge of industrial pollutants has also hindered its PIGD. Most cities in Jiangxi Province failed to efficiently use resources, especially energy and labor, in industrial production. The results of the influencing factor analysis show that the performance of industrial green development in Jiangxi could be improved through increasing per capita GDP, decreasing the share of coal consumption in the total industrial energy consumption, and decreasing the share of industrial GDP in the total GDP. Furthermore, a more efficient use of environmental management investment funds and timely transfer of the surplus industrial labor are needed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In recent years many households in northern Chinau0027s rural areas tend to furnish their houses with water-circulating piping system for heating, which entails mini-boiler stoves to heat water via raw coal chunk or biomass pellets. In this study, consistent efforts were made to obtain first-hand emission factors of organic carbon (EF OC ) and elemental carbon (EF EC ) for residential solid fuel combustion. A total of 39 fuel/stove combinations, covering seven coals (with different geological maturities), eleven biomass fuels, and five different stoves, were tested. The mean EF OC  and EF EC  were (4.29\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.33) and (4.43\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.18) g/kg for residential coal combustion, (2.16\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.47) and (0.42\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.01) g/kg for indoor biomass burning. The EFs for tested coal combustion display a \u201cbell shape\u201d with the maximum EF value occurring at bitumite of middle maturity. Coal briquetting in this study led to a significant decrease in EF EC  but a notable increase in EF OC , which contradicted with the result from some of previous studies that coal briquetting always leads to relatively low emissions of both OC and EC. The inside reason deserves further clarification. Averaging over the two mini-boiler stoves shows that the introduction of mini-boiler stoves can reduce 5% and 10% of OC from anthracite and bitumite, respectively, and 47% and 53% of EC from anthracite and bitumite, respectively, suggesting that transfer from pure heating stoves to mini-boiler stoves seems unlikely to increase carbonaceous particle emissions, particularly EC. The more significant decline in EF EC  than in EF OC  indicates that the access to mini-boiler stove for winter heating is very likely to be both a clean air measure and a warming mitigation approach. Updated emission inventories in China for the year of 2014 showed that the OC and EC emissions were 338\u202fGg and 529\u202fGg, respectively, from residential coal combustion, and 557\u202fGg and 79\u202fGg, respectively, from household biomass burning.",

        "abstract": "At present, to build a harmonious society is the main objective of the Chinese government. To specify, great efforts should be made to promote the harmonious development between men and nature as well as between men themselves. To implement eco-compensation has been proven to be effective for achieving the target. In fact, the Chinese government has begun the attempt of establishing eco-compensation system since the beginning of 1980\u2019s, but an improved eco-compensation system is necessary for the present in China. However, it is impractical to establish an eco-compensation system exactly up-to-date, because some necessary conditions are still not available. Fox example, the economy in China is still not strong enough, many scientific and technological problems related to the eco-compensation are unsolved, and the laws concerning eco-compensation system also lag behind time. Based on practices and experience of the past twenty years in China and also the experiences learnt from other countries, this paper suggests that the process of establishing eco-compensation system in China can be divided into three stages, which are the exploring stage, trial stage and improving stage. The exploring stage is completed at the end of the last century and it is the primary period of the trial stage at present. If the main problems restricting the establishment of the eco-compensation system could be solved in recent years, the improving stage can be approached in the 12th Five-Year Plan period. The way to improve eco-compensation system and propose a primary concept is analyzed according to the present situation in China. It is suggested that a step-by-step approach for establishing the eco-compensation system in China should be achieved on the basis of economic strength and eco-environmental situation. A primary assumption about this approach can divide the eco-compensation program into three levels: 1) preferential level (the main aim is to resolve very serious eco-environmental problems); 2) important level (the main aim is to resolve relatively serious eco-environmental problem or subsidize those behaviors protecting environment remarkable); and 3) expanding level (the main aim is to subsidize those environment-friendly behaviors friendly to a certain some degree).",

The results showed that farmers in Cixian and Zhangbei with undeveloped agricultural industrialization, has dim consciousness for environmental protection and food security; farmer mainly take into account cost during fertilization and think much of effect during pesticide application. Farmer in Longkou and Shouguang with developed agricultural industrialization has strong consciousness for environmental protection and food security; farmer tend to take crop need as principles during fertilization and is inclined to low toxicity with high effect during pesticide application. Along with industrialization of animal husbandry, more and more animal's dejecta was discarded to environment before dealing with by farmers; however, agribusinesses didn't take measures to stop the behaviors. According to analyze intrinsic reasons of the effects, the paper further brings forward eco-compensation measures dealing with pollution caused by fertilizer, pesticide and animal's dejecta from the aspect of agribusiness.",

        "abstract": "The fabrication of metal parts is the backbone of the modern manufacturing industry. Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) is combination of five common technologies: laser cladding (LC), rapid prototyping (RP), computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and powder metallurgy. The resulting process creates part by focusing an industrial laser beam on the surface of processing work piece to create a molten pool of metal. A small stream of powdered alloy is then injected into the molten pool to build up the part gradually. By moving the laser beam back and forth and tracing out a pattern determined by a CAD, the solid metal part is fabricated line by line, one layer at a time. During LAM, the design and development of powder feeder is the critical technology of LAM equipment. During the synchronous powder feeding method, the machining quality mainly depends on the machining rate, powder feeding rate, laser power density, spot diameter and powder delivery speed. The powder feeding rate and powder delivery speed are determined by the delivery features of powder feeder. In the case of constant outlet pressure of throttling valve of gas bottle, with the increase of rotary speed of powder feeding disk, the pressure at the outlet of powder feeding pipe shows the upward tendency on the whole. The faster the rotary speed, the higher the pressure at the outlet of powder feeding pipe. It can be concluded from the changing rules of powder feeding flowrate at the different outlet pressure of gas bottle and rotary speed of powder feeding disk, in order to better realize the stable control of powder feeding flowrate, the outlet pressure of gas bottle should choose the middle grade. Then, the powder feeding flowrate could be precisely adjusted by controlling the rotary speed of powder feeding disk.1",

        "abstract": "The Laser Forming Repair (LFR) is a state-of-the-art technology combining the Rapid Prototyping (RP) with the Laser Cladding (LC), which is the further application and development in the field of part repair and laser cladding. The metal powder was served as the raw material in LFR technology. LRF overcomes the shortcoming of conventional repair techniques, such as the weak bonding force and the repair position difficult to precisely control. In addition, the parts repaired by LRF possess the superior microstructure and properties. Besides, LRF removes the restriction of laser cladding technology on the shape, construct and thickness of cladding layer of parts. The factors influencing the quality of laser cladding layer are various, and there still exists many uncertain factors in the fabrication process. Therefore, the accomplishment of the best quality of cladding layer need accumulate abundant processing experience. Accordingly, it is necessary to find out the universal law between the processing parameters and the quality of laser cladding layer, build the quality prediction model suitable for the process control, and realize the control and prediction of the quality of laser cladding layer. As a result, the comprehensive investigation of quality control factors can achieve the intelligent control of laser machining process and the forecast of processing quality, reduce the technical requirements for operators, improve processing efficiency, and provide the basis for practical application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper presents a study on the effect of preparation method on the structure and photocatalytic activities of BiOI and Bi 5 O 7 I photocatalysts for elemental mercury (Hg 0 ) removal in a wet bubbling reactor. Two visible-light-driven BiOI photocatalysts (BiOI-HAc and BiOI-EG) via either glacial acetic acid (HAc) coprecipitation or ethylene glycol (EG) hydrothermal synthesis as well as their derivative samples (Bi 5 O 7 I-HAc and Bi 5 O 7 I-EG) were synthesized, respectively. The photocatalysts were characterized by N 2  adsorption-desorption analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), photoelectrochemical measurement and electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques. The results showed that Bi 5 O 7 I-HAc and BiOI-EG exhibited superior Hg 0  removal performances in comparison with BiOI-HAc and Bi 5 O 7 I-EG, and Bi 5 O 7 I-HAc photocatalyst possessed much better activity on SO 2  resistance and wider reaction temperature scope than BiOI-EG. The enhancement in Hg 0  removal efficiency can be attributed to the appearance of plenty of adsorbed oxygen, efficient photoinduced carrier separations and their special band gap structures. The photoexcited    O 2  \u2212  and h +  played key roles in the process of Hg 0  removal.",

Their activity were evaluated using toxic elemental mercury as model pollutant under fluorescent lamp irradiation. The presence of EDTA-2Na would lead to the production of Bi, facilitating an effective separation of electron and hole pairs due to the transfer of electrons from BiOI surface to Bi. The lower the I/Bi molar ratio, the higher the Hg 0  removal efficiency. The superoxide radicals and holes were the main reactive species for enhanced Hg 0  removal.",

Based on the basic connotation of resource sharing, further from the perspective of economics and systems science, some constraints of STIRs sharing were discussed. Analysis was made on the constitution of sharing cost and its constraints, including the cost constraints from the individual participants and those from the systematic level. A bidirectional optimization model for STIRs sharing and the regulating measures for sharing constraints were put forward. It is advocated that a moderate sharing objective can be achieved by combining active sharing and limited sharing, so as to maximize the utilization efficiency of STIRs.",

A water-cooling system can be employed to reduce the temperature rise and to improve the thrust density. In order to study the thermal performance of a water-cooled, 14-pole, and 12-slot PMLM, a finite-element model and thermal network model are developed. Under continuous duty, the temperature distribution of this PMLM is investigated based on the two developed models, which are validated by experimental results. The effect of the water-cooling system and the impact of its parameters on the temperature rise are investigated. Then, the influence of the temperature rise on the motor thrust force and efficiency is studied. Finally, based on the finite-element model, thermal characteristics of this PMLM under short-time duty and intermittent duty are studied, and the relationship is obtained between the operation duration and the maximum allowed short-time current, as well as the impact of load sustained rate.",

In this study we used transcriptomics to study the effect of high and low sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TM) concentrations on prophage induction, biofilm regulation, and virulence gene expression in strain PA20 under environmental conditions following 5-hour and 12-hour exposures in broth or on agar. SMX-TM at a sub-lethal concentration induced strong RecA expression resulting in concentration- and time-dependent major transcriptional shifts with emphasis on up-regulation of genes within horizontally-transferred chromosomal regions (HTR). Neither high or low levels of SMX-TM stimulated csgD expression at either time point, but both levels resulted in slight repression. Full expression of Ler-dependent genes paralleled expression of group 1 pch homologues in the presence of high glrA. Finally, stx2 expression, which is strongly dependent on prophage induction, was enhanced at 12 hours but repressed at five hours, in spite of early SOS initiation by the high SMX-TM concentration. Our findings indicate that, similar to host conditions, exposure to environmental conditions increased the expression of virulence genes in a clinical isolate but genes involved in the protective biofilm response were repressed.",

        "abstract": "The Notch signaling pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of human cancers, including hematopoietic malignancies. Its functions are highly dependent on the specific cellular context. Gain-of-function NOTCH1 mutations are prevalent in human T-cell leukemia, while loss of Notch signaling is reported in myeloid leukemias. Here, we report a novel oncogenic function of Notch signaling in oncogenic Kras-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). We find that downregulation of Notch signaling in hematopoietic cells via DNMAML expression or Pofut1 deletion significantly blocks MPN development in Kras mice in a cell-autonomous manner. Further mechanistic studies indicate that inhibition of Notch signaling upregulates Dusp1, a dual phosphatase that inactivates p-ERK, and downregulates cytokine-evoked ERK activation in Kras cells. Moreover, mitochondrial metabolism is greatly enhanced in Kras cells but significantly reprogrammed by DNMAML close to that in control cells. Consequently, cell proliferation and expanded myeloid compartment in Kras mice are significantly reduced. Consistent with these findings, combined inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation effectively inhibited the growth of human and mouse leukemia cells in vitro. Our study provides a strong rational to target both ERK signaling and aberrant metabolism in oncogenic Ras-driven myeloid leukemia.",

        "abstract": "Somatic mutations in  TP53  and  NRAS  are associated with transformation of human chronic myeloid diseases to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we report that concurrent  RAS  pathway and  TP53  mutations are identified in a subset of AML patients and confer an inferior overall survival. To further investigate the genetic interaction between  p53  loss and endogenous  Nras  G12D/+  in AML, we generated conditional  Nras  G12D/+  p53  \u2212/\u2212  mice. Consistent with the clinical data, recipient mice transplanted with  Nras  G12D/+  p53  \u2212/\u2212  bone marrow cells rapidly develop a highly penetrant AML. We find that  p53  \u2212/\u2212  cooperates with  Nras  G12D/+  to promote increased quiescence in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs).  Nras  G12D/+  p53  \u2212/\u2212  MEPs are transformed to self-renewing AML-initiating cells and are capable of inducing AML in serially transplanted recipients. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that transformed MEPs gain a partial hematopoietic stem cell signature and largely retain an MEP signature. Their distinct transcriptomes suggests a potential regulation by  p53  loss. In addition, we show that during AML development, transformed MEPs acquire overexpression of oncogenic  Nras , leading to hyperactivation of ERK1/2 signaling. Our results demonstrate that  p53  \u2212/\u2212  synergizes with enhanced oncogenic Nras signaling to transform MEPs and drive AML development. This model may serve as a platform to test candidate therapeutics in this aggressive subset of AML.",
