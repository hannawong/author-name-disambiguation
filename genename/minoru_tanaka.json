        "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) display distinct structural and functional characteristics depending on the tissue and developmental stage; however, the development of tissue-specific ECs remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the development of hepatic sinusoids in mice based on the expression of hyaluronan receptors Stab2 and Lyve-1. Flk-1(+) cells in and around the liver bud begin to express Stab2 at embryonic day (E) 9.5, before the formation of vascular lumen. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) begin to express Lyve-1 at E10.5, and both markers continue to be expressed in HSECs thereafter. Although HSECs and lymphatic ECs (LECs) are known to share functional and phenotypic characteristics, we clearly show that HSECs can be distinguished from LECs by the expression of molecular markers and higher endocytotic activity. Our results provide new insight into the development of tissue-specific ECs and phenotypic criteria to distinguish HSECs from other types of ECs, including LECs.",

        "title": "Genetic analysis of typical wet-type age-related macular degeneration and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy in Japanese population.",
        "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of blindness in the elderly. Caucasian patients are predominantly affected by the dry form of AMD, whereas Japanese patients have predominantly the wet form of AMD and/or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Although genetic association in the 10q26 (ARMS2/HTRA1) region has been established in many ethnic groups for dry-type AMD, typical wet-type AMD, and PCV, the contribution of the 1q32 (CFH) region seem to differ among these groups. Here we show a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ARMS2/HTRA1 locus is associated in the whole genome for Japanese typical wet-type AMD (rs10490924: p = 4.1 x 10(-4), OR = 4.16) and PCV (rs10490924: p = 3.7 x 10(-8), OR = 2.72) followed by CFH (rs800292: p = 7.4 x 10(-5), OR = 2.08; p = 2.6 x 10(-4), OR = 2.00), which differs from previous studies in Caucasian populations. Moreover, a SNP (rs2241394) in complement component C3 gene showed significant association with PCV (p = 2.5 x 10(-3), OR = 3.47). We conclude that dry-type AMD, typical wet-type AMD, and PCV have both common and distinct genetic risks that become apparent when comparing Japanese versus Caucasian populations.

        "abstract": "In vertebrates, there is accumulating evidence that environmental factors as triggers for sex determination and genetic sex determination are not two opposing alternatives but that a continuum of mechanisms bridge those extremes. One prominent example is the model fish species Oryzias latipes which has a stable XX/XY genetic sex determination system, but still responds to environmental cues, where high temperatures lead to female-to-male sex reversal. However, the mechanisms behind are still unknown. We show that high temperatures increase primordial germ cells (PGC) numbers before they reach the genital ridge, which, in turn, regulates the germ cell proliferation. Complete ablation of PGCs led to XX males with germ cell less testis, whereas experimentally increased PGC numbers did not reverse XY genotypes to female. For the underlying molecular mechanism, we provide support for the explanation that activation of the dmrt1a gene by cortisol during early development of XX embryos enables this autosomal gene to take over the role of the male determining Y-chromosomal dmrt1bY.",

The new contact lens is made of quartz. The lens is convex-concave and is used in combination with slit illumination from an operating microscope. The optical properties of quartz make this lens less reflective with greater transmittance. The combination of a quartz contact lens with slit illumination provided a brighter and wider field of view than conventional lenses. This system enabled us to perform bimanual vitrectomy and scleral buckling surgery without indirect ophthalmoscope. Small intraocular structures in the posterior pole or in the periphery were detected more easily. In conclusion, the newly designed quartz lens with slit beam illumination from an operating microscope provided a bright, clear and wide surgical field, and allowed intraocular surgery to be performed more easily.",

All patients underwent a standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy to remove the ERM removal and cataract surgery. pVEPs were elicited by check sizes of 15', 30', 60', and 120' with a reversal rate of 2 reversals/s. One hundred responses were averaged with an analysis time of 300 ms. The amplitude ratio (affected eye/fellow eye) of the P100 component were significantly larger at 6 months with smaller check sizes, and the increase was accompanied by an improvement of the VA. The mean peak latency of P100 did not change significantly for all check sizes. We conclude that the improvement of the P100 amplitude with smaller check sizes resulted from the recovery of visual function after the ERM removal.",

Screening was performed on larvae at 8 days posthatching for abnormal abundance and/or distribution of germ cells detected by the in situ hybridization for olvas (Medaka vasa). We describe here 16 mutants of 13 genes, which are classified into four groups. Group 1, consisting of four mutants of three genes kon, tot) characterised by an increase in germ cell number. An adult tot homozygote fish has the characteristic feature of possessing hypertrophic gonads filled with immature oocytes. Group 2, represented by a single gene (zen) mutant characterized by a gradual loss of germ cells. Group 3, consisting of four mutants of distinct genes (eko, eki, sht, ano) showing irregular clustering of germ cells. Group 4, consisting of seven mutants of five genes (arr, hyo, mzr, hdr, fbk) showing fragmented clusters of germ cells.

        "abstract": "The preoperative and postoperative factors influencing visual outcome were analyzed in 15 eyes of 15 patients with graft opacity after keratoplasty associated with vitreoretinal disease who underwent combined surgery of fresh corneal retransplantation and vitrectomy.The data obtained consisted of diagnosis, preoperative visual acuity, corneal and vitreoretinal findings at the time of surgery, interval between the first visit and surgery, intraocular pressure before surgery, gonioscopic findings, results of bacterial culture of surgical specimens, surgical procedure for vitrectomy, corneal and vitreous findings after surgery, visual acuity 6 months after surgery, intraocular pressure after surgery, and additional surgical techniques.The cause of corneal opacity was graft rejection in all patients, who had been treated with high-dose administrations of steroids and cyclosporin. The preoperative diagnosis was proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in eight eyes and fungal endophthalmitis in seven eyes. Corneal transparency was achieved in 7 eyes (46.6%) 6 months after surgery. Vitreoretinal findings improved in 9 eyes (60%) and PVR recurred in 6 eyes (40%). Visual acuity improved in 7 eyes (46.6%), did not change in 2 eyes (13.3%), and deteriorated in 6 eyes (40%). The six eyes with decreased visual acuity developed phthisis bulbi. Preoperative intraocular pressure was 2.1 mmHg on average in the phthisis bulbi group, significantly lower than in the group with superior prognosis. Goniosynechia was noted before surgery and did not improve after surgery in all six eyes.The outcome was poor in eyes with goniosynechia and ocular hypotony, and combined surgery is not indicated for either anatomic or visual preservation in such cases. Care should be taken not to overlook intraocular infection in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy against graft rejection. The early detection of retinal detachment is also important in eyes exhibiting hypotony after surgery.",

        "abstract": "The Super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data suggest existence of the large\nlepton-flavor violating (LFV) interaction in the higher energy scale. If the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model is extended to have right-handed\nneutrinos, the left-handed sleptons in the second and third generations are\nexpected to have the LFV masses in the minimal supergravity scenario. In this\narticle we study the LFV signals in the left-handed slepton production at\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-$ colliders and $\\e^+\\e^-$ linear colliders (LC's),\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-(\\e^+\\e^-)\\to\\tau\\mu +4jets + \\E$ and\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-(\\e^+\\e^-)\\to\\tau\\mu l+ 2jets+ \\E$. The main background comes from\ndecay of a tau lepton into a muon in the lepton-flavor conserving slepton pair\nproduction. They are significantly reduced by the energy and the impact\nparameter cuts for the muon. At $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ colliders (LC's) it may be\npossible to reach the mixing angle $\\sin 2\\theta_{\\tilde{\\nu}} \\gsim 0.1(0.5)$\nand the mass difference $\\Delta m_{\\tilde{\\nu}}\\gsim 0.1(0.4)$ GeV for the\nsneutrinos in the second and third generations at the statistical significance\nof $3\\sigma$. Such small mass difference and a mixing angle may be induced\nradiatively even if the Yukawa coupling constant for the tau neutrino is of the\norder of 0.1.",

The analytes in water, sediment and biological samples were extracted into 0.1% tropolone-benzene solution after adding hydrochloric acid diluted with tetrahydrofuran. With sediment samples, inorganic sulphur-containing species co-extracted with the analytes were removed with tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulphate-sodium sulphide, which brought about a decrease in many of the accompanying peaks. After propylation with n -propylmagnesium bromide, the analytes were determined by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection. The recoveries were in the range 70–100% and the detection limits for a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 were 3 ng 1 −1 in water samples and 0.5 μg kg −1 in sediment and biological samples.",

        "abstract": "Although many studies have been published on the risk factors and therapies for endogenous fungal endophthalmitis (EFE), only a few have been published on the relationship between the stage of EFE at the initial examination and the prognosis. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the relation between the stage of EFE at the initial examination and the prognosis.A total of 103 eyes of 58 patients (40 men, 18 women) with EFE, examined over a 20-year period (1984-2004), were studied. The severity of the EFE at the initial examination was classified into four stages. In addition, the type of fungus, general status, initial and final visual acuity, findings of the anterior and posterior segments, latent fungal infection, duration from initial symptoms to initial visit, history of intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH), results of the Candida Detection System, and beta-D-glucan levels were analyzed.More than 95% of the patients had some type of underlying disorder. Candida albicans was detected initially in the blood in 40 patients. The stage of the EFE advanced as the time from the initial symptoms to the beginning of therapy increased. The final visual acuity was significantly correlated with the stage of EFE at the initial examination. In 20 of 21 patients, blood beta-D-glucan was positive, and 42 patients (90%) were receiving IVH.Because the stage of EFE advanced with the time between the initial symptoms and the beginning of therapy, and because of the high correlation between the stage of EFE and the final visual acuity, it is very important that treatment be begun as soon as possible. Thus, in patients with visual symptoms and susceptible to opportunistic infections, an early consultation with an ophthalmologist is highly recommended.",

Before operation, electrophysiological abnormalities were detected in 20 (79%) of the 28 patients. Preoperative comparison of the mean value in each parameter between the two age groups showed higher values in all parameters in the older group. In 17 patients who underwent operation, atrial-His interval, Wenckebach cycle length, CSNRT, and atrial effective refractory period (AERP) significantly decreased after operation; preoperatively abnormal Wenckebach cycle length, CSNRT, and AERP values were normalized in many of them. Thus, electrophysiological abnormalities were already present before operation in the ASD children and were severer in the older children, but were improved to some degree following operation.",

Assuming that tree level decay amplitudes are dominated by the standard model ones, new physics contribution to the B- ¯ B mixing can be extracted from several measurements atB factories. Using this framework, we show the present constraint on new physics contribution to the B- ¯ B mixing, and illustrate constraints expected to be given by future experiments at B factories. We also point out a possibility that CP asymmetries in B ! KS, B ! ��, and B ! DK modes look consistent with the standard model, even if a large new physics contribution is present in the B- ¯ B mixing.",

        "abstract": "Medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a small freshwater teleost fish that serves as a model vertebrate organism in various fields of biology including development, genetics, toxicology and evolution. The recent completion of the medaka genome sequencing project has promoted the use of medaka as a comparative and complementary material for research on other vertebrates such as zebrafish, sticklebacks, mice, and humans. The Japanese government has supported the development of Medaka Bioresources since 2002. The second term of the Medaka Bioresource Project started in 2007. The National Institute for Basic Biology and Niigata University were selected as the core organizations for this project. More than 400 strains including more than 300 spontaneous and induced mutants, 8 inbred lines, 21 transgenic lines, 20 medaka-related species and 66 wild stock lines of medaka are now being provided to the scientific community and educational non-profit organizations. In addition to these live fish, NBRP Medaka is also able to provide cDNA/EST clones such as full-length cDNA and BAC/fosmid clones covering 90% of the medaka genome. All these resources can be found on the NBRP Medaka website (http://shigen.lab.nig.ac.jp/medaka/), and users can order any resource using the shopping cart system. We believe these resources will facilitate the further use of medaka and help to promote new findings for this vertebrate species.",

The aim of this\narticle is to prove splitting theorems of two types as an application.\nMoreover, we establish a weaker version of our Toponogov comparison theorem for\nopen triangles, because the weaker version is quite enough to prove one of the\nsplitting theorems.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel method of calculating the sensitivity of the manufacturing system throughput to the variables of the machines. The sensitivity analysis needs only a single simulation, yet is easy to use and provides accurate results. This sensitivity analysis is then used to predict the change in the system throughput due to a change of the variables of the machines provided that the system change does not significantly change the bottleneck. These predictions can be used for a local optimization, allowing the use of a steepest descent optimization algorithm. The method is based on improving the momentary shifting bottlenecks. The shifting bottlenecks are detected using the shifting bottleneck detection method based on the active duration, i.e., the time a machine is active without interruption. The method is easy to understand and easy to implement in existing simulation software.",

Wild sugarcane, Saccharum spontaneum, is known to be a key breeding material to obtain high-yielding clones. In this study, we sought to identify Japanese wild sugarcane accessions with high resistance to smut. Thirty wild sugarcanes and three sugarcane cultivars were tested by the pinprick method. The results of the inoculation tests aided in identifying wild sugarcanes with high resistance to smut disease, namely JW90, Iriomote8, and Iriomote15. After screening the germplasm, progeny distribution of smut resistance from the inoculation test and dry matter productivity in the smut disease-free field were compared. The highly resistant wild sugarcane accession had a much better impact on progeny distribution of smut resistance compared with the susceptible accession. No relationship was found between smut resistance and dry matter productivity in both populations.",

First, the operator can perform three-dimensional visual programming based on our object-oriented language. Due to the flexibility of the language, the operator can easily apply the system to various tasks. Second, the operator can describe the failure recovery sequence separately from the main task sequence and automatically generate a detailed command sequence with a part sending a signal from the robot to the peripheral equipment and vice versa. These procedures are easy; the operator can perform them as if giving directions to a person to do so. Third, the operator can automatically develop a collision avoidance trajectory. It's generated by the original algorithm which efficiently operates as an off-line teaching system. We will introduce our recent approaches for establishing the new teaching system and discuss the applicability of the system in this paper",

Hence, our main theorem has various advantages of the Cheeger–Colding diffeomorphism theorem via the Euclidean volume growth.

        "abstract": "Retrograde cerebral perfusion through a superior vena caval cannula is a new technique for protecting the brain during aortic arch operations. In mongrel dogs (n = 10; 13 to 15 kg) we have performed retrograde cerebral perfusion (300 mL/min) by infusing blood through a superior vena caval cannula with aortic and inferior vena caval drainage. We have measured the cerebral tissue blood flow, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide exudation during retrograde cerebral perfusion at normothermia (NT, 37 degrees C) and hypothermia (HT, 20 degrees C) and have compared these values with values obtained in dogs during cardiopulmonary bypass (1,200 mL/min). Cerebral tissue blood flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance method. During retrograde cerebral perfusion about 20% of the superior vena caval perfusate was returned through the aorta and the rest drained from the inferior vena cava. Cerebral vascular resistance during retrograde cerebral perfusion was lower than that during cardiopulmonary bypass (NT, 63.8 +/- 52.5 versus 126.9 +/- 58.4; HT, 28.4 +/- 32.8 versus 69.5 +/- 28.7 x 10(3) dynes.s.cm(-5). Retrograde cerebral perfusion provided half the cerebral tissue blood flow of cardiopulmonary bypass (NT, 14.7 +/- 6.4 versus 34.3 +/- 7.8; HT, 17.6 +/- 5.6 versus 37.2 +/- 10.6 mL/min). Retrograde cerebral perfusion also provided a third of the oxygen (NT, 4.4 +/- 2.1 versus 12.3 +/- 7.1; HT, 1.4 +/- 0.8 versus 4.2 +/- 1.3 mL/min) and discharged 20% of the carbon dioxide (NT, 0.24 +/- 0.08 versus 1.19 +/- 0.58; HT, 0.15 +/- 0.06 versus 0.51 +/- 0.17 mmol/min) when compared with cardiopulmonary bypass.

        "abstract": "The chiral separation of five pairs of several amino acid enantiomers was examined by capillary zone electrophoresis using three selectively acetylated and methylated β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) derivatives. After acetylation of the hydroxyl groups of β-CD, its enantioselectivity completely disappeared for α- and β-naphthalenesulfonylamino acids. For dansylamino acids, several solutes were resolved only with heptakis(2,3-di- O -acetyl and 2,3-di- O -methyl)-β-CDs. The chiral recognition abilities of selectively acetylated and methylated β-CD derivatives were similar for dansylamino acids and α- and β-naphthalenesulfonylamino acids. Heptakis(3-mono- and 3,6-di- O -methyl)-β-CDs exhibited quite high chiral recognition abilities for α-naphthoylamino acids. On the other hand, β-naphthoylamino acids were resolved better in the presence of unmodified β-CD and heptakis(3-mono- and 3,6-di- O -acetyl)-β-CDs. Neither heptakis(2,3-di- O -acetyl nor 2,3-di- O -methyl)-β-CD could resolve α- and β-naphthoylamino acids at all.",

The right eyes were irradiated with carbon beam (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 Gy) or proton beam (4, 8, 16, and 24 Gy) with the rats under general anesthesia. Electroretinograms were recorded 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the irradiation, and the amplitudes of the a and b waves were compared with those of control rats.The amplitude of b waves was reduced more than that of a waves at lower irradiation doses with both types of irradiation. With carbon ion irradiation, the amplitudes of the b wave were significantly reduced after radiation doses of 8 and 16 Gy at 6 months and by radiation doses of 4, 8, and 16 Gy at 12 months. With proton beam irradiation, the b-wave amplitudes were significantly reduced after 16 and 24 Gy at 6 months and with doses of 8 Gy or greater at 12 months. For the maximum b-wave amplitude, a significant difference was observed in rats irradiated with carbon beams of 4 Gy or more and with proton beams of 8 Gy or more at 12 months after irradiation.These results indicate that carbon beam irradiation is about two times more damaging than proton beam irradiation on the rat retina at the same dose.",

The spatio-temporal expression pattern of olvas transcripts was observed by in situ hybridization on gonads and embryos. The transcripts for olvas were exclusively detected in the cytoplasm of germ cells in the testis and ovary, not in gonadal somatic cells. In the early developmental stages, each blastomere possessed the maternal transcripts of olvas, which disappeared during gastrula stages. At the late gastrula stage, specific expression of olvas was observed only in germline cells located at the posterior shield. Embryos after the hybridization were examined histologically, and the distribution and migration path of primordial germ cells (PGC) during early stages of embryonic-body formation were revealed using the olvas gene as a germline cell marker. The PGC were translocated from the posterior shield to both sides of the embryonic body via the inner embryonic body in the medaka.",

        "title": "Transcriptional rewiring of the sex determining dmrt1 gene duplicate by transposable elements.",
        "abstract": "Control and coordination of eukaryotic gene expression rely on transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory networks. Evolutionary innovations and adaptations often require rapid changes of such networks. It has long been hypothesized that transposable elements (TE) might contribute to the rewiring of regulatory interactions. More recently it emerged that TEs might bring in ready-to-use transcription factor binding sites to create alterations to the promoters by which they were captured. A process where the gene regulatory architecture is of remarkable plasticity is sex determination. While the more downstream components of the sex determination cascades are evolutionary conserved, the master regulators can switch between groups of organisms even on the interspecies level or between populations. In the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) a duplicated copy of dmrt1, designated dmrt1bY or DMY, on the Y chromosome was shown to be the master regulator of male development, similar to Sry in mammals. We found that the dmrt1bY gene has acquired a new feedback downregulation of its expression. Additionally, the autosomal dmrt1a gene is also able to regulate transcription of its duplicated paralog by binding to a unique target Dmrt1 site nested within the dmrt1bY proximal promoter region. We could trace back this novel regulatory element to a highly conserved sequence within a new type of TE that inserted into the upstream region of dmrt1bY shortly after the duplication event. Our data provide functional evidence for a role of TEs in transcriptional network rewiring for sub- and/or neo-functionalization of duplicated genes. In the particular case of dmrt1bY, this contributed to create new hierarchies of sex-determining genes.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral, renal, and hepatic blood flows and oxygen metabolism were measured in 8 mongrel dogs undergoing hypothermic (20 degrees C) retrograde perfusion via the inferior vena cava (IVC) and compared with cardiopulmonary bypass and retrograde superior vena caval perfusion. Inferior vena caval perfusion was performed with aortic drainage and clamping of the superior vena cava at an IVC pressure of 20 or 30 mm Hg. Cerebral, renal, and hepatic blood flows at 30 mm Hg of IVC pressure were 7.5 +/- 3.8, 8.1 +/- 3.1, and 15.3 +/- 5.5 mL.min-1.100 g-1, respectively, as determined by the hydrogen clearance method. Organ blood flows during retrograde IVC perfusion were 28%, 42%, and 57% of cardiopulmonary bypass values at a flow rate of 1,000 mL/min and 61%, 119%, and 131% of retrograde superior vena caval perfusion values at 30 mm Hg of superior vena caval pressure, respectively. Oxygen consumption was 7.4 +/- 3.7 mL/min. At an IVC pressure of 20 mm Hg, cerebral, renal, and hepatic blood flows and oxygen consumption were 5.1 +/- 2.7, 5.9 +/- 4.1, and 11.6 +/- 4.0 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1 and 3.0 +/- 0.8 mL/min. As IVC pressure increased, cerebral, renal, and hepatic blood flows and oxygen consumption increased. However, high IVC pressure was associated with high portal venous pressure, which may produce ascites. Regional blood flow during retrograde IVC perfusion was measured by the colored microsphere method in another 8 normothermic dogs. Inferior vena caval perfusion at 30 mm Hg supplied adequate blood flow to the liver (15.44 +/- 12.1 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1) and kidneys (6.35 +/- 2.0 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The development of germ cells has been intensively studied in Medaka (Oryzias latipes). We have undertaken a large-scale screen to identify mutations affecting the development of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in Medaka. Embryos derived from mutagenized founder fish were screened for an abnormal distribution or number of PGCs at embryonic stage 27 by RNA in situ hybridization for the Medaka vasa homologue (olvas). At this stage, PGCs coalesce into two bilateral vasa-expressing foci in the ventrolateral regions of the trunk after their migration and group organization. Nineteen mutations were identified from a screen corresponding to 450 mutagenized haploid genomes. Eleven of the mutations caused altered PGC distribution. Most of these alterations were associated with morphological abnormalities and could be grouped into four phenotypic classes: Class 1, PGCs dispersed into bilateral lines; Class 2, PGCs dispersed in a region more medial than that in Class 1; Class 3, PGCs scattered laterally and over the yolk sac area; and Class 4, PGCs clustered in a single median focus. Eight mutations caused a decrease in the number of PGCs. This decrease was observed in the offspring of heterozygous mothers, indicating the contribution of a maternal factor in determining PGC abundance. Taken together, these mutations should prove useful in identifying molecular mechanisms underlying the early PGC development and migration.",

Here, we investigated a possible involvement of Wnt signaling during mouse oval cell response and found significant upregulation of several Wnt genes including Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and Wnt10a. Accordingly, increase of beta-catenin protein was observed in oval cell compartments. Pharmacological activation of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling induced proliferation of cultured hepatic stem/progenitor cell lines. These results together implicate the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in adult hepatic stem/progenitor cell response.",

        "abstract": "Native and three selectively methylated β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-bonded stationary phases without an unreacted spacer arm for liquid chromatography were prepared, where heptakis(2- O -methyl)-β-CD, heptakis(3- O -methyl)-β-CD and heptakis(2,3-di- O -methyl)-β-CD were used as the methylated β-CDs. The enantiomer separation abilities of the resulting β-CD stationary phases for 12 pairs of dansylamino acid enantiomers and six pairs of N -3,5-dinitrobenzoyl amino acid methyl esters as model solutes were investigated. The effects of pH and methanol content of the mobile phase on the retention and resolution were examined to optimize the mobile phase conditions. The optimum resolution for the dansylamino acids was achieved using a mobile phase consisting of 1.0% triethylammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0)–methanol (v/v 4/6) on the β-CD stationary phase. Heptakis(3- O -methyl)- and heptakis(2,3-di- O -methyl)-β-CD-bonded stationary phases showed little enantiomer separation abilities for the dansylamino acids. The heptakis(2- O -methyl)-β-CD-bonded stationary phase exhibited no enantioselectivities for those solutes. For the N -3,5-dinitrobenzoyl amino acid methyl esters, the optimum resolution was achieved using a mobile phase consisting of 1.0% triethylammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0)–methanol (v/v 9/1) on a heptakis(2- O -methyl)-β-CD stationary phase. The heptakis(2,3-di- O -methyl)-β-CD-bonded stationary phases exhibited no enantioselectivities for the N -3,5-dinitrobenzoyl amino acid methyl esters. β-CD and heptakis(3- O -methyl)-β-CD-bonded stationary phases had no enantiomer separation abilities for those solutes except for the N -3,5-dinitrobenzoyl phenylalanine methyl ester.",

        "abstract": "We performed in ovo nanoinjection of 4-nonylphenol (NP) into embryos of a transgenic see-through medaka (Oryzias latipes), olvas-GFP/STII-YI strain, which has two genotypic sex markers, and examined the effects on development and sexual differentiation. The transgene consisted of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fused to the regulatory region of the medaka vasa gene. Germ cell-specific GFP expression was visualized in the gonad through the transparent body wall of the living fish. The development of each embryo was observed after nanoinjection of 2.0, 10, 50, 125, or 250 ng of NP. NP administration caused significant higher mortality at > or = 50 ng egg(-1) and inhibited embryonic development, including abnormal hatch and swim-up failure in all treatment groups except 10 ng egg(-1) group. However, it did not cause adverse effects on germ cell proliferation by 10d posthatch (dph) or sex differentiation of survivors by 100 dph. We concluded that single-dose in ovo exposure to nonylphenol affected embryonic development in the medaka but not gonadal development by 10 dph or sexual differentiation in adult fish by 100 dph. Although further investigations might be needed to elucidate the usefulness of nanoinjection of embryos of this strain, present study indicated that the nanoinjection model using olvas-GFP/STII-YI strain medaka has potential for use in evaluating the effects of chemicals on early development and sexual differentiation.",

We evaluate\nCP asymmetries in various B decay modes, $\\Delta m_{B_s}$, $\\Delta m_{B_d}$,\nand $\\epsilon_K$. The allowed regions of the CP asymmetry in $B\\to J/\\psi K_S$\nand $\\Delta m_{B_s}/\\Delta m_{B_d}$ are different for the three models so that\nprecise determinations of these observables in near future experiments are\nuseful to distinguish the three models. We also investigate possible deviations\nfrom the standard model predictions of CP asymmetries in other B decay modes.\nIn particular, a large deviation is possible for the U(2) model. The\nconsistency check of the unitarity triangle including $B\\to\n\\pi\\pi,\\rho\\pi,D^{(*)}K^{(*)},D^{(*)}\\pi,D^{*}\\rho$, and so on, at future high\nluminosity $e^+e^-$ $B$ factories and hadronic $B$ experiments is therefore\nimportant to distinguish flavor structures of different supersymmetric models.",

        "abstract": "We have previously shown that pertussis-toxin-sensitive inhibitory guanine-nucleotide-binding-regulatory proteins (G proteins) are involved in the signal transduction of steroidal maturation-inducing hormone (MIH) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) oocytes, 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17alpha,20beta-DP) [Yoshikuni, M. & Nagahama, Y. (1994) Dev. Biol. 166, 615-622]. In this study, we obtained five different cDNA fragments of G protein alpha subunits from medaka (Oryzias latipes) intact ovarian follicles (three subtypes of G(i alpha), G(i alpha a), G(i alpha b) and G(i alpha c); two subtypes of G(s alpha), G(s alpha d), and G(s alpha e)). Using a newly developed extraction method for medaka oocyte RNA, we demonstrated that oocytes expressed both G(i alpha a) and G(i alpha c), but not G(i alpha b). Full-length cDNA clones for G(i alpha a) and G(i alpha c) were then isolated from a medaka ovarian follicle cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequences of G(i alpha a) and G(i alpha c) exhibited significant similarity with G(i alpha1) and G(i alpha2) of other species, respectively. Both G(i alpha a) and G(i alpha c) possessed a specific Cys residue in the C-terminal region that was the site for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. G(o alpha), another G protein that is ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, was not detected in oocytes, although it was expressed in brain tissue. Western blot analyses using a specific antibody against G(i alpha1) and G(i alpha2) subunit proteins revealed that in both medaka and rainbow trout G(i alpha) subunit protein (40 kDa) contents were abundant in plasma membranes of postvitellogenic immature oocytes, decreased in mature oocytes, and were absent in ovulated eggs. Furthermore, specific 17alpha,20beta-DP binding to plasma membranes was higher in postvitellogenic immature oocytes than in ovulated eggs. Taken together, these results suggest that G(i alpha a) and/or G(i alpha c) may be involved in the transduction of the signal from 17alpha,20beta-DP receptors during oocyte maturation of fish oocytes.",

Here we describe a streamlined procedure for selecting BAC clones based on the medaka University of Tokyo genome browser (UTGB), followed by rapid modification with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or DsRed fragments for transgenic analysis in medaka. Experimental procedures for BAC DNA preparation, microinjection of medaka embryos and screening of resulting transgenic medaka carrying EGFP/DsRed modified BAC clones are also described.",

The 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of eukaryotic genes can contain motifs involved in regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In the 3'-UTR of dmrt1, a key gene that functions in gonad development and differentiation, an 11-bp protein-binding motif was identified that mediates gonad-specific mRNA localization during embryonic and larval development of fish. Mutations that disrupt the 11-bp motif leading to in vitro protein-binding loss and selective transcript stabilization failure indicate a role for this motif in RNA stabilization through protein binding. The sequence motif was found to be conserved in most of the dmrt1 homologous genes from flies to humans suggesting a widespread conservation of this specific mechanism.",

Yet, while an increase in the buffer size usually increases the throughput, it often also increases the work in progress and the makespan, therefore increasing the inventory and the time to the customer. Subsequently, the trade off between the throughput, the work in progress, and the makespan are of significant research interest. This paper describes a general prediction model of these performance measures for different buffer size increases based on only a single simulation. A fully automated implementation of the simulation analysis and prediction model for manufacturing systems of any size and complexity is available. The method can be used for flow shops, job shops, and serial or parallel systems.",

        "abstract": "To cope with seasonal environmental changes, animals adapt their physiology and behaviour in response to photoperiod. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptive changes are not completely understood. Here, using genome-wide expression analysis, we show that an uncharacterized long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), LDAIR, is strongly regulated by photoperiod in Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). Numerous transcripts and signalling pathways are activated during the transition from short- to long-day conditions; however, LDAIR is one of the first genes to be induced and its expression shows a robust daily rhythm under long-day conditions. Transcriptome analysis of LDAIR knockout fish reveals that the LDAIR locus regulates a gene neighbourhood, including corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2, which is involved in the stress response. Behavioural analysis of LDAIR knockout fish demonstrates that LDAIR affects self-protective behaviours under long-day conditions. Therefore, we propose that photoperiodic regulation of corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2 by LDAIR modulates adaptive behaviours to seasonal environmental changes.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of germ cells becomes sexually dimorphic during gonadal sex differentiation, although the underlying dynamics of this are not well understood in vertebrates. By tracing GFP-labeled germ cells in vivo and analyzing the germ cell-depleted mutant, zenzai, we show that the proliferation and differentiation of germ cells are regulated in a sexually dimorphic manner in the teleost fish medaka. In the undifferentiated gonads, germ cells resume proliferation by slow intermittent division (type I), producing isolated daughter cells. While germ cells in the male gonads continue this mode of proliferation, some germ cell fractions in the female gonads initiate two to four rounds of continuous division (type II), forming cysts of four, eight, or sixteen cells, which subsequently enter meiosis synchronously. Thus, female germ cells become differentiated much earlier than do male germ cells. In the zenzai mutant, a defect in slow intermittent division eventually leads to the depletion of germ cells in the adult gonads in both sexes, despite the fact that cyst-forming division is unaffected. This argues that slow intermittent division is essential for the maintenance of germ cells. The proliferation and differentiation of germ cells are thus important components of gonadal sex differentiation in vertebrates.",

In the germ cells of the gonadal primordia, these granules formed a hollow area lacking these three protein components. During the sexual differentiation of the female gonads, the granules were found to be reduced in size in the germ cells undergoing cystic division and they showed a perinuclear localization in the oocytes. However, the germ cells in the male gonads retained their hollow granules during this early sex differentiation stage. We further demonstrate the differential localization of olvas, nanos, and tdrd1 on these granules during medaka germline development.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the best recording time to measure the retinal thickness with the OCT ophthalmoscope. In addition, the accuracy of the measurements was examined by comparing the values obtained by the OCT ophthalmoscope with those obtained with the Stratus OCT Model 3000 (OCT III) assuming that the OCT III gives an accurate measurement of retinal thickness.The topography mode of the OCT ophthalmoscope was used. First, the average retinal thickness recorded with 2-s scans was compared with that recorded with 4-s scans for a recording area of 15 degreesx15 degrees. Next, the average retinal thickness recorded by the OCT ophthalmoscope was compared with that obtained by the Fast Macular Thickness program of the OCT III in patients with macular oedema.The mean retinal thickness of the central area was 208.1 microm for both 2 and 4 s recording times. The average retinal thickness obtained by the OCT ophthalmoscope was highly correlated and not significantly different from the values obtained by the OCT III. The largest differences obtained by the two instruments were seen in the parts of the retina with accumulation of hard exudates.Accurate measurements of retinal thickness can be obtained with the OCT ophthalmoscope by 2-s scans, and thus, the OCT ophthalmoscope can be a valuable instrument for clinical assessments of retinal thickness.",

Most importantly, an increased amount of miR-500 was found in the sera of the HCC patients. In fact, miR-500 levels in sera of the HCC patients returned to normal after the surgical treatment in three HCC patients. Our findings reveal that diverse changes of miRNAs occur during liver development and, one of these, miR-500 is an oncofetal miRNA relevant to the diagnosis of human HCC.",

Fellow eyes were injected with the same volume of BSS. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopic fundus examinations, A- and B-mode ultrasonography, and electroretinography were performed to assess the retina. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded up to 90 days after injection. Morphologic alterations were assessed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy.A slight aqueous flare and cells were observed in the anterior chamber after microplasmin and BSS injection. A slight inflammatory reaction was also observed transiently in the vitreous cavity. In control eyes, B-mode ultrasonography and SEM examination demonstrated that PVD did not develop after BSS injection. Intravitreal injections of 125 microg or greater of microplasmin induced complete PVD with an internal limiting membrane (ILM) devoid of vitreous collagen fibrils. Eyes injected with 12.5 microg microplasmin had partial PVD, and SEM showed residual fibrils covering the ILM. In all eyes, there was a transient reduction in the a- and b-waves of the ERG on days 2 through 7. The ERGs showed less effect with < 250 microg microplasmin.Intravitreal injection of recombinant microplasmin in the rabbit induces no ERG or retinal ultrastructural abnormalities. Pharmacologic vitreolysis with this agent may be a useful adjunct to vitreous surgery and could be used to induce PVD without vitreous surgery.",

Tak- ing account of the long distance contributions from the cc resonances, we calculate the branching ratio and the lepton forward-backward asymmetry in this model. We find that there is a strong correlation between the branching ratios of b → s γ and b → s ℓ+ℓ− processes and that the interference effect can change the b → s ℓ+ℓ− branching ratio in the off-resonance regions by up to ±15% depending on the rel- ative phase between the long and short distance contributions. Using various phe- nomenological constraints including the branching ratio of b → s γ, we show that there are regions in the parameter space where the branching ratio of b → s ℓ+ℓ− is enhanced by about 50% compared to the SM. We also show that the branching ratio of b → s νν is reduced at most by 10% from the SM prediction.",

All manufacturing systems are constrained by one or more bottlenecks. Improving the bottleneck will improve the whole system. Yet, finding the bottleneck is no trivial task. Furthermore, the system may change over time or due to random events, and subsequently the bottleneck may shift from one machine to another machine. The shifting bottleneck detection method determines the bottleneck based on the duration a machine is active without interruption. The method is very robust, easy to apply and able to detect the primary and secondary bottlenecks in a wide range of production systems. This allows the use of simulation to predict bottlenecks for both steady state and variable systems. The measurement of the likelihood of a machine being the bottleneck aids in the decision-making regarding the allocation of the available resources.",

However, recent analyses in teleosts revealed another essential role of germ cells: feminizing the gonads. In our study, medaka mutants in which gametogenesis was blocked at specific stages provides the novel view that the feminizing effect of germ cells occurs in parallel with other reproductive elements, such as meiosis, the sexual fate decision of germ cells, and gametogenesis. Germ cells in medaka may have a potential to feminize gonads at the moment they have developed.",

        "abstract": "Two cDNA clones of cytochrome P-450 aromatase (P-450arom) were isolated from a medaka (Oryzias latipes, a daily spawner) ovarian follicle cDNA library using a medaka P-450arom genomic DNA fragment as a probe. The first, 1,809-bp insert (S81f) contains an 1,554-bp open reading frame encoding a 518-amino-acid polypeptide. The second, 1,852-bp (S52f) insert possesses an open reading frame identical to that of the S81f insert, except for the absence of the heme-binding region as the result of an additional A residue at the position of nucleotide 1,827. Expression of the S81f cDNA, but not of the S52f cDNA, in nonsteroidogenic COS-1 cells leads to production of a steroidogenic enzyme which is capable of converting exogenous testosterone to estrogen. The P-450arom genomic DNA fragment hybridizes to a single mRNA in medaka ovarian follicle RNA. Changes in level of P-450arom transcripts and P-450arom enzyme activity were determined in medaka ovarian follicles collected at 16 stages of development. A close correlation was found between these two profiles, both being high in midvitellogenic follicles and low in postvitellogenic follicles collected during oocyte maturation. These findings, together with those of our previous study showing that actinomycin D prevented gonadotropin-induced aromatase activation by medaka ovarian follicles, suggest that aromatase activity is regulated at the transcriptional level in medaka vitellogenic follicles.",

After the germ cells have migrated into the gonadal areas, a cluster of EGFP-expressing cells in the single gonadal primordium was found to be separated by the somatic cells along the rostrocaudal axis and form the bilateral lobes. We observed in these transgenic fish that EGFP expression persists only in the somatic cells directly surrounding the germ cells. As sex differentiation proceeds, dmrt1 and foxl2 begin to be expressed in the EGFP-expressing cells in the XY and the XX gonads, respectively. This indicates that the sox9b-expressing cells reorganize into two lobes of the gonad and then differentiate into Sertoli or granulosa cells, as common precursors of the supporting cells. Hence, our sox9b-EGFP medaka system will be useful in future studies of gonadal development.",

We describe a first case of keratitis caused by Nocardia exalbida.\n \n \n \n Methods  Case report\n \n \n \n Results  A patient presented after two weeks of unsuccessful treatment of a corneal ulcer in her right eye. Nocardia keratitis was diagnosed from her culture results, and the species Nocardia exalbida was determined by phylogenetic studies using gene sequence analysis of 16S RNA. The disk diffusion method showed that this\n Norcardia sp. was sensitive to many antibiotics. Initially, the patient was treated with topical and systemic antibiotics, and corneal\n epithelium quickly regenerated. But when corticosteroid eyedrops were added, there was a recurrence of the keratitis. Corticosteroids\n were stopped, and systemic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and topical tobramycin, colistin, chloramphenicol and sulfisoxazole\n were given. Within one month the corneal ulcer and infiltration disappeared.\n \n \n \n Conclusion  This is the first report of keratitis caused by Nocardia exalbida. This species is susceptible to many antibiotics in vitro and clinically. However, supplementation with corticosteroids can\n lead to recurrence, and care should be taken when corticosteroids are being considered.",

        "abstract": "Allocating buffers in manufacturing systems is one of easi- est ways to improve the throughput of the system, as changes can be implemented quickly and the initial cost of the change is low. Yet, while an increase in the buffer size usually increases the throughput, it often also increases the work in progress and the makespan, therefore increasing the inventory and the time to the customer. Subsequently, the trade off between the throughput, the work in progress, and the makespan are of significant research interest. This paper describes a general prediction model of these per- formance measures for different buffer size increases based on only a single simulation. A fully automated implemen- tation of the simulation analysis and prediction model for manufacturing systems of any size and complexity is avail- able. The method can be used for flow shops, job shops, and serial or parallel systems.",

        "abstract": "During the last two decades, DNA sequencing has led to the identification of numerous genes in key species; however, in most cases, their functions are still unknown. In this situation, reverse genetics is the most suitable method to assign function to a gene. TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is a reverse-genetic strategy that combines random chemical mutagenesis with high-throughput discovery of the induced mutations in target genes. The method has been applied to a variety of plant and animal species. Screening of the induced mutations is the most important step in TILLING. Currently, direct sequencing or nuclease-mediated screening of heteroduplexes is widely used for detection of mutations in TILLING. Both methods are useful, but the costs are substantial and turnaround times are relatively long. Thus, there is a need for an alternative method that is of higher throughput and more cost effective.In this study, we developed a high resolution melting (HRM) assay and evaluated its effectiveness for screening ENU-induced mutations in a medaka TILLING library. We had previously screened mutations in the p53 gene by direct sequencing. Therefore, we first tested the efficiency of the HRM assay by screening mutations in p53, which indicated that the HRM assay is as useful as direct sequencing. Next, we screened mutations in the atr and atm genes with the HRM assay. Nonsense mutations were identified in each gene, and the phenotypes of these nonsense mutants confirmed their loss-of-function nature.These results demonstrate that the HRM assay is useful for screening mutations in TILLING. Furthermore, the phenotype of the obtained mutants indicates that medaka is an excellent animal model for investigating genome stability and gene function, especially when combined with TILLING.",

As OSM is expressed in adult as well as embryonic hematopoietic tissues, OSM has been considered to play a role in hematopoiesis. To uncover roles of OSM, we have generated mutant mice deficient in the OSM-specific receptor beta subunit (OSMR). While OSMR-/- mice were healthy and fertile, hematologic analysis of OSMR-/- mice demonstrated that the numbers of peripheral erythrocytes and platelets were reduced compared with wild-type mice. Consistent with this, progenitors of erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages were reduced in OSMR-/- bone marrow (BM), suggesting that OSM is required for the maintenance of erythroid and megakaryocyte progenitor pools in BM. To investigate whether OSM acts on the hematopoietic progenitors directly or indirectly, we performed BM transplantation experiments. The OSMR-/- mice, engrafted with wild-type BM cells, failed to produce erythrocytic and megakaryocytic progenitors to the levels in wild-type mice, indicating that OSM affects hematopoietic microenvironments. On the other hand, erythrocytic and megakaryocytic progenitors were reduced in the wild-type mice reconstituted with OSMR-/- BM cells. Thus, OSM regulates hematopoiesis in vivo by stimulating stromal cells as well as hematopoietic progenitors, in particular megakaryocytic and erythrocytic progenitors.",

Southern hybridization analysis of trout genomic DNA with the cDNA suggested the presence of a single gene encoding 3β-HSD in the rainbow trout showing a total genomic size of less than 4 kilobases (kb). The cDNA hybridized to a single species of mRNA isolated from rainbow trout ovaries; the 1.4 kb transcripts were most abundant in trout ovaries during the later stages of oogenesis. The trout 3β-HSD expressed in non-steroidogenic monkey kidney tumor (COS-1) cells showed a unique enzymatic 3β-HSD activity. Dehydroepiandrosterone was a more favoral substrate of the trout 3β-HSD than 17α-hydroxypregnenolone. Interestingly, the trout 3β-HSD expressed in COS-1 cells exhibited minimal ability to convert pregnenolone to progesterone.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted in respect to age, sex, underlying disease, visual acuity, findings in the anterior and posterior segments, fungal culture of surgical specimens, fever of unknown origin, neutrophils < or = 500/mL, Cand-tec > or = x 4, beta-D-glucan > or = 20 pg, and final visual acuity.The patients were 34 men (74%) and 12 women (26%) between 18 and 78 years of age (mean 57.2 years). Thirty-three of the 46 patients (72%) also were diagnosed with cancer. Fungal infiltration limited to the retina (Stage I) was noted in 13%, budding in the vitreous cavity (Stage II) in 40%, vitreous opacity (Stage III) in 29%, and retinal detachment with Stage III (Stage IV) in 18% of 79 eyes with EFE. Forty patients (87%) were undergoing intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH). The mean interval between the start of IVH and the onset of disease was 11 days. Vitreous surgery was performed in 26 eyes (33%). Candida albicans was detected from surgical specimens in 38%. Fever of unknown origin was noted in 76%, neutrophils < or = 500/mL in 67%, Cand-tec > or = x 4 in 57%, and beta-D-glucan > or = 20 pg in 90% of subjects.In patients susceptible to opportunistic infection, beta-D-glucan > or = 20 pg (90%), IVH (87%), fever of unknown origin (76%), male sex (74%), the presence of cancer (72%), neutrophils < or = 500/mL (67%), and Cand-tec > or = x 4 (57%) were considered to be predisposing factors for the development of EFE.",

        "abstract": "Social familiarity affects mating preference among various vertebrates. Here, we show that visual contact of a potential mating partner before mating (visual familiarization) enhances female preference for the familiarized male, but not for an unfamiliarized male, in medaka fish. Terminal-nerve gonadotropin-releasing hormone 3 (TN-GnRH3) neurons, an extrahypothalamic neuromodulatory system, function as a gate for activating mating preferences based on familiarity. Basal levels of TN-GnRH3 neuronal activity suppress female receptivity for any male (default mode). Visual familiarization facilitates TN-GnRH3 neuron activity (preference mode), which correlates with female preference for the familiarized male. GnRH3 peptides, which are synthesized specifically in TN-GnRH3 neurons, are required for the mode-switching via self-facilitation. Our study demonstrates the central neural mechanisms underlying the regulation of medaka female mating preference based on visual social familiarity.",

In this study, we cloned a cDNA encoding a FTZ-F1-like protein (mdFtz-F1) from ovarian follicles of medaka. In vitro translated mdFTZ-F1, and nuclear extract from medaka ovarian follicles, formed complexes with oligonucleotide probes containing putative orphan nuclear receptor binding motifs, which are present in the promoter region of the medaka P-450arom gene. The expression pattern of mdFtz-F1 transcripts during oogenesis coincides with that of P-450arom transcripts. Transfection assays further suggest a potential transcriptional regulatory activity of mdFTZ-F1 upon the medaka P-450arom promoter. Taken together, these results suggest a potential role of mdFTZ-F1 in the transcriptional regulation of P-450arom in the ovarian follicle of medaka.",

        "abstract": "We examined the effects on sexual differentiation of nanoinjecting ethinylestradiol (EE2) into embryos of olvas-GFP/ST-II YI medaka (Oryzias latipes). This strain contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fused to the regulatory region of the medaka vasa gene, and germ-cell-specific expression of GFP can be visualized in living (transparent) individuals. The number of germ cells in untreated genotypic females (XX) was approximately 10-fold that in untreated genotypic males (XY) at 10 d posthatch (dph). Germ cell proliferation was prevented in XX females that developed from embryos nanoinjected with 0.5, 2.5, or 5.0 ng of EE2. Some 10-dph XY males from embryos injected with 0.5 ng or more of EE2 showed a larger fluorescent area and more germ cells than those of pooled control groups. Males and females from embryos injected with 5.0 ng of EE2 had no significant difference in germ cell number or fluorescent area. Thus, EE2 injection into embryos caused abnormal gonadal development in both sexes. Observations of external secondary sex characteristics and histological examination of adult gonads showed complete sex reversal in some males after 0.5-, 2.5-, and 5.0-ng treatments but no changes in XX females after any treatment. Thus, quantitative bio-imaging can aid in evaluating the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on fish within 10 dph.",

        "abstract": "\n Résumé  Un net changement de la stéroïdogenèse, passant de la production de testostérone à celle de 17α-hydroxy-progestérone, apparait\n dans les cellules ovariennes de la thèque des salmonidés, juste avant la maturation ovocytaire. Ce changement est un prérequis\n pour la production de 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnene-3-one (stéroïde inducteur de la maturation chez les salmonidés), par les\n cellules de la granulosa, durant la maturation ovocytaire. Le cytochrome P-450 portant l'activité 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase\n (P-45017α) et la 3β-hydroxystéroïde déshydrogénase/Δ5−4-isomérase (3β-HSD) sont les deux enzymes stéroïdogènes majeures impliquées dans la synthèse de la 17α-hydroxyprogestérone\n et de la testostérone. En utilisant des sondes ADNc de mammifère, nous avons isolé et caractérisé un ADNc complet codant pour\n ces deux enzymes, à partir d'une librairie d'ADNc de cellules ovariennes thèquales de truite arc-en-ciel (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Le clonage d'un ADNc, de 2,4 kilobase, codant pour le P-45017α, et l'expression transitoire de ce clone dans des cellules non stéroïdogènes de tumeur de rein, COS-1, de singe, ont été\n récemment rapportés (Sakai et al. 1992). Nous avons isolé un ADNc de 1,4 kilobase qui s'hybride avec l'ADNc mammalien de la 3β-HSD. L'expression de cet ADNc,\n dans les cellules COS-1, conduit à la production d'une enzyme capable de convertir la déhydroépiandrostérone en androsténédione.\n Une discussion est faite sur l'évolution des activités enzymatiques et de l'expression de la P-45017α et de la 3β-HSD, dans l'ovaire de truite arc-en-ciel, en rapport avec la modification de la stéroïdogenèse apparaissant dans\n les enveloppes du follicule ovarien.\n \n ",

The germ cell-deficient medaka reveals multiple effects of germ cells on the process of sex differentiation. The previously isolated mutant medaka, hotei, with the excessive number of germ cells may support the contention that the proliferation of germ cells is related to feminization of the gonad. Futhermore, we show that two modes of proliferation for either maintenance of germ cells or commitment to gametogenesis are important components of the sex differentiation of medaka developing gonads. An intimate cross talk between germ cells and gonadal somatic cells during the sex differentiation will be discussed.",

Therefore, in order to improve the performance, it is necessary to improve the constraints, also known as the bottlenecks. Finding the bottlenecks, however, is not easy. This paper compares the two most common bottleneck detection methods, based on the utilization and the waiting time, with the shifting bottleneck detection method developed by us, for AGV systems. We find that the two conventional methods have many shortcomings compared to the shifting bottleneck detection method. In the example presented here, conventional methods are either unable to detect the bottleneck at all or detect the bottleneck incorrectly. The shifting bottleneck detection method not only finds the bottlenecks but also determines the magnitude of the primary and secondary bottlenecks.",

Recently, specific β subunit of OSM receptor (OSMRβ) was isolated from LO cells originated from aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. In this study, we performed in situ hybridization to explore the expression pattern of OSMRβ during murine embryogenesis, postnatal development, and in adult tissues. At 11.5 days postcoitum (dpc), the expression of OSMRβ was first detected in aortic endothelial cells of the AGM region. At 14.5 dpc, its gene expression was clearly observed in the primordia of some organs, including liver, thymus, choroid plexus, and limb, and persisted into postnatal mice. After birth, its gene expression became detectable in the other organs, such as lymph node, bone, heart, kidney, small intestine, nasal cavity, and lung.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides a novel method for detecting bottle- necks in manufacturing systems and the shifting of these bottlenecks. All manufacturing systems are constrained by one or more bottlenecks. Improving the bottleneck will improve the whole system. Yet, finding the bottleneck is no trivial task. Furthermore, the system may change over time or due to random events, and subsequently the bottle- neck may shift from one machine to another machine. The shifting bottleneck detection method determines the bottle- neck based on the duration a machine is active without in- terruption. The method is very robust, easy to apply and able to detect the primary and secondary bottlenecks in a wide range of production systems. This allows the use of simulation to predict bottlenecks for both steady state and variable systems. The measurement of the likelihood of a machine being the bottleneck aids in the decision-making regarding the allocation of the available resources.",

Unmodified ß- and ?-CDs exhibited high enantioselectivities. a-CD could scarcely separate the enantiomers before and after dimethylation, but obtained enantioselectivity after trimethylation. On the other hand, dimethylation of ß-CD removed much of its high enantioselectivity. Moreover, the chemical modifications produced a reverse in the migration order of the enantiomers. The inclusion of dansyl-DL-phenylalanine with CDs was evaluated using 600 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that medaka primordial germ cells (PGC) are first distinguishable by olvas expression during late gastrulation, and that they migrate to the gonadal region through the lateral plate mesoderm. Here, we demonstrate that medaka nanos expression marks the germ line at early gastrulation stage. By marking the germ line with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the nanos 3' untranslated region, we were able to visualize the behavior of PGC using time-lapse imaging. We show that there are three distinct modes of PGC migration that function at different stages of development. At early gastrulation stage, PGC actively migrate towards the marginal zone, a process that requires the function of a chemokine receptor, CXCR4. However, at late gastrulation stage, PGC change the mode and direction of their movement, as they are carried towards the midline along with somatic cells undergoing convergent movements. After aligning bilaterally, PGC actively migrate to the posterior end of the lateral plate mesoderm. This posterior movement depends on the activity of both HMGCoAR and a ligand of CXCR4, SDF-1a. These results demonstrate that PGC undergo different modes of migration to reach the prospective gonadal region of the embryo.",

In this fish model, most of the pigments are genetically removed from the entire body by a combination of recessive alleles at four loci. The main internal organs, namely, heart, spleen, blood vessels, liver, gut, gonads, kidney, brain, spinal cord, lens, air bladder, and gills, in living adult fish are visible to the naked eye or with a simple stereoscopic microscope. This fish is healthy and fertile. A transgenic see-through medaka was produced by using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fused to the regulatory regions of the medaka vasa gene, in which germ cell-specific expression of GFP was visualized. The fluorescent tag also efficiently improved visibility of gonadal tissues. The process of oocyte maturation in the ovary was monitored by repeated observations from the outside of the body during one spawning cycle in the same living females of the transgenic see-through stock. The see-through medaka will provide an opportunity for noninvasive studies of morphological and molecular events that occur in internal organs in the later stages of life.",

We used the topography-mode program of the OCT Ophthalmoscope and measured the average height of the retinal detachment. By multiplying the size of the area of the retinal detachment and the average height of the retinal detachment, the volume of subretinal fluid could be determined.

        "abstract": "At the onset of liver development, cardiac mesoderm, septum transversum mesenchyme, and endothelial cells are involved in the specification and/or proliferation of hepatoblasts. After this initial stage, however, it is unclear which cells support the proliferation and differentiation of hepatocytes. Here we characterized the nature of mouse hepatic mesothelial cells (MCs) and investigated their role in organogenesis.Using anti-podocalyxin-like protein 1 (PCLP1) and anti-mesothelin antibodies, we characterized MCs during liver development by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and gene expression analysis. The possible role of MCs in hepatogenesis was investigated by in vitro culture and analysis of Wilms' tumor 1 homologue (WT1) knockout mice.PCLP1 was highly expressed in immature MCs, covering the surface of lobes. PCLP1 expression in MCs was down-regulated along with development, whereas mesothelin expression was up-regulated, indicating that these molecules distinguished developmental stages of MCs. The proliferation potential of MCs was high in the fetus and declined after birth. Fetal MCs expressed various growth factors and strongly enhanced the expansion of fetal hepatocytes in vitro, whereas differentiated MCs exhibited less growth factor expression, and differentiated MCs failed to enhance hepatocyte proliferation in vitro. In WT1-deficient embryos, hepatocyte proliferation was impaired due to defective MCs.The mesothelium is not only an inert protective sheet covering the parenchyma but also changes its characteristics dynamically during development and plays an active role in organogenesis by promoting expansion of parenchymal cells.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and portal fibroblasts (PFs) are 2 distinct mesenchymal cells in adult liver. HSCs in sinusoids accumulate lipids and express p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). HSCs and PFs play pivotal roles in liver regeneration and fibrosis. However, the roles of mesenchymal cells in fetal liver remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to characterize mesenchymal cells in mouse fetal liver.We prepared an anti-p75NTR monoclonal antibody applicable for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. p75NTR(+) cells isolated from fetal liver by flow cytometry were characterized by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and cell cultivation. Lipid-containing cells were visualized by Oil-red O staining.p75NTR(+) cells in fetal liver were clearly distinct from endothelial cells and showed characteristics of mesenchymal cells. At embryonic day (E) 10.5, p75NTR(+) cells were present at the periphery of the liver bud in close contact with endothelial cells, and spread over the liver at E11.5. With the formation of the liver architecture, they began to localize to 2 distinct areas, parenchymal and portal areas, and lipid-containing p75NTR(+) cells increased accordingly. p75NTR(+) cells around portal veins were adjacent to cholangiocytes and expressed Jagged1, a crucial factor for the commitment of hepatoblasts to cholangiocytes. By cultivation, p75NTR(+) cells showed features of adult HSCs with markedly increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and alpha-smooth muscle actin.p75NTR(+) mesenchymal cells in fetal liver include progenitors for HSCs and PFs, and the anti-p75NTR monoclonal antibody is useful for their isolation.",

        "abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic liver disease that progresses from simple steatosis to the disease state of inflammation and fibrosis. Previous studies suggest that apoptosis and necroptosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH, based on several murine models. However, the mechanisms underlying the transition of simple steatosis to steatohepatitis remain unclear, because it is difficult to identify when and where such cell deaths begin to occur in the pathophysiological process of NASH. In the present study, our aim is to investigate which type of cell death plays a role as the trigger for initiating inflammation in fatty liver. By establishing a simple method of discriminating between apoptosis and necrosis in the liver, we found that necrosis occurred prior to apoptosis at the onset of steatohepatitis in the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet model. To further investigate what type of necrosis is involved in the initial necrotic cell death, we examined the effect of necroptosis and ferroptosis inhibition by administering inhibitors to wild-type mice in the CDE diet model. In addition, necroptosis was evaluated using mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) knockout mice, which is lacking in a terminal executor of necroptosis. Consequently, necroptosis inhibition failed to block the onset of necrotic cell death, while ferroptosis inhibition protected hepatocytes from necrotic death almost completely, and suppressed the subsequent infiltration of immune cells and inflammatory reaction. Furthermore, the amount of oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine, which is involved in ferroptosis pathway, was increased in the liver sample of the CDE diet-fed mice. These findings suggest that hepatic ferroptosis plays an important role as the trigger for initiating inflammation in steatohepatitis and may be a therapeutic target for preventing the onset of steatohepatitis.",

        "abstract": "The occluding junctions between the nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells in the Rhesus monkey have been studied with the electron microscope using horseradish peroxidase as a tracer and the freeze-fracture technique. These junctions can be divided into two distinct classes: one type is made of parallel strands, while the other type consists of a net-like meshwork of junctional strands. The occluding junctions in the pars planar and the valley of the ciliary process are mainly of the parallel type which is composed of between three and 15 strands. After pilocarpine instillation, the straight and parallel strands in these portions became wavy but remained intact. This finding suggests that during accomodation the blood-aqueous barrier is maintained by changing the shape of the occulding junctions so as to resist the contraction of the ciliary muscle. The second type of junctional strands, made up of from five to 18 ridges and grooves, is mainly seen in the crest of the ciliary process. Following repeated paracentesis, every ciliary process of almost all the experimental monkeys developed cysts in the ciliary processes but only at their most anterior portion. The cyst walls were ruptured at several locations. The cysts, the intercellular spaces and the posterior chamber contained fibrin. In freeze-fractured replicas of these specimens, the occluding junctions at the anteriormost portion of the pars plicata were normally composed of from one to five strands of the parallel type, and which were often fragmented after paracentesis. This observation indicates that the occluding junctions in this portion of the ciliary process may be responsible for the leakage of the serum protein into the posterior chamber that is observed after paracentesis.",

The results are highly accurate, distinguishing between bottleneck machines and non-bottleneck machines with a high level of confidence. This approach is very easy to use and can be implemented into existing simulation tools with little effort, requiring only an analysis of the log file which is readily available by almost all simulation tools.

None of the eyes had a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). The average age at the onset of BRVO was 58.7 ± 6.6 years. The interval between onset of the macular edema and injection of autologous plasmin enzyme was 4.2 months. One international unit of autologous plasmin enzyme in 0.1 mL was injected into each vitreous. The presence of a PVD was evaluated 1 week after the injection, and the visual acuity and macular thickness were measured before and 1 week and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the autologous plasmin enzyme injection.After the autologous plasmin enzyme injection, a total PVD was observed in 23 eyes and no PVD was observed in 3 eyes. The visual acuity gradually recovered after the injection, improved by 2 lines or more in 23 eyes, and remained unchanged in the 3 eyes. The retinal thickness also recovered gradually at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The mean retinal thickness was reduced from 602.12 to 253.62 μm at 12 months after surgery. It was reduced significantly after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (P < .0001).Intravitreal autologous plasmin enzyme may lead to an improvement of visual acuity and a reduction of macula edema in eyes with BRVO.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel method of calculating the sen- sitivity of the manufacturing system throughput to the vari- ables of the machines. The sensitivity analysis needs only a single simulation, yet is easy to use and provides accurate results. This sensitivity analysis is then used to predict the change in the system throughput due to a change of the variables of the machines provided that the system change does not significantly change the bottleneck. These predic- tions can be used for a local optimization, allowing the use of a steepest descent optimization algorithm. The method is based on improving the momentary shifting bottlenecks. The shifting bottlenecks are detected using the shifting bot- tleneck detection method based on the active duration, i.e., the time a machine is active without interruption. The method is easy to understand and easy to implement in ex- isting simulation software.",

        "abstract": "Hepatoblasts are hepatic progenitor cells that expand and give rise to either hepatocyte or cholangiocytes during liver development. We previously reported that delta-like 1 homolog (DLK1) is expressed in the mouse liver primordium at embryonic day (E) 10.5 and that DLK1(+) cells in E14.5 liver contain high proliferative and bipotential hepatoblasts. While the expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in hepatic stem/progenitor cells has been reported, its expression profile at an early stage of liver development remains unknown. In this study, we show that EpCAM is expressed in mouse liver bud at E9.5 and that EpCAM(+)DLK1(+) hepatoblasts form hepatic cords at the early stage of hepatogenesis. DLK1(+) cells of E11.5 liver were fractionated into EpCAM(+) and EpCAM(-) cells; one forth of EpCAM(+)DLK1(+) cells formed a colony in vitro whereas EpCAM(-)DLK1(+) cells rarely did it. Moreover, EpCAM(+)DLK1(+) cells contained cells capable of forming a large colony, indicating that EpCAM(+)DLK1(+) cells in E11.5 liver contain early hepatoblasts with high proliferation potential. Interestingly, EpCAM expression in hepatoblasts was dramatically reduced along with liver development and the colony-forming capacities of both EpCAM(+)DLK1(+) and EpCAM(-)DLK1(+) cells were comparable in E14.5 liver. It strongly suggested that most of mouse hepatoblasts are losing EpCAM expression at this stage. Moreover, we provide evidence that EpCAM(+)DLK1(+) cells in E11.5 liver contain extrahepatic bile duct cells as well as hepatoblasts, while EpCAM(-)DLK1(+) cells contain mesothelial cell precursors. Thus, the expression of EpCAM and DLK1 suggests the developmental pathways of mouse liver progenitors.",

        "abstract": "Pituitary gonadotropins (GTHs) are of primary importance in triggering oocyte growth and maturation. However, the actions of GTHs are not direct, but are mediated by the ovarian production of steroidal mediators of oocyte growth (estradiol-17β) and maturation (maturation-inducing hormone, MIH; 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, 17α,20β-DP in salmonid fishes; 17α,20β,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, 20β-S in sciaenid fishes). It is established that production of estradiol-17β and 17α,20β-DP by salmonid ovarian follicles occurs via the interaction of two cell layers, the thecal and granulosa cell layers (two-cell type model). A distinct shift in the salmonid steroidogenesis from estradiol-17β to 17α,20β-DP occurs in the ovarian follicle layer immediately prior to oocyte maturation. It is possible that this shift is a consequence of dramatic changes in the expression of the genes encoding various steroidogenic enzymes. As an initial step to address this question, we have isolated and characterized the cDNAs encoding a number of ovarian steroidogenic enzymes including the rainbow trout cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD), 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase cytochrome P-450, aromatase cytochrome P-450 cDNAS as well as the pig 20β-HSD cDNA.Estradiol-17β stimulates the hepatic synthesis and secretion of a yolk precursor, vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is then transported to the ovary where it is selectively taken up into the oocyte by a receptor-mediated process involving specific cell-surface receptors. Estradiol-17β was also shown to induce the synthesis of egg membrane proteins in the liver. The maturation-inducing action of 17α,20β-DP and 20β-S is through the binding to the oocyte plasma membrane. This initial MIH-surface interaction is followed by the formation of the major mediator of MIH, maturation-promoting factor (MPF). We have purified MPF from mature oocytes of carp. Carp MPF consists of two components: the homolog of the cdc2(+) gene product of fission yeast (p34(cdc2)) and cyclin B. The cdc2 kinase protein is present in immature oocytes as well as in oocytes induced to mature by 17α,20β-DP treatment, while cyclin B proteins can be detected only in mature oocytes. Addition of bacterially expressed goldfish cyclin B to the extracts of immature goldfish oocytes induced MPF activation. These results suggest that the appearance of cyclin B protein is a crucial step for 17α,20β-DP-induced oocyte maturation in fish.",

Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a new member of the NLRR family, NLRR4, and its potential role in long-lasting memory. We generated NLRR4-deficient (NLRR4(-/-)) mice and found that they showed impaired memory retention. In hippocampus-dependent learning tasks, NLRR4(-/-) mice were able to learn and maintain the memories for one day but unable to retain the memories for four days after learning. In contrast, in a hippocampus-independent task, NLRR4(-/-) mice were able to retain the memory normally for at least seven days. These results suggest that NLRR4 plays a key role in hippocampus-dependent long-lasting memory.",

        "abstract": "A large-scale mutagenesis screen was performed in Medaka to identify genes acting in diverse developmental processes. Mutations were identified in homozygous F3 progeny derived from ENU-treated founder males. In addition to the morphological inspection of live embryos, other approaches were used to detect abnormalities in organogenesis and in specific cellular processes, including germ cell migration, nerve tract formation, sensory organ differentiation and DNA repair. Among 2031 embryonic lethal mutations identified, 312 causing defects in organogenesis were selected for further analyses. From these, 126 mutations were characterized genetically and assigned to 105 genes. The similarity of the development of Medaka and zebrafish facilitated the comparison of mutant phenotypes, which indicated that many mutations in Medaka cause unique phenotypes so far unrecorded in zebrafish. Even when mutations of the two fish species cause a similar phenotype such as one-eyed-pinhead or parachute, more genes were found in Medaka than in zebrafish that produced the same phenotype when mutated. These observations suggest that many Medaka mutants represent new genes and, therefore, are important complements to the collection of zebrafish mutants that have proven so valuable for exploring genomic function in development.",

        "abstract": "Sox9 is a transcription factor containing the Sry-related high-mobility-group (HMG) box. Mutations in human SOX9 gene cause skeletal defects and male-to-female sex reversal, indicating its essential roles in chondrogenesis and testis development. Comparative studies have shown that Sox9 is expressed in chondrogenic tissues and testis in other vertebrates. Therefore, it was suggested that roles of Sox9 in cartilage and male gonad development are conserved among vertebrates. To investigate the evolutional significance of Sox9 in the gonad and cartilage development of teleost fish, we isolated medaka sox9 and analyzed its expression. Two kinds of transcripts (sox9 and sox9lf) were isolated by cDNA library screening. The sox9 encoded 487 amino acids and showed approximately 70% amino acid identity with known vertebrate SOX9 proteins. The sox9lf was a longer form of the sox9, which was transcribed from an additional exon in the 5' upstream region. Interestingly, the expression of medaka sox9 was predominantly observed in the adult ovary by northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses, whereas in the testis, its expression was detectable only by RT-PCR. During medaka embryogenesis, its expression was observed in the cranial cartilage and pectoral fin endoskeleton. These observations suggest that the function of Sox9 in the cartilage is conserved among vertebrates, while that in the gonad is quite different in medaka.",

After optimization of their MS/MS conditions, derivatization conditions were examined. Under the optimum conditions using in-situ derivatization, the calibration curves for the TBT and TPT were linear in the ranges of 0.4 - 200 and 1.2 - 200 pg of Sn, respectively. The detection limits for TBT and TPT were 0.07 and 0.43 pg of Sn, respectively. In the case of TBT, the detection limit with 4-fluorophenylation was improved about five times compared with that with pentylation (0.35 pg). This improvement is ascribed to the bond-dissociation energy of Sn-aryl being stronger than that of Sn-alkyl. Namely, the selective fragmentation of 4-fluorophenyl TBT resulted in high sensitivity. The relative recoveries of TBT and TPT from seawater were 99 and 109%, respectively. The method was successfully applied to the seawater samples.",

In medaka, Forkhead box L3 (foxl3) was previously identified as a germ cell-intrinsic regulator of sex determination that suppresses the initiation of spermatogenesis in female germ cells. To reveal the molecular mechanism of germline sex determination by foxl3, we conducted the following four analyses: Comparison of transcriptomes between wild-type and foxl3-mutant germ cells; epistatic analysis; identification of the FOXL3-binding motif; and ChIP-qPCR assay using a FOXL3-monoclonal antibody. We identified two candidate genes acting downstream of foxl3: Rec8a and fbxo47. It has been known that Rec8 regulates sister chromatid cohesion and Fbxo47 acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. These functions have not been, however, associated with sexual differentiation in germ cells. Our results uncover novel components acting downstream of foxl3, providing insights into the mechanism of germline sex determination.",

Using fate mapping studies and ablation experiments in medaka fish (Oryzias latipes), we determined that somatic gonadal precursors arise from the most posterior part of the sdf-1a expression domain in the lateral plate mesoderm at the early segmentation stage; this region has the properties of a gonadal field. Somatic gonadal precursors in this field, which continuously express sdf-1a, move anteriorly and medially to the prospective gonadal area by convergent movement. By the stage at which these somatic gonadal precursors have become located adjacent to the embryonic body, the precursors no longer replace the surrounding lateral plate mesoderm, becoming spatially organized into two distinct populations. We further show that, prior to reaching the prospective gonadal area, these populations can be distinguished by expression of either ftz-f1 or sox9b. These results clearly indicate that different populations of gonadal precursors are present before the formation of a single gonadal primordium, shedding new light on the developmental processes of somatic gonadal cell and subsequent sex differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Migratory pathways of PGCs to the gonad vary depending on the vertebrate species, yet the underlying regulatory mechanisms guiding PGCs are believed to be largely common. In teleost medaka embryo, PGC migration follows two major steps before colonizing in gonadal areas: (1) bilateral lineup in the trunk and (2) posterior drift of PGCs. kazura (kaz) and yanagi (yan) mutants of medaka isolated in mutagenesis screening were defective in the first and second steps, respectively. kaz(j2-15D) was identified as a missense mutation in chemokine receptor gene cxcr4b expressed in PGCs. Embryonic injection of cxcr4b mRNA with vasa 3' UTR rescued the PGC phenotype of kaz mutant, indicating a cell-autonomous function of cxcr4b in PGCs. yan(j6-29C) was identified as a nonsense mutation in the cxcr7/rdc1 gene encoding another chemokine receptor. cxcr7 transgene with genomic flanking sequences rescued the yan mutant phenotype efficiently at the G0 generation. cxcr7 was expressed in somites rather than PGCs. cxcr7-expressing somitic domain expanded posteriorly with its margin immediately anterior of posteriorly drifting PGCs, as if PGCs were thrusted toward the gonadal area. kaz and yan mutants are also defective in lateral line positioning, suggesting combined employment of these receptor systems in various cell migratory processes.",

        "abstract": "Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines. Mice deficient in the OSM receptor (OSMR(-/-)) showed impaired liver regeneration with persistent parenchymal necrosis after carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) exposure. The recovery of liver mass from partial hepatectomy was also significantly delayed in OSMR(-/-) mice. In contrast to wildtype mice, CCl(4) administration only marginally induced expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 genes in OSMR(-/-) mice, correlating with the increased gelatinase activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and matrix degradation in injured livers. The activation of STAT3 and expression of immediate early genes and cyclins were decreased in OSMR(-/-) liver, indicating that OSM signaling is required for hepatocyte proliferation and tissue remodeling during liver regeneration. We also found that CCl(4) administration in IL-6(-/-) mice failed to induce OSM expression and that OSM administration in IL-6(-/-) mice after CCl(4) injection induced the expression of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, suggesting that OSM is a key mediator of IL-6 in liver regeneration. Consistent with these results, administration of OSM ameliorated liver injury in wildtype mice by preventing hepatocyte apoptosis as well as tissue destruction. In conclusion, OSM and its signaling pathway may provide a useful therapeutic target for liver regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Liver development is regulated by various extracellular molecules such as cytokines and cell surface proteins. Although several such regulators have been identified, additional molecules are likely to be involved in liver development. To identify such molecules, we employed the signal sequence trap (SST) method to screen cDNAs encoding a secreted or membrane protein from fetal liver and obtained a number of clones. Among them, we found that T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 2 (Tim2) was expressed specifically on immature hepatocytes in the fetal liver. Tim2 has been shown to regulate immune responses, but its role in liver development had not been studied. We have examined the possible role of Tim2 in hepatocyte differentiation. At first, we prepared a soluble Tim2 fusion protein consisting of its extracellular domain and the Fc domain of human IgG (Tim2-hFc) and found that it bound to fetal and adult hepatocytes, suggesting that there are Tim2-binding molecules on hepatocytes. Second, Tim2-hFc inhibited the differentiation of hepatocytes in fetal liver primary culture, i.e., the expression of mature hepatic enzymes and accumulation of glycogen were severely reduced. Third, Tim2-hFc also inhibited proliferation of fetal hepatocytes. Fourth, down-regulation of Tim2 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced the expression of liver differentiation marker genes.It is strongly suggested that Tim2 is involved in the differentiation of fetal hepatocytes.",

        "abstract": "To estimate brain damage after cardiac arrest, the concentrations of neuron specific enolase (NSE), GTP-binding protein (G 0 α), 28 kDa calbindin-D, S100b protein, and creatine kinase BB (CK-BB) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were determined by enzyme immunoassays. Ten mongrel dogs were subjected to 30 min of circulatory arrest at normal body temperature and serial CSF and blood samples were taken during the first 18 h after reperfusion. The NSE concentration in CSF increased significantly after reperfusion, reaching a 15-fold increase (243 ± 107 ng/ml, p < 0.01) 18 h later, however, it did not increased significantly in serum (8.1 ± 3.3 ng/ml vs. 23.5 ± 7.0 ng/ml). G 0 α concentration in CSF increased sharply between the 2nd and 4th h after reperfusion and peaked 18 h after reperfusion (428 ± 195 pg/ml, p < 0.01), however, it did not increase significantly in serum. Calbindin-D concentration in CSF increased between the 1st and 6th h after reperfusion, and reached a plateau thereafter (621 ± 235 ng/ml, a 23-fold increase, p < 0.05) and also increased significantly in serum ( p < 0.05). The S100b concentration in CSF also increased dramatically after the 4th h of reperfusion and reached a plateau at the 8th h after reperfusion (16.0 ± 9.3 ng/ml, a 50-fold increase, p < 0.01), however, it in serum was below the detection threshold. The CK-BB concentration in CSF peaked 4 h after reperfusion (113 ± 69 ng/ml, a 19-fold increase, p < 0.01) and it in serum increased 4-fold ( p < 0.05). The neural tissue-related proteins are thus apparently released primarily into the CSF. The CSF concentrations of these proteins are therefore specific markers for brain damage.",

Although its functions and expression have been investigated in the mouse, nanos genes have yet to be well characterized in other vertebrates. Based on similarity and a syntenic analysis of nanos, we have identified four different nanos in the genome of medaka (Oryzias latipes). nanos1 is duplicated in teleost fish genomes and named nanos1a and nanos1b. Of all medaka nanos, nanos3 is well conserved in terms of expression and synteny. In contrast to a previous study on mice, nanos2 expression was not detected in the gonads at early stages of sex differentiation; however, both oogonia and spermatogonia in adult gonads exhibit nanos2 expression. nanos1a and 1b are both expressed in the developing brain, consistent with the expression of nanos1 in mice. In the gonads, nanos1a is expressed in the somatic cells surrounding oocytes and spermatocytes, whereas expression of nanos1b is not detectable in the gonads by in-situ hybridization. These results suggest common and distinct functions of nanos genes among vertebrates.",

        "abstract": "Although the concept of a leukemic stem cell system has recently been well accepted, its nature and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Constitutive activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT5 is frequently detected in various hematopoietic tumors. To evaluate their role in normal and leukemic stem cells, we took advantage of constitutively active STAT mutants to activate STAT signaling selectively in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Activation of STAT5 in CD34- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ lineage marker- (CD34- KSL) HSCs led to a drastic expansion of multipotential progenitors and promoted HSC self-renewal ex vivo. In sharp contrast, STAT3 was demonstrated to be dispensable for the HSC maintenance in vivo, and its activation facilitated lineage commitment of HSCs in vitro. In a mouse model of myeloproliferative disease (MPD), sustained STAT5 activation in CD34- KSL HSCs but not in CD34+ KSL multipotential progenitors induced fatal MPD, indicating that the capacity of STAT5 to promote self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells is crucial to MPD development. Our findings collectively establish a specific role for STAT5 in self-renewal of normal as well as leukemic stem cells.",

Here, we propose how a tissue composed of germ cells and sox9b-expressing cells underlain by a basement membrane develops a functionally common unit that reserves sexually indifferent or unfixed germline stem cells in both the ovaries and testes of adult medaka. During testicular development, the unit expands and gives rise to lobules where germline stem cells continuously produce a tremendous amount of sperm, while the unit in the female becomes germinal cradles that represent niche areas for neo-oogenesis. A recent finding in female foxl3 mutants demonstrates that the unit can also serve as the niche for germline stem cells continuously producing sperm in the ovary. We hypothesize that this unit in medaka might correspond to the medullary cords of the gonadal primordium in amniotes and that fragmentation of the medullary cords during ovarian development may be related to the absence of germline stem cells.

This strain contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fused to the regulatory region of the medaka vasa gene, and germ cell-specific expression of GFP can be visualized in living (transparent) individuals. From 0 days post-hatch (0 dph) onwards, juveniles were exposed to graded concentrations of EE(2) (25.2-1710 ng/L) for 35 days. The gonads of live specimens were monitored by measuring their size and calculating their GFP-fluorescence area. GFP-fluorescent area in control females was about 10 times that in control males at 10 days posthatch (dph) whereas the gonadal size of 10 dph males that had been exposed to 158 ng/L of EE(2) significantly increased up to twice the size of control males, indicating that abnormal sexual differentiation towards female might occur in these individuals. Histological examination and identification of the sex-linked marker SL1 indicated that male to female sex reversal occurred at EE(2) exposure ≥45.1 ng/L at 35 dph. These results suggest that observation of proliferative activity of germ cells in the olvas-GFP/STII-YI strain could be applied to facilitated screening fish model to detect adverse effects on sexual differentiation as early as 10 dph juveniles.",

Instead, their opposite DNA strands encode functional RNA-binding motif protein 8 (RBM8s), which is also encoded by another locus, 5q13-q14. To elucidate the mechanism through which such multiple human GnRH-RII/RBM8 loci arose, here we have defined an RBM8 locus in a comparative model species, the medaka Oryzias latipes. The medaka RBM8, which exists as a single copy gene, is linked to, but does not overlap with, GnRH-R2 on linkage group (LG) 16, demonstrating the ancient origin of the physical linkage between GnRH-R and RBM8. The medaka LG 16 contains orthologous segments to the human chromosome 1 and therefore the 1q12-q21 locus would be an originating human GnRH-RII/RBM8 segment. Furthermore, like the human RBM8s on 1q12-q21 and 5q13-q14 but not that on 14q21-q23, the medaka RBM8 is a multiexon gene, indicating that the 14q21-q23 and 5q13-q14 loci were generated by retrotransposition and segmental genomic duplication, respectively, of the originating 1q12-q21 locus.",

Visual acuity improved in about 50% of the eyes. Both visual acuity and foveal thickness recovered 12 months after surgery and the improvement of visual acuity occurred later than the recovery of foveal thickness. The preoperative systemic condition does not affect the improvement of visual acuity, and thus it is not necessary to wait for good diabetic control if surgery is indicated.",

        "abstract": "The performance of a manufacturing or logistic system is determined by its constraints. Therefore, in order to improve the performance, it is necessary to improve the constraints, also known as the bottlenecks. Finding the bottlenecks, how- ever, is not easy. This paper compares the two most com- mon bottleneck detection methods, based on the utilization and the waiting time, with the shifting bottleneck detection method developed by us, for AGV systems. We find that the two conventional methods have many shortcomings com- pared to the shifting bottleneck detection method. In the ex- ample presented here, conventional methods are either un- able to detect the bottleneck at all or detect the bottleneck incorrectly. The shifting bottleneck detection method not only finds the bottlenecks but also determines the magnitude of the primary and secondary bottlenecks.",
